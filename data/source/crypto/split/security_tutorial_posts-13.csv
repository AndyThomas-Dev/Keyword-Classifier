"Silk Road 2 Forums","The Jigsaw Puzzle","44164","2014-06-22T06:30:06","OPSec for Windows","Discussion/Security"," You'll want to use a Desktop Bitcoin Client only. Multibit has been around for ages now and still works well (make sure you you keep a copy of your BTC Wallet (your Wallet's Private Key) and password protect all the Wallet/s you have in Multibit and store them off the computer in a secure place. As Bliss said, Bitcoin-Qt is another excellent option and is even more secure if you install Armory over the top of it. The only issue with this BTC Client is it will initially require you to download the entire Blockchain before use so it can sync with the BTC Network and start working where as Multibit doesn't require the network to be downloaded at all. F.Y.I - The initial download process for Bitcoin-Qt and other similar Clients can be a lengthy exercise for anyone with a slower Internet connection, sometimes taking hours to complete. Once the initial download is complete, it will work straight away from that point on.","Quote from: Bliss on June 22, 2014, 05:21:46 amNo problem mate, here to help a brother out.Mind if I ask another question then? HahaWhat type of local wallet do you use? One to deposit your coins in after you purchase them from LBC for example.I've downloaded Electrum and Multibit recently, but I still don't feel very comfortable about depositing my coin into either of those wallets. My Electrum wallet says it is disconnected from the server, so I don't want to risk trying to deposit and end up losing coins. I may be over thinking the process, I'm not sure. I just want to get some coins in a personal wallet of mine ASAP."

I downloaded Multibit last night and have created a wallet. So you're saying I should have a copy of my wallet on an encrypted USB drive perhaps?  As of now I have it saved to my Persistent folder.  I don't plan on downloading the entire blockchain, my internet connection is very slow, so I could see it being an extremelyyyy lengthy process, as you stated.","Quote from: BootiusMaximus on June 22, 2014, 05:30:19 amQuote from: Bliss on June 22, 2014, 05:21:46 amNo problem mate, here to help a brother out.Mind if I ask another question then?

So I can send coins to my Multibit wallet, even without it being online? Can I also send those coins out to a tumbler w/o it being online?","I would keep a copy of your Wallet's Private Key and a copy of the Wallet's password somewhere secure so it will never get lost. That's so important because it's like losing your credit card at work but can't get another one, even though there is still thousands of dollars in your account available to use. Your Persistent Folder is fine as long as you don't forget your passphrase to get into it. You can store a copy of your Wallet's Private Key on an encrypted USB drive as well if you like, that's fine. Multibit is a great little piece of software that works well without having to download the entire Blockchain. "

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whiteshark","6330","2013-12-06T22:09:06","btc is falling deep... any reason?!","Discussion/Security","China's government banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin, in what analysts said was a restrained first step towards regulating the digital currency that has exploded in popularity in China and soared in value in recent months. A statement by the central bank and four other agencies said that, while the computer-generated currency does not yet pose a threat to China's financial system, it carries risks. It did not, however, curtail the use of bitcoin by individuals. ""I think it's measured and it's positive,"" said Zennon Kapron, of the financial consultancy Kapronasia. ""It does add legitimacy to the idea that it could be a nationwide accepted currency."" Advertisement The value of bitcoins on Chinese exchanges fell after the announcement, however, with one expert predicting the price could halve in the short-term. Digital currencies are generally highly volatile. Bitcoins have seen their value relative to the dollar skyrocket some 800 per cent in the past two months as speculators have piled into the currency, according to bitcoinity.org. While there is no official data available, bitcoin market operators say Chinese nationals are major participants in the market and hold an outsized share of the total number of bitcoins in circulation. Shanghai-based BTC China has recently become the world's largest bitcoin exchange by volume. A statement on the website of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said that the government would act to prevent money laundering risks from bitcoin, which is not backed by a government or central bank. The PBOC may have cause to be concerned about bitcoins, which are anonymous, untraceable, and can be carried on memory sticks or transmitted electronically, because they represent a potential hole in the country's capital controls. However, analysts point out that, given the tiny value of the total bitcoins in circulation relative to other currencies, it is unlikely to have much impact on the wider economy. Eyes on bitcoins More cause for worry is the way these digital currencies have engendered a new wave of creative criminality focused on hacking online platforms and stealing bitcoins stored there, and their potential for use in money laundering, bribery and purchases of illicit products such as drugs and weapons. The government will require trading platforms that deal in virtual currencies such as bitcoin to register with telecommunications authorities, it said. The notice was issued jointly by the PBOC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission and China Insurance Regulatory Commission. ""This is an industry that will need to be governed or regulated. The safety and the well-being of the common user has to be taken into consideration. All this is expected,"" said Ron Cao, Managine Director at Lightspeet Venture Partners, which recently invested $5 million in BTC China. ""'We've got a long way to go. This thing needs to be regulated at some point. We're studying it. Don't jump into it.' My read is that's the tone of the message."" Bitcoin traders sold on the Chinese government's announcement. On the Chinese platform FXBTC.com, the yuan-bitcoin exchange rate dropped as much as about 20 percent after the news before rebounding slightly to around 5,800 yuan per bitcoin in heavy trading. On BTC-e, the dollar-bitcoin rate had fallen about 11 per cent to about $US945 from $US1,063 before the news. Cao said he would not be surprised to see the value of bitcoins fall as much as 50 per cent over the next week or two. Many bitcoin proponents say the currency's volatility will have to flatten out before it can be adopted more widely as a near-frictionless means of payment and regulation may help. More regulation was likely, although the initial ban on financial institutions may eventually be lifted, analysts said. ""I would be cautious about jumping the gun and taking today's announcement as indicative as how the space will be regulated in the future,"" said Mark Natkin, of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. ""Once they have a better idea of how the market works and which players are likely to emerge as the leading players, then they'll come out with firmer regulations, with more specific licensing requirements,"" and possibly minimum capital requirements for firms entering the sector, he said.

","Discussion/Security","Astor's post to running a relay from the old forum.. just included the orginal tutorial post here..  Discussion => Security => Topic started by: astor on August 16, 2013, 03:34 am    Title: HOWTO: Run a relay and help the Tor network   Post by: astor on August 16, 2013, 03:34 am       Since people expressed interest in running relays, I've written a guide       that can get you set up. There are many ways to run a relay, so for the       sake of simplicity, I will focus on virtual private servers running       Ubuntu 12.04. Feedback is definitely welcome.        This guide includes instructions for Windows users. I will write Linux       instructions in a separate post, and if someone would like to add Mac       instructions, I'd greatly appreciate it.         ===Finding a Hosting Provider===        In order to run a relay, you will need a dedicated server or a virtual       private server. There are two features you should look for:        1. Geographical location       2. Bandwidth        Other specs like RAM and CPU tend not to matter until the bandwidth gets       really high, like on an unmetered server. Most of the time, your       bandwidth limits will keep the Tor client well below your RAM and CPU       limits.        There is no minimum amount that you need to spend on a server. You can       lease a VPS for under $10 a month or a dedicated server for hundreds of       dollars. I think every little bit helps, especially if the servers are       geographically diverse. For this guide, I'm going to assume you don't       want to drop hundreds of dollars on your first server, so we'll focus on       setting up a small to medium sized VPS. The price range I'm thinking is       $10 - $50 a month, which should give you 512 MB to 1 GB of RAM and 200 GB       to 1 TB of bandwidth.        I'm not going to make specific recommendations for hosting providers, for       obvious reasons, but most relays are in North America and Europe. It       would be nice if we had more relays in South America, Asia and Africa.       The infrastructure in Africa is the most underdeveloped, so you may want       to focus on finding providers in South America and Asia. They will be       more expensive than providers in North America and Europe. If you can't       find providers in your price range, it's OK to run a relay in North       America and Europe. As I said, every little bit helps.        Another thing to consider when searching for a VPS is that there are       different virtualization technologies. These include OpenVZ, Xen, VMWare,       Virtuozzo, and KVM. For this guide, I'm going to recommend running your       relay in an OpenVZ container, because it is one of the most popular       virtualization technologies, it is generally cheaper than the others for       the same specs, your operating system will be installed for you by the       hosting provider, and the OpenVZ connection limits aren't really a       problem with low bandwidth relays. If you want your relay to push more       than 1 TB of traffic a month, you should switch to something like Xen or       KVM, or a dedicated server.        It's a good idea to read reviews of the hosting provider before ordering,       but this can be tricky. There are a lot of fake web sites with shill       reviews. In general, well-known forums with large communities (like       webhostingtalk.com) are a better place to look for reviews than random       web sites.        When you find a provider that you like, look for their Acceptable Use       Policy (AUP), which will sometimes be part of their Terms of Service       (TOS). Most hosting providers have links to these documents on their main       page. Read through them to find out if they ban proxies. If there is no       mention of Tor, &quot;proxies&quot; or &quot;open proxies&quot; almost       always include Tor. Some hosting providers specifically ban Tor. Some       only ban exit nodes. The latter case is OK, because we will be setting up       non-exit relays. You don't want to waste time setting up a relay that       will be shut down a week later because it violates your hosting       provider's AUP.          ===Ordering a Server===        Once you find a hosting provider, you can create an account and order the       VPS. I don't see a problem with leasing a VPS with your real identity.       There are 4300 relays at the moment. You will be lost in a big crowd.       However, you shouldn't mention that you set up a relay in this thread or       anywhere else on the forum! You shouldn't use information (like a       username) that links you to your Silk Road identity! If you really want       anonymity, at the end of this guide there's a section that offers some       suggestions, but keep in mind that takes a lot more work.        During the ordering process, you will be asked to choose an operating       system. Select Ubuntu Server 12.04, so we can simplify things. Every VPS       provider should have an OpenVZ image for that OS. If the VPS has 512 MB       of RAM or less, use the 32 bit version. If it has 1 GB or more, use the       64 bit version.        A common box that you have to fill out is the &quot;domain name&quot;.       You don't need a domain name to order a VPS. You can fill in anything,       like example.org. For the server name, put anything you want, it will       become the hostname. If it asks for DNS information, just put ns1 and       ns2, it doesn't matter.        Also, lease the VPS on a monthly basis for the first few months, even if       there are discounts for longer terms. Your VPS may turn out to have       crappy networking or frequent reboots, so you don't want to pay for a       year of hosting and be forced to abandon the VPS after a month.        After ordering, you'll get an email with the IP address and login details       of your VPS.          ===Configuring the Relay===        The first thing we need to do is figure out the RelayBandwidthRate based       on the monthly bandwidth limit of the VPS. Keep in mind that most hosting       providers count both incoming and outgoing bandwidth, so Tor relay       traffic gets counted twice. A VPS that pushes 1 TB of traffic from the       perspective of the hosting provider, actually pushes 500 GB of traffic       from the perspective of the Tor network (it's the same data, coming and       going).        Let's say your VPS is allowed 1 TB of traffic per month. That's 1,000,000       MB. So the rate (per second) that you would use in your Tor configuration       is:        1,000,000 / 30 / 24 / 60 / 60 / 2 = 0.192 MB or 192 KB        This is a good place to start. In practice, most relays don't max out       their bandwidth. In fact, many relays only use 30-50% of their max       bandwidth rate. You can watch the bandwidth of your relay for a few weeks       and increase it if you are using much less than your limit. For example,       if in the first two weeks it uses 250 GB (and could have used 500 GB,       because that's half of your 1 TB per month), then you can double the       RelayBandwidthRate. It can take a few weeks of adjusting to find the       right balance.        After you get the login information, download PuTTy from the web site:        http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe        This program lets you connect over a protocol called SSH, or Secure       Shell, which creates an encrypted connection to a command prompt on the       server. Run PuTTy and fill out the following information:        Host name (or IP address): <your VPS IP address>       Port: 22       Connection type: SSH        Before we go any further, click on the words &quot;Default Settings&quot;       under &quot;Saved Sessions&quot; and click the Save button to the right       of it. That way you don't have to enter the IP address each time.        Then click Open. You'll see a prompt to accept the server's host key,       click Yes. You only have do this the first time.        login as: root       password: <what you were given>        Note that you can resize the window if it's too small.        The first thing you should do after logging in is change the root       password, especially since it was emailed to you in plaintext. Do that       with the following command:        Code: [Select]       passwd        And enter the password twice.        BTW, for all of these commands, you can copy them from this guide and       paste them into PuTTy by right-clicking in the command prompt window.        Now type        Code: [Select]       nano /etc/apt/sources.list        Add this line at the end of the file:        Code: [Select]       deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org precise main        Enter the following sequence to save the file and exit: ctrl+x, y, enter        Enter the following lines into the command prompt to install Tor and the       relay monitor ARM:        Code: [Select]       apt-get update       apt-get install deb.torproject.org-keyring       apt-get update       apt-get install tor tor-arm        Hit Y[enter] whenever it asks you to confirm an action. The first install       command will give you a warning because you haven't imported the PGP key       for that software repository yet, which is what you're doing with that       command.        Now we'll edit the configuration file to turn our Tor client into a       relay. First, backup the original configuration file:        Code: [Select]       cp /etc/tor/torrc /etc/tor/torrc.backup        If you screw something up, you can restore Tor to its default state with       the following commands:        Code: [Select]       cp /etc/tor/torrc.backup /etc/tor/torrc       service tor restart        Let's edit the configuration file:        Code: [Select]       nano /etc/tor/torrc        Find the following lines and remove the # at the beginning. Anything that       follows a # is treated as a comment instead of an instruction to Tor, so       we are adding these instructions.        Code: [Select]       ControlPort 9051              # This is a comment that Tor ignores, but       everything before the hash is an instruction that Tor reads       CookieAuthentication 1        ORPort 9001                   # Change this to ORPort 443  !!!!        Nickname ididnteditheconfig   # Change ididnteditheconfig to whatever       nickname you want, no spaces, nothing drug or SR related        RelayBandwidthRate 100 KB     # Change 100 KB to whatever you calculated       for your server earlier       RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KB    # Make this double the value above. If you       server is using too much bandwidth, make this the same as the line above        ContactInfo Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>  # Create a       throwaway email address and put it here        ExitPolicy reject *:*         # This line makes your relay a non-exit        Then type: ctrl+x, y, enter        Code: [Select]       service tor reload        Congratulations, you're running a relay!        The RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst are what you will probably       want to adjust after a few weeks of watching your relay's bandwidth.        A note about the contact info. You don't need to enter a name. Remove the       &quot;Random Person&quot; part entirely. However, you should enter a real       email address. The purpose of providing an email address is if your relay       is misconfigured, the Tor people can contact you and tell you about it.       On the other hand, this email address will appear in your relay's       descriptor, which is public, so use an alternate address from any of your       main ones.        There is a program called ARM (Anonymous Relay Monitor) that lets you       monitor your relay. To run it, type:        Code: [Select]       arm        You can click the left and right arrow keys to see the different panels       of info. To exit arm, type: q, q        Another way to view info about your relay is to search for it on https://       atlas.torproject.org        Finally, to exit the SSH session, type:        Code: [Select]       exit          ===Securing Your Server===        The following is not necessary, but it's an extremely good idea.        A better way to log in to your server is to create a regular user       account, disable root logins, create an SSH key for your regular user,       and disable password logins. That makes it virtually impossible for       someone to break into your server (people try to hack into servers       through SSH all day long).        To create a regular user account, enter this command:        Code: [Select]       adduser <username>        Change <username> to any one-word username you want.        Enter the password for that user twice, and make it different from root's       password. Leave the rest of the prompts (like Full Name) blank by hitting       enter through them, then hit y at the end.        You can test out your new user. Exit the SH session and launch PuTTy       again. Now that you have a regular user, you can add it to the PuTTy       configuration so you don't have to type it in every time.        In the configuration window that you get when PuTTy launches, go to       Connection -> Data        Auto-login username: <the regular user you created>        Go back to the Session section, highlight &quot;Default Settings&quot;,       and click Save again. Connect to your server. You should only have to       enter the password this time, and of course it will be your regular       user's password.        When you login as the regular user, you can't do much outside of your       home folder. You can't install or remove software. This is a security       feature. You have to become root. In order to do that, type:        Code: [Select]       su        And enter root's password.        To exit being root, type exit, and to completely exit the SSH session,       type exit again.        Let's make this even more secure by adding an SSH key.        Download this program and run it:        http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe        Next to &quot;Generate a public/private key pair&quot;, click Generate.       This will take a few minutes. Click around randomly to create entropy and       speed it up.        When it's done, it'll say &quot;Public key for pasting into OpenSSH       authorized_keys file&quot;. Copy the entire thing in the box. Log into       your server as the regular user and type this:        Code: [Select]       mkdir .ssh       nano .ssh/authorized_keys        Paste that public key in (by right-clicking once, as before). Then hit       ctrl+x, y, enter.        Back in PuTTyGen, enter a key pass phrase and confirm it, then click       &quot;Save private key&quot; and save it somewhere on your computer. The       pass phrase protects your private key just like with PGP. At this point       you can exit out of PuTTyGen.        Now launch PuTTy again, and in the configuration window, go to Connection       -> SSH -> Auth.        Find the field that says Private key file for authentication, click       Browse and select your private key.        Go back to Session, highlight &quot;Default Settings&quot; and Save.        Connect to your server again. This time it will ask you for the pass       phrase to your private key, not the password to the regular user.        If you login successfully, great! You can disable root and password       logins. Type:        Code: [Select]       su       nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config        Find these lines:        Code: [Select]       PermitRootLogin yes             # Change it to no        #PasswordAuthentication yes     # Remove the # at the beginning and       change it to no        Save and exit with ctrl+x, y, enter.        Restart the SSH server:        Code: [Select]       service ssh restart        Exit completely out and log back in as the regular user. You should login       just fine. To test your settings, you can change PuTTy to login as root       and it should deny you.        Now think about what an attacker has to do to get into your server. First       he has to guess your regular username. Then he has to steal your private       key or brute force one that works with your public key. That's like       having a 2048 bit password! Then he has to guess root's password. Your       server is very secure.          ===Server Maintenance===        You should login in to your server every once in a while and update the       software. Login as the regular user, change to root (su), and issue these       commands:        Code: [Select]       apt-get update       apt-get dist-upgrade          ===Purchasing a Server Anonymously===        As I said before, I don't think it's necessary, but if you want to get a       server anonymously, here are some ideas that may or may not work.       Suggestions are definitely welcome.           The first thing you need to realize is that the vast majority of hosting       providers use fraud detection services, because hackers and spammers love       leasing servers anonymously or with stolen credit cards. You almost       certainly can't sign up with a hosting provider from a Tor exit node. A       popular fraud detection sevice called MaxMind claims to block VPNs and       open proxies too:        https://www.maxmind.com/en/ipauthentication        If you really want to be anonymous, I don't think you should be using a       VPN anyway, because you're trusting their word that they don't log, or       that LE won't compel them to log in the future. The best way to find a       &quot;clean&quot; IP address is to point Tor browser at a web proxy.       There are web sites that list thousands of them, but for obvious reasons       I won't list them here. You may have try many web proxies before you find       one that isn't blocked.        The other issue is payment method. There are a few dozen hosting       providers that accept bitcoins, which you could use by anonymizing them       your normal way, but all of the ones that I know about are in North       America and Europe, which doesn't help the diversity of the Tor network.       Again, if you really want to be anonymous, that's fine because a relay in       NA or EU is better than no relay.        Other than bitcoins, there are a few potentially anonymous payment       methods with fiat currency.        1. Prepaid debit cards       2. e-currency and precious metals exchanges, like Pecunix       3. an anonymous PayPal account        MaxMind claims to block prepaid debit cards:        https://www.maxmind.com/en/ccv_overview        So I don't know if that will work.        As far as e-currency exchanges go, Liberty Reserve is gone, so I don't       know what else exists other than Pecunix, but by routing money through       several exchanges, you can potentially anonymize it. You'll have to find       a hosting provider that takes these payment methods, or cash out to a       different payment method.        Also, you might be able to register a PayPal account by pointing Tor       Browser at a web proxy, and use fake info that is geographically close to       that proxy, then go to Freenode #bitcoin-otc or localbitcoins.com and       sell BTC for PayPal credit that gets deposited to your account, then use       that to pay for the server.        All of these methods involve some work and a high chance of failure, but       you're welcome to try them.

I myself run Linux and had to boot Windows in a VM in order to get the specific PuTTy instructions. The whole point was to make it easy for average people, who are almost universally on Windows. If we want to increase the number of Tor relays, we must address them, not just the tech experts who are already on Linux or BSD. They don't need a guide like this.  What are the odds that you are comsec from the old forum? Because you're making the same basic arguments, which make technology and security inaccessible to the average person.  Running a hidden service takes expertise, which is why I say average people shouldn't do it (while comsec actually fucking recommends it).

This is a guide that makes running relays accessible to that huge swath of internet users who could greatly increase the size of the network. ","Torservers.net has full guides, that are updated, and better.

However, most people using Macs have no clue what that stuff is, and use their Macs for Social media, and web browsing. Sheeple... Sheeple... Sheeple...","just another reason not to use proprietary OS's and software. OSX is so ridden with security vulnerabilities by default, it's takes nearly half an hour to patch them after a clean installation. the firewall being turned off by default being just one example. it's ridiculous. and they have most likely backdoored their OS and software since they joined the Prizm program (which only happened after Steve Jobs died, btw). they certainly admitted to this mirage they had done so a couple years ago after i got hacked/rootkitted while a vendor, and i'm currently in the process of trying to get copies of those phone calls. we shall see...but reading any forensics site/blog will tell you FileVault is a sinch to crack as well. and with hibernation mode on by default, sleepimages, virtual memory, ect can easily reveal not only passwords to your computer, but usernames and passwords to sites you visited as well, all in plain text, with a little bit of command line. turn your computer OFF, not just sleep, if you are using OSX for SR related things. but even then NVRAM can store some not so good things/settings even when powered down. fx, airport settings from a previous session OSX session were carried over into my next Tails session. so in all reality, if you do use a Mac, at least use Tails on a write-only medium like DVD-R for any illegal/SR-related activities. and opensource software for secure communications such as IM, ect, as this thread implies. but even then i'm still concerned about malware affecting low-level boot processes before Tails even has a chance to boot. a topic i'm currently researching.alot can be learned from reading forensics sites normally intended for LE. peacemirage"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","7798","2013-12-12T03:45:29","encryption app for Google and Apple phones?","Discussion/Security"," Your use of countermail makes me more than a little bit nervous. In my view, using Countermail is a potential opsec failure. For starters, Countermail requires you to enable Javascript in your browser -- for Tor users, this is the literal kiss of death for anonymity.   If you paid for your account (and I don't see any options for a free account, except for a 7 day trial period) I sincerely hope you used BTC as opposed to a traceable payment method.   The cardinal rule to remember is: NO ONE WILL EVER BE WILLING TO GO TO JAIL TO PROTECT YOU.         If the law comes knocking, Countermail will hand over everything they have on you. As we have seen with Lavabit's Ladar Levison, the authorities will even go as far as attempting to force providers to hand over the SSL keys, keep records, or otherwise snoop on all their customers in order to get to someone.   Now, I fully realize that Countermail is in Sweden, and unlike Lavabit in the U.S., the FBI simply cannot waltz-in with a National Security Letter (NSL), and demand that the provider turn themselves inside-out to provide them with the information they're looking for.   That said, I'm not entirely certain just how much protection is conferred by Countermail's location in Sweden. In any case, I'm reasonably sure that Sweden is a signatory to the Mutual Law Enforcement Assistance Treaty (MLAT). As you may recall, MLAT was used by the DEA in Operation Raw Deal in 2007, as well as by the FBI in their recent takedown of Silk Road 1.   The ONLY protection you can ever have is for your provider to know NOTHING useful about you. It is a cardinal principle that one cannot be forced to hand over that which one does not have.

Should be pinned, particularly the part: The ONLY protection you can ever have is for your provider to know NOTHING useful about you. ","Quote from: bbkf on December 12, 2013, 01:50:54 amNightcrawler, offer your opinions on my provider, Countermail.Your use of countermail makes me more than a little bit nervous. In my view, using Countermail is a potential opsec failure. For starters, Countermail requires you to enable Javascript in your browser -- for Tor users, this is the literal kiss of death for anonymity. If you paid for your account (and I don't see any options for a free account, except for a 7 day trial period) I sincerely hope you used BTC as opposed to a traceable payment method. The cardinal rule to remember is: NO ONE WILL EVER BE WILLING TO GO TO JAIL TO PROTECT YOU.       If the law comes knocking, Countermail will hand over everything they have on you. As we have seen with Lavabit's Ladar Levison, the authorities will even go as far as attempting to force providers to hand over the SSL keys, keep records, or otherwise snoop on all their customers in order to get to someone. Now, I fully realize that Countermail is in Sweden, and unlike Lavabit in the U.S., the FBI simply cannot waltz-in with a National Security Letter (NSL), and demand that the provider turn themselves inside-out to provide them with the information they're looking for. That said, I'm not entirely certain just how much protection is conferred by Countermail's location in Sweden. In any case, I'm reasonably sure that Sweden is a signatory to the Mutual Law Enforcement Assistance Treaty (MLAT). As you may recall, MLAT was used by the DEA in Operation Raw Deal in 2007, as well as by the FBI in their recent takedown of Silk Road 1. The ONLY protection you can ever have is for your provider to know NOTHING useful about you. It is a cardinal principle that one cannot be forced to hand over that which one does not have. Frankly, I've always regarded Countermail as rather gimmicky -- in particular, I don't trust this idea of diskless servers -- I'm not entirely convinced that one can run a sizable business using these methods.

About singapore, i had a look at their death penalty laws.............    heres a look at singapore laws regarding the death penalty  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Singapore and the mandatory death penalty In Singapore, draconian drug laws mandate the death penalty for anyone who imports more than 15 grams of heroin,  30 grams of cocaine or 500 grams of cannabis. Prominent Singaporean lawyer, K.S. Rajah, has been highly critical of the mandatory death penalty in Singapore. In his speech, ""The Mandatory Death Sentence"", Mr Rajah argues that Singapore violates customary international law by maintaining a mandatory death penalty. The problem with the mandatory death penalty is that a judge cannot look at the circumstances of the case and ensure that justice is done. All judicial discretion is removed and the judge must sentence the offender to death.  According to Amnesty International, Singapore executes more people per capita than any other country.  Read K. S. Rajah's speech on Mr Nguyen's case and The Mandatory Death Sentence in Singapore (22 March 2005).  See also the international anti-death penalty organisation Hands Off Cain page on Singapore.

Being a Jew is not just a religion, it is an ethnic group I can't choose not to be Caucasian anymore than you can choose not be whatever ethnic group you belong to.  Someone whose grandad was half Jewish, who had never read the Torah in their life, went to the ovens exactly the same as the local Rabbi. There was no choice involved in that, the only choice was to get out of Germany while they could, and most couldn't.  The idea that the state organised attempt to exterminate an entire ethnicity from a continent, is in any way comparable with the state murdering individuals for choices they have made is ridiculous.    Again, the death penalty is wrong full stop. It is disgusting for drugs offences, but when you decide to play the game, you have to accept the possible outcome.   The Jewish population of Germany didn't make a decision to belong to an ethnic group.  Imbeciles who smuggle smack to Thailand made a decision and need to man up, take some responsibilty and fucking well deal instead of crying about it like a little girl who was told not to touch the oven but burnt herself anyway..    If I drive my car at 100MPH, wrap it around a tree and end up crippled, I can't whine about it, it was my doing.  If you walk on a high narrow ledge, there is always a chance you will fall and break your neck, don't walk on narrow ledges unless you are at peace with this basic  fact. ","People kind of do choose to be Jews. I was raised Christian and am now an athiest. You can choose what you believe just as easily as you can choose whether or not you like drugs.

Being killed for merely providing a service to other people by smuggling drugs cannot be rationally justified.  Humans have always sought drug experiences and will continue to do so. Demand for drugs will never stop. Why should it? It is a part of life and no so called law can be more meaningful than a humans right to do with his own body whatever he damn well pleases. I really don't understand why things like that are still happening.  I guess it's because it's just more profitable overall to keep drugs illegal and put people in prison or even kill them for committing drug crimes. Evil corrupted moneyhungry abusers of power continue to rule all over the world and we still let it happen. But on the upside we have services like Silk Road as well recent developments in countries like Uruguay and parts of the US where first steps toward a more rational drug policy are taken.  The overall situation is still pretty sickening though. I hope to see a lot more positive change in my lifetime, but I'm rather pessimistic about it...",""

Prominent Singaporean lawyer, K.S. Rajah, has been highly critical of the mandatory death penalty in Singapore. In his speech, ""The Mandatory Death Sentence"", Mr Rajah argues that Singapore violates customary international law by maintaining a mandatory death penalty. The problem with the mandatory death penalty is that a judge cannot look at the circumstances of the case and ensure that justice is done. All judicial discretion is removed and the judge must sentence the offender to death.According to Amnesty International, Singapore executes more people per capita than any other country.Read K. S. Rajah's speech on Mr Nguyen's case and The Mandatory Death Sentence in Singapore (22 March 2005). See also the international anti-death penalty organisation Hands Off Cain page on Singapore."

Now, there is the question of whether you believe prison should be punitive, or reformative.  I don't really think trying to do both works, you have to decide on one and go hard at it.    That gets tricky when you consider the difference between killing one person with a lot of ambiguous circumstances, or a he said/she said rape case without physical evidence, or the hypothetical baby killer above.  That is quite a spectrum.  Of course, only a few things should even be illegal in the first place as most of us here can agree.  Basically, violence only, whether physical or financial or whatever.  But hurting someone else.  Otherwise, legalize it.  The state should never have the right to kill its own citizens, or any other human being.  That kind of thing is what got us into this shitty global situation over time.  Same thing with vigilante justice.  That can be tempting but again it is a slippery slope and part of what got us here over time.  How different is killing the above baby raper from lynching the ""nigger"" that ""whistled at a white lady""?  And what about when they come for YOU for some reason, legit or just because they think you did something you didn't?  Now, even the concept of the state is complex and problematic to me.  I would be more inclined to pursue smaller, local, democratic self-governing collectives.  But you could still have a fair trial by your peers similar to US justice system but one that is actually fair and not generally crooked as fuck with attorney's switching from one side to the other (happens all the time), pigs lying on the stand constantly and planting evidence (happens all the time), crooked ass gangster judges, and an entire system that is built to allow the richest to out-lawyer the rest and win by attrition whether you are guilty or innocent.  /rant lolz",""

I feel like many instances where people were killed by LE could've been avoided if they weren't so trigger happy or used the many non-lethal weapons they have. However if someone is causing a real problem for many people i.e. oppression, terrorism, and the like and no other method of stopping them works (they just get right back to it after attempting to stop them) then they should probably be dealt with more permanently. LE could also make less of a scene about that as well. We should be able to feel safe in our society and not have to be lied to in order to feel that way.  As for the death penalty for drugs, absolutely horrible. The death penalty itself like I said should only be used in incredibly extreme cases. And drugs should never have been made illegal in the first place. It's the fact that they are illegal that causes most of the ""drug"" related problems. If they should have any restrictions it should be in a way that would prevent a user from hurting others such as no driving while dosing or if using them has caused you to be a menace to your family and even then it should be easy to get help or be informed without persecution.   The war on drugs has never made sense to me. I can at least understand (even if I don't agree with it at all) why cannabis was made illegal since it makes logical sense for a newspaper company to want to stop a potential competing product. (But no corporation should be able to change laws in their favor, therein lies a critical failing of the justice system) But psychedelics? Dissociatives? Really? I can't understand why they should be illegal except for possible harm to others which could be stemmed by having easily accessible, non-biased information about them and safe environments to purchase them and use them.

Maybe I'm just a bad captcha typer, that is possible. But I really pay close attention and check twice, and (I think) it just can't be that I mistype them at every login. Maybe other users experience the same.  So is it possible that the first captcha image may be spoofed in order to perform some timing attack or whatever (because after a mistype captcha the login page is refreshed)? Is it possible that within the tor network images of the size 150x35 pixel are selectively spoofed? Or is it just a bug?  I know this is a complete crackpot theory, and I actually don't really think there is something on to it. But I thought I'd bring it up for you know, just in case....  ",""

I'm just a small time buyer, but your posts are inspiring in the greater scheme of things.","there are any number of way's. anything from a physical ""sneak n' peak"", direct trojan insertation/firewire DMA snoop, to (more likely) remote browser exploits, random ""firmware/OS updates"", ect. (like i recently received on my new Android? (hmmm...go figure?) since they do not actually exist in reality? according to both the Samsung website AND Samsung support staff!)?.... but OSX Crisis (for example. which has the [goverment contracter's] ""Hacking Teams"", $250,000 a year code written all over it), was found a week later. but up until that point? there was NO known rootkit or trojan that existed on the planet with those capabilities for OSX. so i was like...uhhh?...wtf? and the closest one i found with those capabilities? (""OSX Crisis"") was found a week later. and it doesn't even require an Admin account to gain root privileges. just a user account. crazy! and therefore was able to gain low-level firmware (BIOS) as well as ""virtual"" persistance on my system! survived reboots, re-installs, 35x wipes, ect..on multiple machines, jumping drives, ect. it's a pretty crazy story. that i have yet to tell in full. but to answer your question, i only found it cuz i was stripping apart OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) in an attempt to make a more ""secure"" version of OSX to run off a flashdrive, removing all location tracking capabilities, ect, and all other software level vulnerabilaties. and in the process of stripping it down? i got down to the ""bare bones""....and the rest is history. and after obversing the rootkit's behavior (thru sloppy logging, Activity Monitor, ect. cuz even ""they"" aren't 'perfect'. technology is progressing far too fast. even for them. especially when dealing with slumdogz like 'Hacking Team'/RCS (Remote Control Systems)...and so after a week or 2? i decided to fight back....!and before you knew it? i was literally fighting an agent in 'real-time'. taking down every attempt i made to disable it. disabling all my passwords, apps, little snitch, ect. one at a time. then i'd reboot/re-install, change passwords, ect..but i couldn't keep up! then (for the SECOND time in my life) there was suddenly a ""guest"" account"" on my login screen...and mobile ""Jetpack"" wi-fi networks abound! then i'd break out Disk Warrior, ect, watch it get disabled...watch my DVD drive switch from Magittsu to Fajitsu or whatever in 'real-time'. viewing all logs during any new installation, noticed the differences, (every install was getting ""remotely"" installed)...and any new install had the ""Send Registration to Apple"" (omg?...uh? thingy/link?) 'greyed-out'...and then after a couple daze of that? they just sent me to Single User mode, ect. leaving me to fight on command line (which was NOT my speciallty at the time). and things were starting to get VERY scary! i fianlly decided to call my mom. and all of a sudden every attempt to do so was cut off! i broke out a burner and got thru and told her what was up! (and ""immediatelly"" got a call back from some 'restricted' number yelling ""how long have you had this phone? where did you get it! ect... lol!)...it was literally like THE best feeling in the world! cuz by that time i had flushed everything...and they were SOOOO pissed that little ol' mirage had gotton one (or two? or 10?) over on them, lol...  then. until all of a sudden. they wiped (almost) all my drives clean. and every flash drive attached to my hub. (which the kit had been jumping to and from automatically). as i noticed by revelaing hidden files using Onyx, ect...but to the VERY end! i WON! it was crazy/scary times. and a year before Snowden. and a week before OSX Crisis. and i ""really"" thought i was losing it....but as we know now....that ain't nothin! luckily i've been using macs since the mid-90's. and they sooner rather than later realized they had fucked with the ""wrong"" veganoid, lol....and just wiped (most) of my drives clean and gave up. but i gotz leftoverz. and so do trusted friends. and so does the ACLU. and we're workin on it! and as i mentioned, (all in this timeframe) Apple support staff straight up addmitted to me TWICE that they had backdoors for the NSA! so take it or leave it! i'm workin on gettin those phone calls! or just? run Tails ""Live"" on DVD-R when commiting felonies? regarless of the hardware you are using. although you really should be flashing your BIOS to Coreboot and physically soldering/'write-protecting' it if you truly wanna stay safe from such Alphabet Snoopkits! ""Hardening hardware and choosing a #goodBIOS [30c3] ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VvR-vsdMlQi truly feel it was only intended to be be spyware. used to collect evidence, ect, and not intended to be found. and good rootkits aren't intended to be found. that's why they are ""snoopkits""...spyware...perhaps just run bare bones linux? or Tails, ect. (litterally) on a Raspberry Pi Model A? and do some research...or ur truly fukt! cuz Tor alone will NOT protect you. or GPG (if you're not decrypting ""offline""/'air-gapped'. and i 'know' how i was de-anonymized. as i have made VERY clear both here and elsewhere. by using the same Vendor nym on the marketplace as on the forums! let alone across marketplaces! targettted Tor-traffic analysis is a VERY real thing! and i ""really"" wish Vendors at least would listen up! cuz i ""truly"" care yo! just ""Be prepared!""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","kok","2941","2013-11-13T07:06:22","Ultimate theoretical security","Discussion/Security","This thread will discuss the best possible measures that can theoretically be taken by vendors and customers. It is not likely that many if anybody will actually follow all of these steps, but some of them should be seen as mandatory for vendors.  1. Air gap customer addresses  Vendors should all have a shitty computer that doesn't have any connection to the internet. This computer should be encrypted with FDE. When vendors receive GPG encrypted addresses from customers they should burn them in bulk to DVDs. They should transfer the DVDs from the internet connected ""contact"" machine to the air gaped ""process"" machine. The process machine should have the only copy of the vendors private GPG key. When they first setup the process machine they should one time only burn a copy of their public GPG key to a DVD and transfer it in this manner to their contact machine for distribution to their customers. The vendor can decrypt messages on the process machine to obtain customer addresses. At this point the vendor should immediately make use of the address and then securely wipe the GPG encrypted ciphertext. There is absolutely no reason for vendors to store for any significant period of time the addresses of their customers, not only is it evidence that can be used against them but it is also intelligence that can be used against their customers. It is in the best interests of all involved parties if address information is destroyed immediately after use. The air gaped machine should either have  SWAP encrypted with a per boot randomly generated key (not a password) or it should have no SWAP at all. If vendors have the need to sign messages with GPG they should have a separate signing machine configured in a similar way, after generating their GPG key on the processing machine they can move one copy of their GPG key to their signing machine prior to ever having any potentially compromising input to the processing machine. Vendors can now sign messages on the signing machine and transfer them via DVD to the contact machine. For best practice encrypt all items on DVD's in truecrypt containers as well, and certainly destroy the DVD's immediately after use, preferably by scraping the foil off of them and shredding them. Keep in mind that data fragments can still be recovered and always encrypt your transfer media. This protects from hackers compromising vendors to either steal their private keys for decryption of private messages or to masqueraded as them by signing with their pricate key. It also prevents hackers from gathering lists of customers from compromised vendor systems.    2. Use physical or strong virtual isolation of network facing applications  The most secure technique would be to make a Tor Router out of an old computer. I highly suggest using OpenBSD for your Tor router as it is a perfect match for the job. Only your Tor router needs an external IP address, the computer that you interact with has only an internal IP address and is forced to route through Tor on the Tor Router. This prevents from hackers being able to get your IP address after they root you and forces them to also root your OpenBSD Tor Router, which will not be an easy task. Also, you should still use virtual isolation inside of your physically isolated box to protect from hackers who root you gathering hardware information and potentially identifying serial numbers and such. In other words, you want an OpenBSD Tor router that your primary computer is forced to route through, but you want your primary computer to be a host for a virtualization system, something like Xen is best but even virtualbox is better than nothing. Now if an attacker compromises your guest they need to break out of the hypervisor to get serial numbers or hardware information, or they can try to root the Tor Router to get your real IP address. If this is too much work for you then skip the physical isolation and just go with virtual isolation, put all of your network facing applications in a VM that doesn't know an external IP address and force them to route over Tor. However, there are still some problems with both of these configurations. You strongly protect from hackers obtaining your real IP address in either case (especially if you use physical isolation as well), and you also protect from hackers gathering hardware serial numbers and such. But you don't prevent them from spying on you. If you have FDE and the attacker is contained in a VM they need to break out of the hypervisor to get your encryption key but they can still spy on plaintexts that you send and receive. If you use air gaps as explained in step one you can protect from the attacker being able to obtain the plaintexts of messages sent to you. But we need to protect outgoing messages as well. You could run GPG on the HOST instead of inside of the guest, and copy paste ciphertext to the guest and never plaintext. This will force the attacker to need to break the hypervisor to get to your plaintexts, but it isn't ideal. It is hard to do this ideally because any machine needs to bring potentially malicious public keys in and send ciphertext out. I don't know how to use a true air gap to protect from this, but you can minimize the attack vector to public encryption keys by using either virtual isolation or better yet an air gap.  Of course the attacker can still spy on everything else you do or say, but they at least can't get your IP address or any of the plaintexts of the encrypted messages you send or receive.   If you can work Amnesia into a configuration like this you will be even better off.  3. Don't carry any electronic devices with you when you ship packages and if it can be avoided don't use your own vehicle. Public transportation is your friend.  Tons of attacks come up when you start carrying transmitting electronic devices with you to your package drop offs, depending on the SIGINT infrastructure of the attacker they may be able to quickly identify you via intersection attacks. The same is true for using your own automobile. When you are dropping off packages you want to be a Ninja. You don't want to have anything identifying with you or near you.  4. Be random  You also don't want to fall into a pattern. Always shipping from fairly near to your house is bad. Always shipping from the same area is bad.   5. Don't use latex gloves only  Using latex gloves is not a sure fire way to prevent leaving fingerprints, they can conform to the ridges on your fingerprints and turn into rubber debris stamps. You should always use thicker gloves. Latex gloves are good for outer layer glvoes to be changed between coming into contact with drugs and packaging materials.   6. Interceptions are technically a solved problem  There are workable interception detection chips. Big smuggling organizations already use these. The technology exists to be able to detect with very high probability any interception of a package between point A and B. We shouldn't even need to worry about interceptions anymore, especially not big vendors importing multiple kilos. We can change the threat model to entirely one of social networking (point B can't protect very well from a malicious point A, but still being worried about the in between point C is just proof that we are not on the cutting edge in this area).   7. Fake ID?  This is debatable. Most big vendors wont work without them. They certainly make you feel safer. I know several people who they saved the asses of. I don't know how many people I know who they ended up getting sent to prison due to the intelligence they can provide to the feds, either via the feds being the fake ID vendors (which is a major risk with potential to do a great deal of damage to the community) or simply via the feds gathering intelligence from box places and looking for people with out of state ID or looking for people using ID without a matching entry in the DMV. There is a lot of potential for good and bad with fake ID and you should weigh your priorities. Is a better technique doing surveillance on the boxes of random people? Find someone who always works late and get packages sent to his house, intercepting them before he comes home from work? This seems like it is probably a better technique to me but it do0es have some risk that isn't present with fake ID boxes. You can stake out multiple different houses though and very rapidly rotate your shipping address which is a big win. You can also avoid having to get a fake ID or be on camera at any point in time. Is it morally acceptable to use people like this though?   8. Use dead man switches  When you pull a USB stick out (tied to your bracelet isn't it?) your system should immediately go into a memory wipe. You should never have your system booted up when you don't have it ready to shut down into a memory wipe at a moments notice, even if you are being tackled.  9. Using laptops can bring a lot of security advantage  Because you can keep them on your person 100% of the time. This can help protect from bugging attacks. But can it really? Wont the feds just put hidden cameras in your house when you are gone? I guess you could keep some mean dogs at home at all times to protect somewhat from sneak and peak. Or you can keep CCTV. But then the advantage of a laptop isn't needed as much. Leaving a desktop at home is a sure fire way to make the FDE worthless against any competent targeted attacker, but CCTV and dogs etc can protect from this. Bringing your laptop everywhere you go can protect from this but you probably still need CCTV. Or your best option is probably to use a laptop that you take with you everywhere that you never connect from home with. Always connect from random locations so the feds can't bug them ahead of time. But I guess they will just use long distance cameras or TEMPEST techniques.  Pretty much one you are identified you are fucked and you can only make it harder to fuck you and more likely for the police to make a mistake. But you should never rely on FDE for anything other than a last ditch shot at saving your ass. FDE might possibly work when all else fails, it isn't anything to rely on.  10. You don't have any friends  Especially if you are a vendor. For small time customers who have no plans of EVER vending you might be okay to socialize a little bit. If you are a vendor or plan to be one you should never talk about yourself or make friends from the community. You are much better off to approach things from a purely business perspective. When people start to socialize they start to make a lot of mistakes and almost all of them regret it. The only people who don't wish they didn't make friends are people who never risk going to prison for the rest of their lives.  11. You don't have any history  Even if you are a small time customer. You should have never used the name you are using before in the past. Not only that but it should be a name that would bring up tons of hits if anyone ever searched for it. The more generic your username is the better off you are.  12. You don't keep your entire supply in the same spot, especially if you are a big vendor.  If you get a kilo of MDMA and ship out  250 grams a month there is no need to ever have more than a maximum of 250 grams at your primary location at any time, even less is preferable. But how do you get your product? Well, you can perhaps store it with a friend if you are stupid enough to have any, and do dead drops to pick it up without ever going to the primary storage location where the majority is stored.  13. Split operations are actually very good for security, if you have any partners you can trust (which you probably don't)  One person handles orders the other person handles shipping. If the person who handles orders gets traced, and they are facing a very big and independent threat model, they don't have any evidence on them. The person shipping is less likely to be busted now because he outsources the customer relations operation. A single vendor is focusing on multiple different threat models and it stretches his focus and abilities, by having a split between computers/customer contact and import/export you can split the threat model over two people and have them spend more of their energy and focus on their own specialty. This is actually a great idea because the shipper doesn't even really need to trust the person handling customers, they can even be anonymous to them. This creates a level of isolation between potential attackers interacting with the customer service representatives and the shippers with the actual hard to conceal evidence and product. Middle man and drop ship operations have always been popular and they can be used for good security benefit.  14. Don't forget to spoof your MAC address very frequently if you use Wireless access points from random locations.   15. Don't forget to harden your browser. You definitely DO NOT need javascript enabled. You might not even need images, although turning images off could increase your linkability. Do you use Tor to go more places than just SR? If not you really don't even need images enabled. Strip your browser down as much as you can, everything that you remove is removing exploitable bugs with it.  16. Mix your motherfucking bitcoins  Cash in anonymously. Never cash in via a method that can easily be linked to you. In addition to this, mix your fucking bitcoins after cashing in. In addition to this, mix your fucking bitcoins before cashing out. I will leave the traditional laundering for others to give advice in regards to, but before you even get to laundering you need to UNLINK your money from criminal activities. Once you have a fat stack of cash that nobody knows you have and that has no ties to illegal activity then you can start thinking about how to make it look legit to the tax man.  ",""

Personally, I'm a belt-and-suspenders type, so I take a slightly different tack to data destruction. My personal preference is to encrypt the data in place, with a random key, prior to wiping. This can best be accomplished with a program called ccrypt, which you can download from Sourceforge: http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/  This prpogram has a couple of neat modes of operation -- you can use what the author refers to as the ""brave"" option, meaning that you will not be required to confim the password that you type in. If you do that, you can type for 5-10 seconds on the keyboard (or however long you feel is appropriate) and then hit return. The files in question will then be encrypted using AES, and the file extent will be changed to .cpt.  Because you are typing blindly on the keyboard, you won't know what the decrypt password is, and cannot be forced to decrypt the file, even if someone were to hold a gun to your head. You cannot be forced to hand over that which you do not have. So, to use it in this manner I would use the following command: ccrypt -b -e *.txt to encrypt all the files ending in .txt in that folder.

You can make all data on it unrecoverable with an enhanced secure erase. All enhanced secure erase does is tell the AES hardware on the SSD to overwrite the old AES key with a new one. The data is still on the SSD but it is impossible to recover it without breaking AES. Most modern SSD seamlessly encrypt everything stored on them for the purpose of being able to do extremely quick secure erases. Regular secure erase is better than DBAN too though. It will wipe everything, DBAN skips some things like defective sectors, ATA secure erase wipes everything. Also if you are using a SSD you really can't use DBAN to wipe it in which case you need to use ATA secure erase. Different manufacturers use different implementations of Secure Erase, it is firmware, and not all of them follow the specification properly though, so there is a chance it could fail to work correctly. Your best bet is probably do enhanced secure erase, then regular secure erase, then wipe with DBAN. With SSD I generally do three things to feel comfortable in having a wiped drive:  1. First of all, I encrypt everything that touches the drive in the first place with FDE and a password that is at least 128 characters. If I wipe the drive, I force myself to forget the password and then make a new one, never to utter the old password again. The reason for this is because there is an off chance that the  symmetrically encrypted key could still be on the drive if the other wipe mechanisms fail. An even better bet would be to boot from a USB drive that you can throw out if you need to wipe things. This by itself should make it very unlikely for anything on my drive to be recovered after the fact, but there is still the risk that the attacker already managed to get my passphrase somehow and that the lack of actual data destruction will make it potentially possible for them to recover something.  2. Second of all I do an enhanced secure erase and hope that the drive had a non-backdoored or weakened AES chip.  If this works it is similar to the first step, except that there is no password for me to forget, and if everything went according to plan then there is actually not even a copy of the encryption key in existence anymore.   3.Third of all I do a regular secure erase and hope that it was implemented correctly. This would ideally actually destroy the data on the drive, resetting it to all 1's on an SSD (a blank SSD is set to all 1's). This would make the data impossible to recover if it works.  Those are the three things I count on to make it so forensics teams can't recover incriminating data off my drive, and if any one of them works then it should be effective. I just hope that there isn't such a catastrophic failure that all three fail to work. I usually also store anything sensitive inside of a truecrypt container that I can forget the password to as well, which can help to kind of limit forensic data recovery as well, but there is so much trace evidence with using truecrypt containers alone that I don't actually rely on this to do anything except provide some level of mitigation in the case of a hopefully unlikely catastrophic failure.

The only stuff that might be left would be stuff in defective sectors that the drive can't access, but the odds of finding anything useful/incriminating in these is vanishingly small. Heidi's Eraser supposedly has a mode where you can wipe empty/unallocated sectors.  If I remember correctly, on Windows, if you delete a file, only one byte is change, so the file is no longer seen by the OS, but the data is still there. That's why using DBAN on a Windows machine is so important, so it'll get EVERYTHING.  As far as Linux is concerned, it gets very hairy, very quickly. There are multiple variables, like whether or not you're using a journaling filesystem (e.g. EXT3/4) or an older, non-journaled file system (e.g. EXT2). Again, to be sure, it's best to nuke everything.   Here is a warning to Linux users about reserved space on their drives:     These are NOT stupid questions, by any stretch of the imagination.

Is there a way to shred files that you have already removed from the trash? ;WARNINGI was shocked by how many files photorec could retrieve from my disk, even after wiping.Whether there is more security in filling the ""free space"" only 1 time with 0x00 or 38 times with different cabalistic standards is more of an academic discussion. The author of the seminal 1996 paper on shredding wrote himself an epilogue saying that this is obsolete and unecessary for modern hardware. There is no documented case of data being physically replaced zeroes and recovered afterwards.The true fragile link in this procedure is the filesystem. Some filesystems reserve space for special use, and it is not made available as ""free space"". But your data may be there. That includes photos, personal plain-text emails, whatever. I have just googled reserved+space+ext4 and learned that 5% of my home partition was reserved. I guess this is where photorec found so much of my stuff. Conclusion: the shredding method is not the most important, even the multi-pass method still leaves data in place.[...]But still, one way or another, there may be some space left.The only truly safe way is to wipe the whole partition, create a filesystem again, and then restore your files from a backup. ;sorry for the stupid questions, but my old method was just to trash already encrypted files but I'm trying to step up my game"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","bluegreen23","3867","2013-11-22T22:32:49","Destroying your drugs in front of LE","Discussion/Legal","There seems to be a lot of semi to mostly accurate info here.  Things to consider are if you are merely trying to prevent a continuity of evidence (ducking round a corner and throwing a bag of whatever in the bush) or preventing recovery of evidence (burning etc)  Bare in mind that the police can charge you without proper evidence. That they can detain you and question you, and that they can hold you for a time without a charge while they investigate/interrogate.   Continuity relates to police finding a bag of a substance and then proving it's yours. This is why people throwing something out of their car window does no good. The police need to lose sight of you so that you can toss whatever it is. Then when they find it they are going to claim it's yours, say they saw you throw it, say it has your prints on it and any other lie they can imagine. your job at that point is to (golden rule) keep your mouth shut. don't argue. don't debate. don't state that they couldn't have seen you throw it because you were around a corner. Just shut up and wait for a lawyer. Now the cops know that you have thrown it because they aren't stupid but knowing and proving are 2 separate things. You do have to be concerned with the police making a false statement saying they witnessed you throw it.   This also applies to having a drop spot to resupply from. If you are seen going repeatedly to a bush then anything in that bush will pretty much be labelled as yours.  As for destruction of evidence. Most of what I said applies. As long as you destroy beyond testing ALL material then they can't prove that you had anything illegal on you (though sulfuric acid in a motor vehicle might constitute some sort of transport of dangerous goods law, most likely in a small amount you would be looking at a fine.) The police will still pull you in, still lie to you claiming they have samples, that they know what it is, that you were ratted out by so and so and everything else. Keep your mouth shut. You may be charged with obstruction, or destruction of evidence or some other such thing. but thats something you should let lawyers settle at another time. The only thing you know for sure is that if they have proof you're screwed and if they don't have proof anything you discuss with the police will hurt your situation.   The really important thing to remember is police don't convict and few police do real police work to build a case anymore. They provide evidence (in whatever form) to the DA. The DA decides to proceed with the case, or throws it out, the DA decides what they are asking for for sentencing. The DA is who can make you deals. The police can't do shit for you. They can't cut you lose. The only way that they could cut you lose is if you last the holding period and they don't have enough evidence to be charged (mouth shut!!!) or if they use you as a rat. There is absolutely no other way the police are going to let you just magically ""walk away"" from anything.   Destruction of evidence (drugs being burned etc) or loss of continuity are legal arguments for the DA and your lawyer. ",""

If you burn it though, make sure that it's ashes to ashes, dust to dust. If there's even a little bit of color on the paper or perforations shown, it will be seized and tested further while you're waiting in a cell.   Also, the action of burning shows you had something to hide. If they have the suspicion of drugs, I would make a quick stop at your house and get rid of all traces of evidence as soon as you're free.

Imagine a setup that is Swedish VPN -> Panama VPN -> Russian VPN -> Internet. First the feds have to turn the Russian VPN (basically impossible), if they do that, all they have is the IP of the Panama VPN, then if by some miracle they turn that, they have the Swe VPN, and so on. For all intents and purposes the feds have got no fucking chance, and wouldn't even bother trying unless you were waging war on the NSA. If you had enough heat for them to try (e.g. lulzsec, DPR), they'd likely catch you through some other means (bugging your house, informants, break into your house and hack your laptop etc).   To do this reliably you'd want to do it at a hardware level, or you could achieve it using VMs (VirtualBox etc)  - Router + VPN 1 (firewalled to drop all non VPN traffic) > Router + VPN 2 > Router 3   Also  â¢ TOR connection to a VPN => OK â¢ VPN connection to TOR => GOTO JAIL   If you VPN to Tor, the VPN will have logs of your activity; BAD IDEA. If you Tor to a VPN, this hides the Tor usage from your ISP (and ergo; the feds) and also means you a Tor'ing from an IP that probably has a lot of tor traffic (the VPN), which masks your activity even further.

Can you run a regular browser and Tor at the same time - how about anything else that is connecting to the internet.

However, there is a senerio where using a VPN might be beneficial if implemented correctly.  I am not claiming this will increasy anonyminity, I am only bringing it up so we can further discuss it This is a post from the old forums. It doesn't talk about setting up QoS on the OpenVPN client to help hide Tor use, or using a seperate computer for the torrenting.  Tor's Last Stand  ","In light of recent events many are realizing that our biggest fears have come true, a global adversary has formed and is actively monitoring most of the internet. Tor was designed to protect us from those with access to only small parts of the internet but with a birds eye view intelligence agencies can correlate the unique patterns of our communications without ever having to join the network. This attack in some way affects everyone but in particular only affects two groups: Anyone accessing the clearnet and those who wish to stay off the map.Accessing the Clearnet:As it stands hidden services have not been deanonymized through this attack and remain safely hidden within the network. As the endpoint is unknown to the attacker they cannot correlate information through packetflow signatures alone (though user-based information leaks and weak correlation through forum timestamps and writing analysis may help provide insight into the source of a event within onionland). When it comes to accessing the clearnet this is where they have a definite advantage. Linked below is a test that was performed to demonstrate the nature of internet routing, and how the quickest point between A and C can sometimes (for some reason) be X Y and Z.http://i59.fastpic.ru/big/2013/0927/7c/3a6141d19fb003bd9c5442f07381d17c.jpgIt is inevitable that at some point your connection will cross a tapped internet cable and end up into an attackers hands. This does not mean all is lost; if your country is not part of the following list: USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Israel, Denmark, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Sweden, then the only surveillance they have on you is their own. When using Tor, if your exit node, the service you are connecting to, or any connection in between passes along the cables connected to any of these hostile nations then they have your endpoint packet flow. This is the inevitability of using Tor to access the clearnet, you cannot assume that they do not possess the contents of your connection. Nothing short of manual PGP message or AES file encryption will prevent them from seeing what you sent, though they may still be able to deanonymize you if they can see at any point between you and your entry guard. This is where we make our Hail Mary pass.Accessing Tor Anonymously:For those who wish to use Hidden Services anonymously they just need to connect, and unless their country is known to come after Tor users there is no risk of correlation short of user error. Those who want to access the clearnet and those who want to hide their connection to the network must take special care of the geopolitical path their connection takes to enter the network. Tor is by default configured to connect to a set of automatically chosen entry guards which the user has no control over, this presents an incredible risk as it is not possible to set where you enter into the network, leaving your connection open to interception along the way. Thankfully Tor implemented a concept called bridges which are user selected entry guards and added a feature called pluggable transports which allow for custom protocol obfuscation modules to be created to help hide Tor usage. The only transport to date is called obfsproxy which removes some identifying details of the Tor connection and may help in our attempts. Other protocol obfuscation techniques may actually serve to make more obvious your attempt at hiding so it is advised until release and subsequent review that they not be used.First download the latest pluggable transport bundle athttps://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.enYou can find bridges by going to   https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges And following the instructions on the various ways to obtain bridges. If you want to use Obfsproxy bridges then they will be prefaced with the lines ""bridge obfs3"". China is known to detect obfs2, so it is better to run obfs3. Once you have collected a list of bridges you want to use enter them into a geoiplocator such as i2plocation.com (from a public wifi spot if you are concerned for your safety) and carefully document the country of each one, removing ones located in known hostile countries (and unless you trust your government, yours as well).Next you will acquire the services of an encrypted VPN that utilizes OpenVPN who is neither incorporated in a hostile country or one that is under their control. What you will do is first connect to your VPN and start your bittorrent client (while downloading+seeding) which will be set to 'Force Encryption', this will provide uniform cover traffic, and if you trust your VPN, will prevent attackers from being able to detect your Tor packet flow signature on its way to the VPN server. It is not important to remain anonymous to your VPN, they have logs (even if they say they dont), and the attacker will see that you are connecting to the VPN.The trick here will be to use a VPN server and a bridge both located in the same non hostile country. This will ensure your connection doesnt mysteriously route itself back through NSA headquarters as is the tendency with international connections. Notice that all of the internet backbones dont run THROUGH the countries, they run around them, if your connection must cross the border there is a high chance it will end up on one of these tapped cables. Once your Tor connection leaves your VPN it is in the clear for packet flow analysis, if it makes the trip across untapped cables then the global surveillance machine only has a jumbled mix of encrypted packets across an encrypted stream heading to a VPN in a country they do not control and exiting onto a line they are not monitoring.However if for any reason your connection does traverse a hostile/tapped cable as it leaves the VPN, it will be possible for them to correlate the flow of that jumbled mix of encrypted packets you sent through your VPN, to you and the Entry node which they are watching (and yes, they are watching all nodes, as they are all connected to eachother and inevitably cross a tapped cable at some point many times per second).Once you find a set of bridge nodes that are in the same country as your VPN server connect to your VPN and perform an ip trace on the bridge address (leave Tor off for now), if you see your connection make jumps to ips outside of the country then try another bridge. This shouldnt happen but if all else fails try another VPN/bridge country. When you've found a reliable path its time to test your bridges.Enter the bridge address (test them one at a time):TOR TASKBAR ICON -> SETTINGS -> NETWORK -> ADD A BRIDGE field, click the '+' sign.And restart Tor. It will now attempt to connect to your bridge, if it fails then the bridge is dead, try some others from the same country. When you've found a working bridge clap your hands, you've just evaded the combined might of nations."

If I send to a Canadian service that re-sends down south, do they fill out the customs form, or do I?  If I ""don't know"" it's going to the US, and I'm simply sending something within my country, why would I fill out any such form when I have no idea that it's going to be sent down south?  If they don't fill out a form, how does it get through customs?  If these services are exempt from being required to have such paperwork and customs is used to seeing them send things with none, won't they be WAY more inclined to open them than if if it was a normal parcels like virtually all of the others with the typical form filled out?  If the re-shipper has to fill out the customs form, do they open it themselves to see what's inside?  Even if you find such a service, these questions need to be answered or you're asking for trouble.  As far as I know, any such legitimate service in Canada would most CERTAINLY require proof of ID.  If they're not very scrupulous, fake ID would be great for signing up in person - but if you're wanting to sign on with any such service from Peru rather than in person, surely they don't accept bitcoins or cash in the mail, and you'll need to pay with a credit card or something.  If you do use a real identity to sign on, my above questions need to be answered because chances are the answers are not favorable and you're putting yourself in grave danger by throwing the dice.  If you can get one of these services without giving them a real identity, and the receiving address is one that isn't likely to get you in trouble if something goes wrong, then the answers to those questions have a far lesser impact and don't matter nearly as much if all you really have to worry about is the possibility of losing an order.  ...and if you're able to find such a service and have reason to believe you can do this safely (or you're just a risk taker and don't give a fuck) one small thing to keep in mind is that vendors tend to ship with tracking and only compensate when tracking does not indicate a successful delivery.  If you're blow makes it to Canada but not to the US, the TN that vendor has for your tracked order will show a succesfull delivery to where you told them to send it, but your product will be lost, and the seller probably won't take any responsibility since it made it to the destination they were assigned to send it.",""

Furthermore, people who use BitcoinFog should really look into Send-Shared (blockchain.info) *clearnet warning* https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-shared which is a much more complex and safer method of breaking transaction paths. Minus BitcoinFog's outrageous fees.  Best way to stay safe is to assume everything you are doing on here is illegal and prevent any and all breadcrumbs from leading back to you, regardless of how harmless you feel your actions may seem.","No offense to anyone, but if you have any real understanding of bitcoins, then you will know that using bitcoinfog is a fool's errand.

As a vendor, of course if you send your bitcoins onto a SR wallet, you are compromising your legal status according to United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations in some ambiguous way. The act of sending and receiving bitcoins, however, is not going to be the charge. The writ of habeus corpus is what you need to be aware of. There must be proof of a. possession, distribution, sale, etc of an illicit substance, contraband, etc or b. some other clear-cut LINKED violation of USC/CFR tied directly to a bitcoin transaction, i surmise.   A gas station in my neighborhood was recently taken down due to selling ""shooters."" These are pre-loaded one-hit crack pipes. They were being sold right behind the counter, all you had to do was ask. I don't smoke crack, so I didn't know. I always just went in while my gas was pumping and grabbed an RC cola and Snicker's Almond. My money went into the same pot of money as the people buying crack. Does this mean I should be indicted?

It is even possible to open up a PO box at a location that does not have security cameras. I have seen many USPS locations (particularly the smaller ones that are not the main facility in the city or a high traffic one) that do not have any security cameras or have only one camera that watches the registers only and does not capture footage from the area where the PO boxes are. Many locations will have a seperate lobby area allowing for 24 hour access to the PO boxes so if you choose a location without cameras and go in the middle of the night when there are not any witnesses around and you will notice any cars or people who appear to be steaking out the location as they would be the only other ones there in the middle of the night. Keep in mind however if the USPS location you use does not have cameras, neighboring businesses or buildings might, and footage from those cameras may capture footage such as a vehicle you are in or even a plate number and not to mention that footage can easily be obtained by LE, even without court order by simply asking many people who are law abiding will hand over a copy of the footage to aid LE. Even many privite investigaors, many of whom are former LE will know how to approach those neighboring places and ask for a copy of the footage in a way that gets them to willingly hand over a copy. So always be mindful of every step you take and where you park, even avoid public transit as they are all generally equippend with cameras ever since 9/11 and given how the cost of installing them goes down as technology advances.  If you really want the true scoop and playbook on how to do this with the highest amount of OPSEC as if you were CIA buy from me and contact me as I will walk all of my customers through all details and protect all of my buyers even after the transaction is done.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","charas","11806","2013-12-27T16:47:36","researchers-crack-4096-bit-rsa-encryption-with-a -microphone","Discussion/Security","I was surfing, as you do, I came across this article, quite interesting reading  http://www.darknet.org.uk/2013/12/researchers-crack-4096-bit-rsa-encryption-microphone/   ++++The text is pasted below+++  So this is a pretty interesting acoustic based cryptanalysis side-channel attack which can crack 4096-bit RSA encryption. Itâs been a while since weâve seen anything hardware based, and RSA 4096 is pretty strong encryption, I wonder how they figured this one out.  Acoustic Cryptanalysis  It makes sense though when you think about it, although I wouldnât have thought about it â I wasnât even aware that processors made any audible noise when processing (even if the noise can only be picked up by a fairly high quality mic).      Security researchers have successfully broken one of the most secure encryption algorithms, 4096-bit RSA, by listening â yes, with a microphone â to a computer as it decrypts some encrypted data. The attack is fairly simple and can be carried out with rudimentary hardware. The repercussions for the average computer user are minimal, but if youâre a secret agent, power user, or some other kind of encryption-using miscreant, you may want to reach for the Rammstein when decrypting your data.      This acoustic cryptanalysis, carried out by Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir (who co-invented RSA), and Eran Tromer, uses whatâs known as a side channel attack. A side channel is an attack vector that is non-direct and unconventional, and thus hasnât been properly secured. For example, your pass code prevents me from directly attacking your phone â but if I could work out your pass code by looking at the greasy smudges on your screen, that would be a side channel attack. In this case, the security researchers listen to the high-pitched (10 to 150 KHz) sounds produced by your computer as it decrypts data.  Interesting that one of the researchers involved in this is also a co-inventor of RSA, but thatâs also a good thing â showing they are constantly trying to find ways to improve it, break it etc.  Perhaps all new encryption software will come with a feature to play some kind of white noise/music to disrupt any snooping of the high frequency CPU sounds.       Without going into too much detail, the researchers focused on a very specific encryption implementation: The GnuPG (an open/free version of PGP) 1.x implementation of the RSA cryptosystem. With some very clever cryptanalysis, the researchers were able to listen for telltale signs that the CPU was decrypting some data, and then listening to the following stream of sounds to divine the decryption key. The same attack would not work on different cryptosystems or different encryption software â theyâd have to start back at the beginning and work out all of the tell-tale sounds from scratch.      The researchers successfully extracted decryption keys over a distance of four meters (13 feet) with a high-quality parabolic microphone. Perhaps more intriguingly, though, they also managed to pull of this attack with a smartphone placed 30 centimeters (12 inches) away from the target laptop. The researchers performed the attack on different laptops and desktops, with varying levels of success. For what itâs worth, the same kind of electrical data can also be divined from many other sources â the power socket on the wall, the remote end of an Ethernet cable, or merely by touching the computer (while measuring your bodyâs potential relative to the roomâs ground potential).  Thankfully itâs a very academic type of attack and doesnât have much of a real world implication on the majority of folks, the method could be constructed for other algorithms I assume â using the same technique.  But really, how many people sit around in public places decrypting sensitive documents? I donât think thereâs many.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","playground","38374","2014-04-28T04:11:49","usb encryption facility that is portable between windows and linux","Discussion/Security"," Hi Keystream,  I found that formatting my USB key with FAT32 (referred to as vfat in linux) provided me with plenty of problems.    Naturally i had no problems running gpg4usb on a FAT32 plugged into windows, but when the same key is pluged into linux... i could execute nothing. The reason, it seems, is that Ubuntu defines vFAT as a non-executable format.  So there is no way, from the command line, to chmod a file from read-only to executable... eg:       sudo chmod +x start_linux   simply did nothing. ... even as root, it simply doesn't work.  Having invested a few hours on this i can tell you that it's a very common problem,  the linux forums are awash with reports of people struggling with the same 'read-only' issue. For anyone else suffering with this i can tell you there are two common solutions to this:  (1)  manually remount the usb stick with max permissions: # 1a. umount the usb stick sudo umount /dev/sdb<whatever>  # 1b. remount the usb stick as root with max permissions: sudo mount /dev/sdb<whatever> /media/<your_username>/USB   -t vfat  -umask=0 # hey presto, your application will now execute off the usb stick. # (you could put these instructions into a bash script and run it whenever you needed to)  (2) add an entry in your /etc/fstab file to automatically set executable permissions  whenever a usb stick is slotted into your computer. The magic line you need in your /etc/fstab file is this one: /dev/sdb<whatever> /media/<username>/FAT32  vfat  auto,uid=1000,gid=100,dmask=022,fmask=033 0 0  That will give you the correct permissions and the correct user (yourself not root)   But notice how _un_portable_ this is.   It doesn't work well for ""foreign"" linux boxes. You can't go changing the fstab file for every linux machine that you're a guest on. a. it's not your machine. b. you probably wont know the sudo password.  One option however, is to copy the gpg4usb directory from the usb stick  onto the local linux machine and execute it as a regular local program.  A second option is to segregate your usb stick into two partitions. Put FAT32 on one half, put EXT2 on the other half.   And put a copy of gpg4usb on each partition.  The problem with this scenario is that both instances can't share the same secring and pubring.  Each instance would need to have their own copy of the keys.... which automatically introduces a maintenance task remembering to ensure that both copies are consistent.     One interesting little discovery that came out of these 'researches' is that when you partition a usb drive, and set one memory area to be EXT2. The EXT2 partition becomes invisible to a windows box. You plug in a usb with two partitions into linux.. and linux sees both partitions. In windows,.... the OS only sees the FAT32 partition, the EXT2 partition is hidden.   Which is _slightly_ stealthy.  have a nice day ... and be happy  playground :-)","You can encrypt files with any gpg tool, just zip the files first before encryption if you want a ""vault"" of encrypted files.Gpg4usb is a great gpg tool, is portable and works on both linux and windows.1.

Without your public key they cannot verify your signature.  Verifying is checking someone's PGP signature against their public key.   Unless there's multiple copies of the private key. If even one person has the private key besides you it creates reasonable doubt.    Hmm, I get that Fingerprint as well. I noticed that the key is signed by 2 other keys (Nightcrawler1@tormail.org & Nightcrawler@SR2). I would imagine that the Fingerprint in his signature is to one of these other keys.    You should sign the encrypted message as that way he can verify you are the person you say you are and not just someone that found his public key.  No. Signatures verify identity. IMO this is especially important in encrypted communications as it verifies the recipient.","Is signing a message basically just proving that it is 'you' who is actually sending the encrypted message? If I send someone a message that is encrypted do I still need to send them a copy of 'my' public key?Also, I have no idea what verifying means or does...Can someone with knowledge on these 2 things chime in?;The reason I say that is that digital signatures have one additional feature: non-repudiation. If you use PGP to sign something, and the signature verifies, then that is proof-positive that you wrote it.  You CANNOT later disavow it as a forgery. That's why people need to be exceedingly careful NOT to sign anything that could be in the least bit incriminating. ;How come importing your key from here: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=809Turns up this Fingerprint?

I saw someone else do this, so I copied it.   2) It tells anyone who knows how to read it all the pertinent details about my PGP key, as follows:   - 4096 is the key size in bits;  -  R indicates that it is an RSA key;   - BBF7433B  is the short Key-ID:;  - 2012-09-22 is the date the key was created;   - Nightcrawler <Nightcrawler@SR> is the name associated with the key  As to why I include the PGP key fingerprint, that is because the fingerprint is the ultimate way of describing the key. There should be NO two PGP keys that have the same fingerprint.   In the early days of PGP, the short Key-ID: e.g. 0xBBF7433B was sufficient to describe a PGP key.  Today, however, there are enough PGP keys out there, that collisions have begun to appear if only the short Key-IDs are used.  Here is an example... in this example, two keys are found that match the short Key-ID: 0x'0x723977d5  Search results for '0x723977d5'  Type bits/keyID     Date       User ID  pub  1536R/723977D5 2001-12-27 Heribert H.

Wich means get the coins without using your ID or any money that can be traced to you. Many people use LocalBTC and pay with cash!  Or if you have an importent job and want to be as carefull as possible, many people use the different crypto currencies. In example:  Buy Feathercoins with CC > Move to another crypto currencie market > trade for another crypto currencie(like litecoins) > move to another crypto currencie market > trade for BTC.  This way you should be safer in theori, because the btc can never be linked to you. Bare in mind, this can also eat some of your money because of the fees, but you are safe atleast.  And i would do my research on the coins before buying. Worst case scenario, you gain some knowledge!   Good luck!! ",""

SWIM figures that this could be due to a number of reasons. After all, SWIM does live in a city. SWIM is probably just being paranoid, but today, SWIM was leaving SWIM's house and noticed a small, dark (black or gray) helicopter flying past and strangely, just as SWIM looked up to notice the helicopter as it was flying past, the helicopter circled back and slowly started heading in the other direction past SWIM, in the direction that it was originally coming from. Surely, a rush of paranoia came over SWIM, as SWIM began to think, ""Holy shit...why is that helicopter slowly circling back? Has it been waiting for me to leave my house or something? Why is it flying away so slowly? Clearly, it is watching or looking for something in this area."" After SWIM went back in his house, SWIM noticed that the helicopter continued to circle the area, in about a 1 mile proximity, for about 5 minutes, before the helicopter flew away. The helicopter didn't necessarily seem to be facing or looking at SWIM. So, is SWIM just being paranoid or have the feds somehow caught onto SWIM's illicit involvement with the darknet marketplaces? SWIM has never received a love letter from customs or had a package intercepted. In fact, just last week, SWIM received a few packages, successfully, from a certain marketplace. Has the government been listening in (tapping into the microphone on SWIM's smartphone device or something like that) on SWIM, as he discusses drug sales and other stuff like that? Even if so, is this reason enough for SWIM to worry, considering ""freedom of speech"" and all that? After all, maybe SWIM has been practicing their lines for their next acting gig as a drug kingpin, for all the feds know (LOL). If any of this was the case, would a helicopter even be the method of surveillance that the government would utilize on SWIM (seems a little too loud and obvious)? SWIM tends to be an overly cautious individual and SWIM would like to think that this is all just a product of paranoia. However, SWIM has never seen a helicopter like this and doesn't know what type it is. It definitely did not look like a news helicopter or something like that. As long as SWIM keeps a ""clean"" house, then SWIM should be fine, right? For the record, SWIM never discusses anything serious on their regular phone and SWIM has a clean record (no apparent reason to be on under the fed's watchful eye). SWIM discusses all illicit activity over a text encryption app on SWIM's  burner device.  Please...will somebody relieve SWIM's paranoia?",""

Obviously you know where its going and you trust them if you just want to ship it to them. I would recommend working out a delivery fee of the cash if the other end does not want to. Subtract the price to rent the car, overnight rests, food you must consume anything else to get it to him. If someone is not willing to come pick up $50,000 you are probably about to get scammed hard. That is a lot of money and anyone would be willing to even take a damn grey hound to pick that up.   Not sure what you are exchanging it for but since you have no experience moving around this amount of money and the receiver seems to be airing on the side of not being able to help you as well. Something is telling me the rest of the deal is in the exact same boat very uncertain.  The end all be all is you probably cant afford to lose the 30-50k so I would utilize a manner that makes sure it can not be claimed as lost in transit without it being pried from your hands.   Do all ballers grade the product they sell in Fluffiness Color Texture and Smell? Maybe that is why I have never seen 450k in my life let alone picked a shipment up that big. I would advise not listening to this fellow they seem to be a little off in the information they provide. Weed is graded by cure and THC levels everything is strain dependent. Not calling you out or trying to start anything but for someone so major you should be managing operations not just buying from multiple suppliers. 450k is a a lot of weed like a 1/2-3/4ton of weed. I am nothing major and maybe am ill informed but this seems like an awesome pipe dream. 100k is about the best grow operation one could dream of setting up having hundreds of plants producing hundreds of pounds every 3 months. You threw away over 3 times that.  I am not asking for anymore information just wanted to point that out before you heeded this boys advise.  Stay safe think out everything thoroughly. If it sounds to good to be true it is. If they only want the money in a shady manner that would allow them to receive it and you to receive nothing I would say not to deal with them. Or ask if you could do it in 10 payments. If it is your first time dealing with them and you are about to hand them 50k with no history it is a very very bad mistake.","Quote from: 420Boys on May 29, 2014, 06:21:32 amI'm not located in the states so I can only speak based on my experience here in Canada, but on this side of the border its really simple.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","papapimp","66342","2014-10-17T11:42:21","3 Felonies Sales And Narcotics Related .... Advice?","Discussion/Legal","Okay, so I have a friend who is a vendor here. He was busted but there's a caveat to the situation: he wasn't caught with any drugs, parcels, packaging materials, stamps, bags or scales.  2 days prior to this, a separate traffic stop and another illegal search yeilded a half pound of meth, and counterfeitting materials next to a mailbox that was never opened by LE.....  This person lives in a very large and obviously outside of his means house in an upscale neighborhood. He lives with 2 other guys that share the house. One of these guy is on misdemeanor informal probation with a search clause. This guy was pulled over just outside said residence without a licence. LE arrested him, took his keys and used it to perform a ""probation search"" even though dude was never suspected or caught with any narctoics or paraphenelia.  Vendor guy has no prior convictions for drugs or anything for that matter. When LE came to the house and announced that everyone was to make themselves known, dude being the total anarchist that he is hid out of view in his 2x deadbolted room. LE cleared the house and after questioning the occupents about whos room that was, broke in through a window and found dude hiding.  At first they tried to coerce dude with obstruction and resisting (which is funny because dude was actually live in a LoL stream when it happened and its recorded that the cops did this and he was clearly saying ""ow ow ow im not resisting please dont twist my arm i have an injury"") After dude didnt budge and they also didnt find any drugs in their illegal probation search of everyday citizens that are still entitled to their constitutional rights, they release everyone from cuffs and are leaving....  But oh wait.... we didnt look in the mail box. Fucking would be damned if dude 10 minutes before the traffic stop didnt just drop 10 or so shipments ranging from weed to heroin return addressed to a bullshit name at the residence. The mailbox is also far from the house next to the road. LE proceeds to open the mail of this imaginary person who did not come back as probation parole or searchable and finds these drugs.  For 7 hours LE continues to coerce whitnesses on scene into givin dude up which none do. Dude lets LE know that his wifes vagina is very smelly and how bad LE is at their jobs because if they were doing their jobs theyd be searching for these things only if said persons were suspects in such investigations.  LE gaslights facts to a judge to obtain a search warrant, and search dudes room finally. They came up very empty handed. A vac sealers, some mylar and flat rate usps boxes only. The mailbox had packages in it that were in 6x9 envelopes with stamps and vac sealed 3x very carefully with latex gloves worn and washes between.  LE didnt find: any drugs other than about 2 oz of marijuana and what was in mailbox, did not find any scales, bags, packaging used, stamps, vac seal bags used, or even anything in a flat rate usps box. Dude was actually smart and when he heard LE had his friend stopped, gathered everything they didnt find and buried it in the backyard guarded by 4 rednose pitbulls (the pitbulls ate T-Bones that night).  LE also did not tell the judge about the traffic stop 2 days earlier where they found narcotics but didnt clear the mailbox (since they like clearing shit that can be occupied for safety reasons of course)  Even though all of the things they didnt find, they still hooked dude up with: 11351  Felony POS/PUR F/SALE NARCOTIC 11379  Felony TRANSP/ETC CNTL SUBSTANCE 11378  Felony POSS CNTL SUB FOR SALE Bail 30k no priors.  Dude posted his bail and was released within 20 minutes since he was obviously prepared. LE hadnt finished collecting dudes personal belongings that will never be returned including encrypted PEDs, clothing, packaging and labeling not used in what was in the mailbox, and even after it was all done, they left 2 paperbags marked as evidence but somehow didnt make it into the evidence bin.  Dude has 6 other active felony complaints in another jurisdiction and worried now because the dickheads said they were going to forward the case to the federal AG for additional charges, but that could be smoke theyre blowing up his ass?  Should dude leave the country while he still can?  Does dude have a case... what about a lawsuit for monetary damages that he incurred for the incident?  Needless to say, LE is very very pissed off and really are harrassing dude now because he was ever so sly and talking shit too during his kidnapping and robbery/home invasion conducted by LE.  I am a neighbor of dude and saw some of this occur as well. LMK what you think.",""

It is obvious dude wasn't even in a ""common area"" and was forcibly exposed in his room.  Popo can claim safety, but anything found in that room is inadmissable UNLESS dude is under Parole/probation conditions, for the other felonies, or other crimes he is currently on paper for.  In the US, it also depends on the State of the Union, the county in that State, and, sometimes, even locality can play into it.

Before you know you here the question ""you wouldn't mind if we take a look at blah blah blah or do a quick search.""  First thing stay cool if you start freaking out, sweating, acting nervous your gonna give them probable cause which they may not have.  The answer no matter how its asked is  ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS ""I don't consent to searches. Say it out loud one more time ""I don't consent to searches"" Again ""I don't consent to searches."" Its not a no and it certainly isn't a yes it's always ""I don't consent to searches.""  This made very clear without the yes and no so your words can not be later used against you as you agreeing to consent that's why their are no yes and no in there.  Please keep in mind that if you step out of the car and the police start seaching and you say nothing that is considered by the courts as the as what they call implied consent which is the same thing as you agreeing.  that's why you must speak up politely say. If they threate to get a K-9 let em get a K-9 they may of they may not but its always better for you to not consent no matter what threats or the cops say.  You say this for a few different reasons number one the police are not your house or car keepers and if you consent to a search if anything is broken or things or made messy they have no responsibility to fix it or put it back the way it was.  Secondly if consent to a search anyting they find in your car in your pocession on purpose or by accident left by a friend left without your knowledge you are getting charged for it. Doesn't matter if you know about it or not according to the law the driver is responsible for the vehicle and everything inside it.   Now maybe the cops will have proable cause and maybe they won't but if you don't consent to the search and something is found your lawyer can later challenge that and get that evidence thrown out of court later if you consent to a search you forfit that right.  You are responsible for knowing your rights and exercising them, it also your right to know the law. I didn't know that was illegal or didn't know that was in my car IS NOT a legal defense and will get you no where.   ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jesus H Christ","15350","2014-01-16T23:52:21","Police and searches ie car and home","Discussion/Legal","It's important to understand why probable cause is enough to justify the warrant-less search of a vehicle. This is the worst legal advice I've ever seen, and probably will make whatever situation you're in more difficult to get out of: Seriously?  No. That does not work.  First of all, I don't know where you got the idea that they can't search the glove box or the trunk without a warrant. That might be true of some states, but definitely not all. (they can search you or any part of your car; they can't search anything other than that without one, meaning that doesn't give them the right to search your home, but all parts of your car are fair game in a traffic stop).  And second, if they ask you to step out of the car for a search, and you lock the door, they can just break your windows, especially if they've already made it known that they're about to search you. A warrantless search of your vehicle is no different than a search of your home with a warrant, so your advice would be the equivilant of stepping outside your house and locking the door when the police come to search. What good does that do? (i.e. same restrictions apply to the party being searched during any search).   But, let's say, for the sake of argument, that they haven't made their intentions known, and that you've voluntarily stepped out of the car--which is stupid in and of itself. All that does it make it more difficult for you.  Now, you've given them a reason to be suspicious; so, if they already think they had enough on you to get a judge to sign-off on a warrant, you've just given them one more thing.  And, OK, so you've gotten out of your car, the doors are locked and the evidence has been secured in the car. How does that help you?     Now, you've made the need for them to get a warrant much less urgent (because you're not going anywhere with your car or the evidence inside of it now that you've locked yourself out). So, they've got all the time in the world to get that warrant, and your car is not going anywhere. I guess you could try to flee, but I'm still not sure how that helps (especially if the car is registered in your name to your current address.  That's why the OP specifically warned not to do anything that could arouse suspicion. Because you're mobile and could easily destroy evidence, motor  vehicles can be searched (including locked portions) without a warrant.  Please don't take my word for it. These are just a handful of the many cases in the last century that address this: https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/267/132/case.html http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=500&invol=565 http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=456&invol=798 http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-184.ZS.html http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-10th-circuit/1564687.html","If you step out of the car, make sure to lock the doors behind you.

These are families.  Most of the raids end up in misdermeanor drug paraphenelia charges after they rape the fuck out of your possessions when you aren't even a drug lord, instead just a normal guy with a pipe and some grass in your closet.  It's also tragic when somebody gets shot and killed for moving the wrong way when told to stay still, children in the room, family member lost to robotic fucking murderers who get away with breaking into innocent peoples homes and terrorizing them. FUCK SWAT. FUCK THE DEA. FUCK THE POLICE, AND FUCK THE GOVERNMENT. FUCK ANY institutionalized power claiming group of armed uniformed robots who devote their one and only life to the complete destruction of peace. ",""

Just heresay from the neighborhood basiclaly, so not enough for a raid, but worthy of a knock and talk.Was guy from Raid #1 a known dealer around town, or had you never heard of him before this?

A drug agentâs professional accomplishments are directly related to his or her ability to recruit and manage a steady stream of diverse confidential informants (CIs).  Drug informants are arguably the most difficult among all informants to control and manage. However, the chances of successfully managing them are increased significantly when drug agents know what motivates them to provide information to the police.  Although CIs are a necessary tool in drug law enforcement, they must be carefully scrutinized for hidden motives. Drug agents are cautioned not to take anything a CI has to offer at face value, and to always corroborate their information either through surveillance, records, or even polygraph examinations, if warranted.  The nature of drug cases often requires a CI to become closely involved with traffickers and their police handlers alike. They are asked to befriend drug dealers for the purpose of gaining their confidence so they may later be arrested. The personal relations drug informants develop with criminals can sometimes lead them into unethical, immoral, or illegal conduct.  Some egotistical informants have personalities that make them difficult, if not almost impossible to manage. These individuals often have questionable motives for offering their services to law enforcement. When drug agents do not tightly control their informants, safety problems arise, placing department resources and personnel at risk. Each time an informant offers information, drug agents should question his motives and discontinue using him if he is not willing to accept his handlerâs specific direction. This chapter explains the most common motivational factors leading people to become informants, the professional working relationships that must exist, and the steps that must be taken to successfully manage them. Methods of keeping the informantâs identity confidential are identified in order to protect him from retaliation and keep him a viable asset for future counter-drug operations. The chapter also explains how to properly use a CI to make a controlled purchase of drugs.  Purpose of Informants  Drug informants are used most frequently for the following reasons:  To gather information from sources not readily available to law enforcement officers. Police have long depended on informants to provide them with information they would never otherwise receive. Because of the clandestine nature of the drug world, specific information about upcoming drug transactions, where drugs are being manufactured, and how they are transported is only known by those involved in the crime. Informants within drug organizations play a vital role in obtaining this needed information for law enforcement.  To make observations in places where strangers would immediately be suspect. Many drug investigations require that surveillance operations be conducted within communities that are suspicious of strangers. Using informants who are accepted within these communities will lower the level of suspicion that a police operation is underway, and makes criminals operating in the area feel more comfortable. Unfamiliar faces in an area may raise suspicions that might force them to go deeper underground or change their modus operandi.  To conduct undercover negotiations. Since drug dealers realize that a common drug law enforcement investigative technique is to infiltrate their organization with undercover agents, they frequently will not interact with strangers. Many dealers build up their businesses by not dealing with strangers, and they are not willing to take a risk with a new person, regardless of what he or she may have to offer. With proper direction and guidance, informants can take the place of an undercover drug agent in negotiating the purchase of drugs from a targeted drug dealer. When doing so, the drug agent should electronically record the conversation to corroborate exactly what the informant told the dealer, and what the dealer told the informant. Informants may be reliable in many cases, but they are not infallible. A recording device will capture all that was said, and nothing will be lost through faulty memory. A tape recording of the informantâs conversation with the drug dealer will also keep him honest.  To gain firsthand, timely intelligence. Since informants have the ability to interact with criminals in both professional and social settings, they are in an excellent position to obtain information about crimes that have occurred or are about to occur. Police must still corroborate the informantâs information before any action is taken. Timely intelligence information provided by informants may later be the basis for search warrant affidavits, arrest warrants, or seizure warrants for drug proceeds, property, or money.  Motivational Factors Like many people, informants need motivation to produce. The more motivated they are, the more likely they are to apply themselves to the task at hand and remain committed to achieving success. Identifying an informantâs true motives for providing drug agents with information increases the chances of conducting an effective and safe drug operation. If a drug agent believes that the informant is providing information because he is repentant for past crimes, when in actuality he is there to learn police intelligence and their methods of operation in order to avoid detection himself, a disaster is in the making.  Informants commonly voice a specific motive for providing information, however as the case progresses, other more compelling reasons may surface. Some of the more common motivational factors encountered by drug agents are fear, revenge, money, repentance, and sometimes altruism. However, often times an individualâs ego and compulsion to play a role in something important and exciting drives the individual to become an informant.  Walk-In/Call-In Informants Drug agents need to be good listeners and carefully evaluate a first time informantâs information being offered over the telephone. Someone who visits the drug agentâs office offering information must be scrutinized for what is motivating him or her to take this initial step. A thorough interview will often reveal clues as to what is motivating this person to come forward. Their information cannot be discounted simply because the person is not willing to meet with a drug agent in person. Drug agents should obtain identifying information and a callback telephone number whenever possible. The informant should be encouraged to submit to a face-to-face meeting if the informantâs information appears actionable.  Fear The most frequent motivation leading someone to provide information is the fear of going to prison. Fear is a strong motivator when someone has just been arrested and faces the probability of years of imprisonment for committing drug crimes.  Drug agents will attempt to convince a newly arrested suspect to immediately provide information leading to other arrests in the ongoing investigation. Drug agents must convince the potential informant that this may be his only opportunity to help himself in his pending legal matter. The agent must never promise a reduced sentence or other consideration, but can assure the person that his cooperation will be made known to the prosecutor and the court at a future date. He should know that his lack of cooperation will also be brought to the attention of the prosecutor and court.  A typical scenario may be this: a suspect has agreed to deliver a quantity of drugs to an undercover drug agent. Upon delivering the drugs, the suspect is arrested and taken into custody. Drug agents will frequently question the suspect at the scene of the arrest, and solicit his cooperation in helping them immediately expand their investigation. They will ask the arrested person who his drug source of supply is and where more drugs are located.  Drug agents know that fear will often motivate a suspect to cooperate in the investigation once he realizes how much punishment he is likely to receive if convicted of the crime, especially if the person has prior drug arrests (see Chapter 10). This fear tactic may induce him to make a recorded telephone call to his drug source in the hopes of getting him to acknowledge furnishing the drugs, thereby making him also subject to indictment.  Depending on the particular circumstances, drug agents may ask the arrested person to immediately telephone his source to set up a meeting on the pretense of paying for the drugs just delivered, or to deliver more drugs for another sale. If the drug agents are successful in luring the source of supply out in the open and can arrest him, they will attempt to convince him to also cooperate. The technique of convincing a person to cooperate against co-conspirators is commonly known as flipping the suspect.  It should be noted that once it becomes public knowledge that someone has been arrested on drug charges, other members of the conspiracy often assume the suspect is cooperating with drug agents and may identify other members of the conspiracy. Because of this assumption, co-conspirators will usually avoid the arrested suspect and cut off all forms of communication with him for fear he is setting them up to be arrested. Swift action must be taken by drug agents to seize the opportunity before other co-conspirators realize what has happened. Defendant-informants, however, may still be valuable in testifying against other members of the conspiracy in return for legal consideration.  Informants may also be motivated to cooperate with drug agents to protect them from their criminal associates. Some may think that by having their criminal associates arrested, they will protect themselves from retribution and will not have to pay for any drugs their source of supply advanced or fronted them on consignment.  Fear in the mind of a drug dealer can also stem from a member of a drug conspiracy falsely accusing him of being an informant and cooperating with the police. In order to seek self-preservation, money, or both, they will often become informants.  Revenge and Jealousy Both revenge and jealousy have historically motivated people to do things they might not normally do. Jealousy may stem from love or money, but business disputes between competing drug criminal organizations may prompt revenge.  Drug agents should be wary of informants who seek to eliminate their own drug dealing competition. Nothing prevents a drug agent from using this information to target the competing drug dealer. However, once the competitor is arrested, the drug agent should solicit his help in eliminating the informantâs drug enterprise as well.  Repentance Informants often claim they are repentant for past crimes, but this is rarely the case. Expressions of repentance are sometimes used to convince the drug agent he or she is now a good person and wants to make amends for past deeds. However, this is seldom their only motive for cooperating. When drug agents encounter an informant who claims repentance as their sole reason for providing information, they must be cautious of hidden and sometimes devious motivational factors.  Altruism Some individuals are motivated by a sense of self-sacrifice. People with professional obligations or feelings of responsibility frequently provide information to the police. Examples of altruistic informants include airline employees when they see something suspicious about a passenger or his baggage, or express delivery service employees who detect drugs in packages they are delivering. These informants are rarely involved in criminal activity, and their usefulness is limited.  Mercenaries Some individuals provide information or services simply for money. These money-motivated informants, known as mercenaries, are usually the most willing to follow a drug agentâs direction. They frequently have a history of criminal activity prior to their relationship with law enforcement. This familiarization with crime and criminals make them a valuable asset for drug agents who must rely on them to make frequent and personal contacts with drug traffickers to glean criminal intelligence. They often serve as a means of introducing an undercover drug agent to drug dealers on the pretense of being a buyer of narcotics or someone who can provide a specific service in the drug trade such as a transportation specialist or money launderer.  Money-motivated informants are expected to accompany the targeted drug dealer alone for much longer periods of time than would be practical for an undercover drug agent. Drug agents should be aware that they frequently possess other motives besides remuneration that must be explored. They are professionals deserving of respect and appropriate compensation if agents want them to continue providing information in the future. Payments to informants will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.  Egotism These commonly encountered informants often have low self-esteem and may not have received positive reinforcement from their parents, authority figures, or peers when growing up. Consequently, as adults they seek positive reinforcement wherever they can get it and sometimes rely on anticipated positive feedback from their handlers for doing a good job. Drug agents who provide egotistical informants positive reinforcement motivate them to continue supplying quality information. Unfortunately, these informants are often the hardest to handle because their egos prevent them from relinquishing control of the investigation to their handlers.  Egotistical informants wish to have an aggressive role in the undercover investigation in order to justify as much praise or money as possible. They will sometimes prolong an investigation unnecessarily in order to justify more money or praise. They are quick to remind their handling agent that if it were not for them, the case would never have happened. An informant in this category may demand payment for services rendered, but in reality, the praise he expects to receive from authority figures is the primary motivator for him becoming and staying an informant.  Drug agents who recognize egotistical informants for what they are should heap the praise he desperately seeks. To deny these informants praise could jeopardize future working relationships with him and may drive him to work with another drug agent or go to an entirely different agency to offer his services. The ego of the informant should not be in competition with the ego of the handling agent.  James Bond Syndrome Some drug informants see their role as an opportunity to have their life imitate art. While working as informants they imagine themselves in a particular police or spy drama. Sometimes they will even orchestrate events to parallel a scene from a movie or chapter of a novel. Being especially hard to handle, these informants often exaggerate their knowledge of drug activity to enhance the likelihood of becoming an informant so they can play the role of their life. When an informant insists that an undercover operation be conducted in a particular or peculiar way or demands that he be issued a weapon, identification, or fancy vehicle, these are indicators he may be more interested in his role than the objective of the investigation.  These informants are rarely motivated to work for the police to make amends for past criminal activity, but rather give their motive for becoming an informant as something as noble as wanting to help win the war on drugs. Drug agents are advised to handle this type of informant carefully. Although the information they provide may be credible and easily verifiable, the informant cannot be allowed to take control of the investigation and dictate how it will be conducted. To do so wastes valuable time and resources while the informant plays out his fantasies. The informantâs insistence on how to carry out a particular phase of the case may raise unnecessary safety concerns for drug agents and the informant alike. The informantâs handler must control him by making it clear that although his suggestions will be seriously considered, the agent is the decision maker and his or her supervisor is the final authority on how the investigation will be conducted.  The Wannabe Wannabe informants are usually people that from a very young age, wanted to become a law enforcement officer. For whatever reason though they did not qualify, either because of physical or psychological defects, and believe that becoming an informant is the only way left for them to fulfill their lifeâs desire. Because they usually lack criminal associates, these individuals usually cannot provide specific information about drug traffickers, and thus do not make good informants.  Indicators that the drug agents may be dealing with a wannabe are when the prospective informant asks to see what the drug agentâs badge and identification card look like or asks what the likelihood of him becoming a sworn officer is. Drug agents who use wannabe informants run the risk of the informant purposely implying to third parties they are actually police officers. These informants also have a tendency to reveal their role to unconcerned parties, implying they have some sort of governmental authority, which they do not.  Perversely Motivated Informants Perhaps the most dangerous and disruptive person a drug agent will encounter in drug law enforcement is a perversely motivated informant. They offer their services to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of identifying undercover agents, learning the departmentâs methods, targets, and intelligence, or eliminating their own competition in the drug business. Sometimes criminal organizations, especially outlaw motorcycle gangs, instruct these individuals to infiltrate departments as informants and employees to learn whatever they can to assist the traffickers. These individuals may even provide genuine information about a specific event as a decoy to divert resources from a much more significant trafficking activity elsewhere.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","198","2013-10-10T06:53:45","[Intel] DEA Confidential Informants","Discussion/Security","The Informant File Investigators should formally establish files on CIs who regularly provide information or expect compensation for information they supply. Informant files chronicle their work performance, background data, and personal history. Investigators should not use any CI that has not been documented.  Although drug agents should document every contact with informants, not everyone in the department has a need to know an informantâs identity or have access to informant files. Access should be on a strictly need-to-know basis, including only those drug agents and their supervisors who deal directly with the informant.  To further protect the CIâs identity, investigators should use code numbers in lieu of his name in all investigative reports. Informants should keep the same number throughout their working relationship with the department.  The informant file should include information pertaining to the informantâs vital statistics. Information such as his photograph and fingerprints, physical description, work and home addresses, vehicles driven, contact telephone numbers, including cellular, home, business, fax, pager, and email address. Also next of kin information needs to be documented to help find the informant if he should later be wanted for a crime.  Equally important are periodic checks through the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) for any wants or warrants for the informant. Also needed are FBI and state police rap sheets reflecting past arrests and convictions. This information needs to be consistently updated and documented in the file. A wanted informant should never be used, and any drug agent who knowingly uses an informant who is a fugitive from justice should be severely censored. The likelihood of any case being prosecuted that was developed by a fugitive informant is remote at best.  Taking a CIâs photograph and fingerprints, and other documentation sends a clear message to the informant that he should be straightforward and honest with his handlers. The informant will also realize that he is dealing with professionals who leave nothing to chance. He will know drug agents have sufficient personal information about him to enable them to find him quickly if he should ever commit a crime or maliciously expose information about undercover agents and police operations. Such documentation may deter perversely motivated informants.  In addition, informant files enhance the credibility of the department in the eyes of the court and the public who view informants as inherently unreliable. Every time the informant provides information concerning an actual or potential criminal event, the agency should create a written report detailing this information in the file.  The department must also document what steps it takes to corroborate information provided by the informant. This is especially important when informants act unilaterally. As a matter of policy, all informant information should be verified regardless of the informantâs past reliability.  Informant Debriefings Before drug agents initiate an investigation based on information received from an informant, the designated handler should debrief the informant in order to ascertain his motive or motives and to advise him about the departmentâs rules and regulations concerning the management of informants. For example, informants should know that they carry no official status with the department, that the department will not tolerate their breaking the law or entrapping suspects in any investigation, and that the department cannot guarantee that they will not be called as witnesses in court.  At the end of the initial debriefing, the drug agent should document this information in an informant agreement. This agreement should be signed by the informant, witnessed by the handler and supervisor, and placed in the informantâs newly created permanent informant file. Investigators should debrief their informants on a regular basis, usually every 30, 60, or 90 days, to show they are active, or if necessary, to terminate their association with the department due to lack of productivity.  Agent-Informant Contact Procedures The department must establish drug agent-informant contact procedures, and train employees in their use. For instance, the handler should meet with the informant in private and always in the presence of another drug agent or sworn police officer. The department should either strongly discourage or prohibit drug agents from contacting informants alone, especially if the drug agent intends to pay the informant. Meeting or paying an informant alone leaves the drug agent and the department vulnerable to allegations of wrongdoing.  Although informant handlers often develop special working relationships with their informants, department policies should preclude drug agents from contacting their informants outside the scope of official business. Drug agents must keep their relationships with informants strictly professional. This is particularly important when the informant and the drug agent are not of the same sex. Policies should also expressly prohibit socializing with informants and their families, becoming romantically involved with them, having off-duty business relationships with them, and accepting informantâs gifts or gratuities.  To ensure adherence to department policy, supervisors should review informant files regularly. In addition, they need to attend debriefings periodically to oversee the entire informant management process.  Finally, department managers must establish procedures for investigating alleged policy violations by drug agents or informants. Thorough investigations of this type maintain the integrity of the department by dispelling any notion that the department does not enforce its own policies.  Informant Payments Informant payments can be divided into two distinct categories: awards and rewards.  Monetary awards are often based on a percentage of the net value of a drug dealerâs assets seized during an investigation as a result of informantâs information. Advising the informant what percentage he can expect to receive at the beginning of the case provides an incentive for the informant to seek out hidden assets that might otherwise go undetected.  Rewards, on the other hand, do not represent a percentage of the value of the seized assets. Rewards are specific amounts of money usually determined by the type and quantity of drugs seized. Other determining factors include the overall quality of the case, his level of cooperation, the number of defendants indited and convicted, the amount of time and effort expended, and level of danger the informant was exposed to during the course of the investigation. Unlike awards, rewards come directly from the agencyâs budget. Informants should be eligible for both awards and rewards.  While an informant may receive money as a reward, many cooperate with law enforcement agencies to receive a reduced sentence for a pending criminal matter. Regardless of the form of compensation the informant receives, police departments must have a policy addressing under what circumstances an informant qualifies for an award or reward, who can authorize such payments, and under what conditions payments will be granted.  A defendant-informant should only be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred during the investigation. His reward is judicial consideration for his cooperation. Once the informant works off his legal situation, drug agents should continue to use him with the promise of awards and rewards in future investigations.  Although many informants can receive substantial awards by locating the assets of drug dealers, agency policy and budget restraints may limit the dollar amount informants receive. For this reason, investigators should exercise caution when explaining the payment policy to informants. They should never mention a specific dollar amount the informant will receive. Otherwise, the informant will hold the department to that amount, regardless of future budgetary constraints. Departments should never pay informants based solely on the amount of drugs they recover. Informants have been known to tell dealers to add adulterants to their drugs that are about to be seized as a way of justifying a larger money reward.  In addition to providing awards and rewards, departments should reimburse informants for expenses incurred during an investigation. The department may wish to round up the reimbursement the informant is entitled to as an added incentive to continue working.  It is highly recommended that informants be paid only in the presence of witnesses, with the final payment being made only after all court proceedings have been completed to ensure the informantâs presence at the trial. Every time an informant payment is made, a record documenting the date, exact amount, and who made and witnessed the payment must be included in the informantâs file in anticipation of future court inquiries.  How to Make a Controlled Purchase Using an Informant An investigative technique known as a controlled purchase, or a controlled buy, is frequently used in modern drug enforcement operations. By definition, a controlled purchase is when an informant or undercover drug agent buys drugs or other contraband from a suspect in order to use it as evidence in trial. The first sale of the contraband itself is a crime the suspect can be arrested for, but usually several purchases are made within several days or weeks, in progressively larger amounts, in order to defeat the entrapment defense. Entrapment is a legal defense where the defendant claims that either the informant or police convinced him to commit a crime he would not otherwise be predisposed to commit, solely for the purpose of arresting him. In other words, the defendant claims the police planted the idea of him committing the crime. By making several controlled buys, additional physical evidence is obtained, and the prosecution can dispel any notion that they entrapped the defendant.  CIs are frequently used to make controlled purchases of drugs, stolen property, weapons, and other contraband when using an undercover police officer would be impractical. Generally, informants provide law enforcement with the initial information pertaining to the illegal activities of the suspect. In a typical drug case scenario, investigators will first conduct a thorough debriefing of the informant that will most likely reveal that the informant has bought drugs or other contraband from the suspect in the past. The drug agents will determine if the suspect will continue to deal with the informant. If he will, an undercover meeting is planned.  Drug agents may learn the suspect refuses to take on new customers for fear they may be undercover police officers. Using a drug agent should be the first choice in investigating this type of case, but in light of his refusal to meet new customers, investigators may have to rely on the CI to make these controlled purchases instead.  The objective of the controlled buy investigative technique is to be able to prove in court that the suspect sold drugs to the informant. This is accomplished by taking precautions to lessen, if not eliminate, any other possibility. Below is the step-by-step procedure that should be followed to enhance the  informantâs safety during the operation, and to convince a reasonable man that the informant could only have obtained the drugs from the defendant.  Thoroughly Debrief the Informant Drug agents must conduct a thorough debriefing of the informant in order to ascertain all known facts about the suspect. Questions the informant must answer include:  1. What is the physical description of the suspect? Where does he live and work? What are his contact telephone numbers? What type of vehicle does he drive?  2. Does the suspect have a propensity towards violence? Does he have access to a weapon?  3. How does the informant know the suspect? How long have they known each other?  4. Who is the source of supply (SOS) for the suspectâs drugs? Does he have more than one SOS? What other items of contraband does he deal in? Is he a poly-drug dealer or does he specialize in one particular drug? When was the last time the informant saw the suspect deal drugs?  5. What is the price for the drugs he is selling? Are the prices reasonable, or exceptionally high or low for the area? (A low price could be indicative of either a planned robbery, or the sale of counterfeit drugs.)  6. Will the suspect meet new customers? Is he part of a larger organization needing assistance, e.g., couriers, enforcers, transporters, money launderers? Can an undercover agent be introduced to fill one of the organizationâs needs?  7. Where does he deal his drugs? What quantities does he deal in? Where does he like to make the exchange of drugs for money?  8. Does he deal alone or with others? Does he use counter-surveillance during his drug deals? If so, what do these people look like? What are their names, addresses, work places, vehicles they drive, etc?",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","198","2013-10-10T06:52:47","[Intel] DEA Confidential Informants","Discussion/Security","Drug agents must constantly guard against providing more information to informants than the informants are providing to them. The information informantâs gain from law enforcement agencies about their personnel, undercover vehicles, tactics, equipment, and particularly targets, is a valuable commodity that can be sold to traffickers or traded for drugs. These informants may also be seeking information to help in their own drug dealings in the future. (lulz!)  Drug agents should always minimize the exposure of undercover officers, their vehicles, and other informants to all informants in order to minimize damage to their operations in case they are working for drug traffickers or intend to do so. Criminals may threaten some informants or their families if they do not provide them with details on what information the police have concerning their drug trafficking activities.  Drug agents must question all walk-in and call-in informants, e.g., individuals who volunteer their services without prompting, because they may be, or have the potential of becoming perversely motivated. These potential informants should be told that their backgrounds will be thoroughly investigated, and that their fingerprints and photograph will be maintained in a file that will be established. Knowing that their backgrounds will be investigated may be enough to sway a potential informant from carrying out his perverse mission. Merely asking an informant to submit to a polygraph examination in order to substantiate his claims that he is not working for drug traffickers will often reveal his perverse activities.  Restricted-Use Informants Some informants, by virtue of their extensive criminal backgrounds or status, pose special management challenges to both drug agents and supervisors. Drug unit supervisors should carefully scrutinize these individuals prior to using them as informants. Examples include juveniles, individuals on pro- bation or parole, individuals currently or formerly addicted to drugs, felons with multiple convictions, and individuals known to be previously unreliable.  Drug agents should not use these individuals as informants without supervisory approval. Because these informants require special scrutiny and rigorous handling, only senior investigators should be assigned to manage them. Drug agents must constantly reevaluate the motives of these individuals.  Informants known to be previously unreliable should not be used except in the most extraordinary circumstances. They have shown, through their past actions, that they cannot be trusted or relied on to follow the directions of their handler. They will often exaggerate their knowledge of drug activity in order to regain their informant status, which in itself is a reason to question their use.  Developing Confidential Informants Every person a drug agent comes into contact with is a potential informant. As stated earlier, the most common pool of informants are criminals recently arrested that want to work off their legal dilemma. Informants are often shared by police agencies. Sometimes when an informant has specific information about a crime that cannot be investigated by his handlerâs agency, the handler will turn the informant over to the appropriate law enforcement agency to conduct the investigation. An example would be an informant for the U.S. Secret Service who comes across drug information that the DEA would be interested in.  Drug agents can also locate informants by reviewing closed drug investigative files and contacting persons involved in the case who are either now in prison or were somehow affected. Sometimes these people, especially those incarcerated, will either seek revenge or provide information to enhance their chances of parole. Even though they are in prison, they can make telephone introductions to dealers for undercover investigators so that they can discuss future drug transactions.  Sometimes targets of opportunity arise for the drug investigator. If a targeted drug dealer harms someoneâs spouse, parent, significant other, or business partner, the drug agent should visit the victim to solicit their help in the investigation. The injured party may use the drug agent as the means of seeking revenge and punishing the dealer for harming them.  Supervisorâs Role in Informant Management Police agencies should not leave the management of drug informants exclusively to nonsupervisory drug agents. Formulating a written policy, approved by the agency head, ensures consistency in the use and management of informants and serves as a guide for inexperienced investigators.  The informant policy should indicate which investigators may maintain informants as well as who will supervise them. In addition, the policy should clearly establish that informants are assets of the entire department and not the individual agent/handler. In this regard, management should both authorize and encourage investigators to share informants with others within the department. Also, checks and balances must be in place to ensure that the policy is followed. Violations of the policy can leave the department vulnerable to severe criticism from the public and prompt lawsuits by persons affected by the informantâs information.  Policy concerning the management of CIs should establish procedures in several areas. These include creating and documenting informant files, debriefing and interacting with informants, and determining methods and amounts of payments for services rendered.  Protecting the Informantâs Identity Society has always been negative toward informants. âTattletalesâ and others who provide information to authorities have always been looked down on. The number one concern of informants is the protection of their identities. Generally in drug investigations, a guarantee that the identity of the informant will never be revealed cannot be made. In fact, due to the nature of these investigations, there is much more likelihood that the informantâs identity will be revealed than not, and that he will possibly be later called to testify in court. This is because of the intense personal involvement of the informant with the suspect during the course of the investigation. Everything he sees, hears, or does is subject to cross-examination by a defense attorney.  Avoid Making the Informant a Percipient Witness There are methods, however, that can help prevent the identity of the informant from being revealed. One such method is not exposing the informant to actions that make him a percipient witness to the event. Another is to conceal exactly when the informant provided information to the police.  As an example, an informant notifies the police that open drug sales are being conducted at a given location. Drug agents establish surveillance at the location, and from their experience and training conclude that in all likelihood, drugs are being sold at this location. The surveillance lasts for one week. In the middle of the week, the informant is sent into the location to make a controlled purchase of drugs to establish that controlled substances are, in fact, being sold at the location. Surveillance continues for several more days until an affidavit for a search warrant is presented to a judge who grants the police authority to search the premises, based partly on the actions of the informant. The affidavit may not have to be specific as to when the informant made the drug purchase. Since numerous drug sales most likely will continue up to the moment the search warrant is executed on the premises, it would be impossible for the traffickers to know, with certainty, who informed the police. To further protect the informant, an agreement should be made ahead of time with the prosecutor not to file charges against the defendants for the controlled purchase of drugs made by the informant. This will help guarantee his identity will not be revealed to the suspect or the public in general.  Report-Writing Techniques Another way to minimize the informantâs exposure is to not reveal his name in police investigative reports. These reports can be written in a way to conceal the gender of the informant by substituting a number for his or her name. Be mindful that even though the name of the informant may not be in the police report, the drug trafficker will most likely remember who was involved in the activities revealed in the police report. It may become obvious to the trafficker who the informant is, however, no one outside the investigation will know who was involved.  Using the Informant to Introduce Undercover Agents Informants must be percipient witnesses to events in order to be called to testify in court. If an informant is used solely to introduce an undercover agent to the targeted drug trafficker and has no further involvement, the likelihood of the informant being identified by being called to testify in court is diminished greatly. If the informant is later confronted by the trafficker and accused of being an informant, he can provide a plausible story denying he knew the person he introduced to the trafficker was a drug agent.  Wall-Off Method Another highly successful method of concealing the identity of the informant is using a technique known as a wall-off. Here an informant is ready to consummate a drug deal with the suspect. This drug deal is likely to be the third in a series of confidence buys where the suspect was allowed to leave with the buy money, giving him no reason to suspect the informant was involved with the police. During a final meeting, the informant may display money to the trafficker to prove he can purchase additional drugs.  The trafficker departs the meeting with the intent of returning with the drugs at a given time to deliver them to the informant. After retrieving the drugs, but before arriving back at the original meeting spot, drug agents arrange for a marked police car to follow the trafficker until the uniformed police officers can develop independent probable cause to stop the vehicle, which is usually a minor traffic offense.  The officers may either see the drugs in plain view, or ask the driver/drug trafficker for permission to search the car. Many suspects grant permission for the search feeling they have hidden the drugs well enough that they cannot be found. The search is conducted and after the drugs are found, the suspect is arrested.  If the dealer later makes bail, the CI will be instructed to telephone the trafficker. To reinforce in the traffickerâs mind the informant had no prior knowledge of his arrest, he will ask the trafficker why he never returned to the delivery point with the drugs. If the trafficker admits to being arrested, the informant can suggest they stay away from each other since law enforcement must be investigating him. The informant can also feign anger at dealing with someone that the police were interested in, and state how lucky he was to have escaped arrest. Also, the informant can ask the trafficker if he mentioned he was going to deliver the drugs to him, and if he gave the police any information about the CI.  This charade has been highly effective in keeping drug informantâs identities confidential. To further conceal the identity of the informant, drug agents can arrange with the prosecutor not to prosecute any prior controlled purchases between the informant and the trafficker in order to minimize the likelihood of the informant being exposed.  By using these methods, drug agents will successfully build a wall that will hopefully prevent the drug trafficker from discovering who the CI is. This wall-off technique also works well in concealing the involvement of an entire law enforcement agency. One agency may ask another to stop and conduct a search of a drug traffickerâs vehicle in order to disguise its involvement.  Camouflage Techniques In order to camouflage the relationship between the informant and the police, several techniques can be used. At the time the suspect is arrested, the informant can also be handcuffed and âarrested,â reinforcing the notion he is not an informant. The informant can be initially lodged in the same jail cell with the drug dealer immediately after the arrest and allowed to wear a transmitter to record their conversations about other suspects, drug hiding places, and the like.  Another method is when the trafficker delivers drugs to the informant and he âescapesâ without the drugs followed by drug agents in hot pursuit. Later the pursuing agents return to the arrest scene and question the suspect about the identity of the person who fled thereby giving him the impression that they have no idea who the person is or that he is an informant.  Other Considerations Drug agents should refrain from providing their informants with their department business cards. Providing them with business cards shows that a relationship exists between the drug agent and the informant. There is also a possibility that targeted drug dealers will inadvertently see the card and accuse him of being an informant. Any connection drug traffickers can establish between the informant and law enforcement will jeopardize the ongoing investigation, and possibly create safety problems for both the drug agents and the informant.  Another good reason not to provide an informant with a business card is to eliminate the possibility of the informant posing as a drug agent. Informants have been known to pose as police and seize drugs from unsuspecting drug dealers to later sell. Producing an authentic police business card may facilitate this or other crimes. This also prevents the informant from posing as a drug agent in social situations.  To further protect the identity of the informant, drug agents should provide an informant with the investigatorâs telephone contact numbers on a plain piece of paper in the informantâs own handwriting. The numbers can be arranged in such a way to resemble a mathematical problem, where the numbers in the equation make up the office or pager number of the handler (Figure 4.1).    Figure 4.1 Example of disguising telephone number (202) 555â1212.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","198","2013-10-10T06:54:26","[Intel] DEA Confidential Informants","Discussion/Security","Check Law Enforcement Indices Once this preliminary information is obtained, a thorough check of various law enforcement and public records should be made. The FBIâs NCIC can quickly determine if the suspect is wanted, has ever been arrested, what he was arrested for, and if he has ever been in prison.  If the suspect has been arrested, a review of the arrest report may reveal known associates, if he was armed, methods of operation, vehicles driven at the time of the arrest, etc. all of which are helpful in the beginning stages of a drug investigation. If a check reveals the suspect has a warrant for his arrest, it may make more sense to abandon the drug deal in favor of arresting him for the warrant instead. There is also a chance the suspect could be arrested by another police agency for the warrant prior to the completion of the drug investigation.  Checking with the stateâs Department of Motor Vehicles will identify all vehicles registered to the suspect, what mailing addresses he uses, as well as his driving record and photograph from his driverâs license.  Requesting information from the local utility and telephone companies will reveal what locations he pays for gas and electric service as well as long distance telephone numbers he calls. Cellular telephone companies can provide credit information used to secure the service, as well as billing addresses, and a listing of all telephone numbers dialed from that instrument. From an analysis of telephone numbers he calls, the drug agents may be able to show connections between the suspect and other known or suspected drug dealers.  Monitor Phone Calls and Personal Visits between the Informant and the Suspect To further corroborate the informantâs information, monitor and record all telephone conversations between the informant and the suspect. It should be noted that in most states, conversations recorded with the consent of at least one involved party do not require a warrant. However, because consensual eavesdropping rules vary from state to state, agents not employed by the federal government should consult with their state attorneyâs office before using this technique.  The objective of these initial phone calls is to schedule a face-to-face meeting between the informant and the drug dealer. Monitoring these conversations accomplish several important things: it corroborates that the informant personally knows the suspect, it shows the informant that the drug agents are thorough in their methods, and it makes it clear that they intend to verify unsubstantiated information.  Before a telephone call is made to set up a face-to-face meeting, the drug agents should have an investigative plan that includes the clear objectives of the investigation, including where the meeting will take place. The selection of the location of the meeting should be made in advance to insure the location is conducive to easy surveillance.  The objectives of the investigation may change depending on the development of the case. The suspect may reveal to the informant a location where drugs are being stashed, or may ask him to assist in a future drug transaction. By monitoring all contacts between the informant and the suspect, the drug agents know all the unfiltered information the informant has about the suspect. It also prevents the informant from secretly taking part in an unauthorized side deal with the suspect.  Provide the Informant with Official Funds That Have the Serial Numbers Recorded Just before leaving the office to follow the informant to the meeting location, drug agents should provide him with the monies necessary to purchase the drugs in question. In order to document how much money investigators gave to the informant, a signed receipt for the money must be obtained and included in the case file. Any monies not spent to purchase evidence must immediately be returned. Serialization of the money is important for three reasons: (1) It clearly demonstrates that the money originated from law enforcement, (2) it discourages the informant from stealing it, and (3) in the event the serialized money is seized from the suspect at a later date, it further corroborates he received the money from the informant. These funds may later be recovered at the time of the suspectâs arrest or during the execution of a search warrant at the suspectâs home, business, or vehicle.  The physical appearance of the money to be given to the suspect is important. Freshly printed notes banded in a wrapper provided by the Federal Reserve Bank, may alert the suspect that he is dealing with government authorities. However, used bills, in a variety of denominations, secured by rubber bands, will help convince the suspect that he is dealing with another drug dealer, because these are the types of bills drug dealers usually encounter (see Chapter  .  Wire the Informant for Sound Make sure the device used to transmit and record the informantâs conversations with the suspect is operational before leaving the office. The informant must be cautioned not to turn off the transmitter under any circumstances since this will leave the investigation open to criticism and the issue will likely be raised in future court proceedings. Informants must be made to understand that if the transmitter is switched off the suspect may allege in court that while it was off, the informant threatened him harm if he did not go through with the drug deal. To avoid this situation, drug agents should attempt to only use transmitters that cannot be turned off, intentionally or accidentally.  Another rule of thumb about recording and transmitting devices is that if drug agents decide to record the first meeting, they should be prepared to record all subsequent meetings and telephone calls between the informant and the suspect during the entire investigation. By selectively recording only certain conversations, questions will be raised about the integrity of the case, and this may dampen the enthusiasm of the prosecutor to file charges against the suspect.  Designate Verbal and Visual Distress and Arrest Signals Drug agents must discuss with the informant what signals to give in the eventhe is in trouble or he is being robbed of the agencyâs money. Both verbal andvisual signals are needed since the transmitter cannot be relied upon. Theinformant must be trained that in the event of a transmitter failure, he shouldprovide previously agreed upon visual signals designating distress or whendrug agents should make their arrest. Telephonic pagers greatly assist the drug agent in discretely communicating with the informant. Sending the informant a certain code number may mean to wrap up his conversation and leave the area. Another code may indicate surveillance is following him. Cellular telephones are also extremely useful in giving direction to the informant, provided the suspect cannot overhear the conversation, and the informant does not say something that would identify the caller.  Search the Informant and His Vehicle Before leaving the office to go to the meeting location, it is vital that drug agents thoroughly search both the informant and his vehicle. This allows the drug agent to testify he did not find any drugs, weapons, or other contraband in the informantâs immediate possession that could be used to either frame the suspect, or coerce him into selling drugs. If the informant refuses to allow himself or his vehicle to be searched, halt the operation immediately, and do not proceed until it can be established why the informant refuses to follow direction.  Surveillance Team to Follow the Informant The surveillance team follows the informant to the predetermined meeting place so drug agents can later testify that the informant did not leave their sight and have an opportunity to pick up drugs or weapons at another location. Upon arrival at the meet location, drug agents should set up surveillance of the location to not only determine if the suspect has arrived, but when he arrives, and to also protect the informant from the suspect.  If the meeting place is at a public location such as a resturant, placing a drug agent inside to pose as a customer will further corroborate the informantâs statements and will reveal if anyone joined the suspect during the conversation. The inside surveillance agent may be able to detect persons acting as counter-surveillance for the suspect. (For more details on this, see Chapter 6.)  Informant Is to Go to a Designated Cold Spot after the Meeting Immediately upon completion of the meeting, the informant should go to a designated cold spot that is far enough away from the location to not be seen by the suspect.  There drug agents should retrieve the drug evidence that the informant just purchased, and they should also search the informant and his vehicle again to look for any other contraband the suspect may have given him. Informants have been known to receive more drugs than expected, and keep the excess amount for their own personal use or resale later.  Instruct the Informant to Immediately Return to the Office The informant should return to the drug agentâs office where he can be thoroughly debriefed on what transpired and to make a written statement detailing the events. Every time an informant makes a controlled buy, regardless of how many times he has done it before, these same procedures must be followed. If an undercover drug agent is making the controlled buy instead of an informant, there is a presumption of integrity that precludes the necessity to search him or her. However, because of officer safety concerns, he or she should always be under constant surveillance by a team designated to provide him with protection. (For more information on this, see Chapter 7.)  The Seven Steps to Successful Informant Management Identify potential informants. Recognize persons who may be potential informants. Drug agents will develop this skill with experience.  Recruit informants. Establish a rapport with the person and explain the departmentâs policy on awards and rewards in order to recruit a diversified stable of informants.  Document all contacts with informants. Document and maintain informant files to give a true picture of his work performance. Update files whenever changes occur.  Develop relationships. Know the limitations of individual informants, but do not accept anything less than their maximum effort.  Maintain relationships. Keep informants active by exposing them to situations that enhance, not limit or restrict, their ability to perform at their maximum potential.  Use informants to their fullest. Continue to use informants to keep them from losing interest. Encourage other drug agents to task these informants whenever possible.  Control informants. Manage informants successfully by controlling them. Drug agents cannot allow informants to run investigations, regardless of how insistent or assertive they become. Drug agents and their supervisors ultimately make the decisions during cases, and informants must be made to realize this.  Keys to Success in Informant Management Control Drug agents must learn to control their informants in order to keep a handle on their investigation. Informants need to know that the drug agent is in charge of the investigation, and their supervisor is the ultimate decision-maker and they are not. Keeping control of the informant will prevent him from making unauthorized contacts with the targeted drug dealer and keep him in focus. Drug agents who lose control of their informant will soon lose control of their investigation.  Honesty If the controlling drug agent is not honest with the informant, why should the informant be honest with the agent? For the sake of safety and maintaining control of the informant, the investigator must be honest with him. If the investigator exaggerates about the amount of money his agency will pay the informant for his services, the informant is probably not going to work for the agency again. He may become disgruntled to the point of not cooperating during trial preparation or courtroom testimony. Honesty is certainly the best policy when working with drug informants.  Fairness and Respect Informants, like anyone else, appreciate being treated fairly. Drug agents should consistently treat their informants fairly throughout their relationship, and they should be treated the same as any other employee.  Show respect for the informant and refrain from calling him names such as snitch, fink, rat, and the like. Chances are he would not be an informant if it were not out of necessity. Show your appreciation for his long hours and hard work on the job.  Clarity in Direction Many mistakes can be avoided when the drug agent takes the time to clearly explain directions to the informant. By being clear and specific with the informant, he cannot claim, rightly or wrongly, that he did not know he could not do a particular thing. Making mistakes due to misdirection or carelessness can cause tremendous safety problems for the informant and drug agents as well.  Provide Training for the Informant Informants must be trained in some legal aspects of drug enforcement to avoid violating a suspectâs rights and to prevent the informant from committing unintentional criminal acts. Unless trained, informants may believe they have law enforcement authority, when they do not; that they can carry concealed weapons, when they cannot; and that they can entrap people who normally would not be predisposed to commit a drug crime for the purpose of arresting them. All these areas as well as departmental policies concerning informant interaction must be gone over with the informant.  Informants must also be taught to know they cannot violate the law in an effort to enforce it. The informant must know that violations of the law will not be tolerated, and that he will be arrested for doing so. For instance, breaking into a drug dealerâs home to find evidence of a crime will result in the informantâs arrest and prosecution for burglary. The informant must be clear on what he is expected to do, and more importantly, what he shall not do.  Summary Since the public does not usually report drug crimes, it is imperative that drug agents collect a steady flow of actionable criminal intelligence in order for them to be effective. This requires the constant recruitment, use, and proper management of drug informants and their information. The purpose of informants is to gather information from sources not readily available to law enforcement officers; to make observations in places where strangers would immediately be suspect; to conduct undercover negotiations; and to gain firsthand, timely intelligence.  Most informants either still are, or once were a part of the drug underground, which gives them access to highly valuable criminal information. At the same time, this association with drug dealers makes them inherently unreliable due to their criminal pasts and desire for anonymity.  All informants provide information to the police in order to get something in return. Their motives range from being paid to playing the role of a fictional crime-fighter. Regardless of what motivates an informant to provide information, the drug agent must identify the true reasons early on. An informant who states he is being motivated by money when in reality is motivated by revenge, will ignore direction from his handler and orchestrate events that will fulfill his motivation. Perversely motivated informants are dangerous and destructive.  Informants need to be kept under tight control. They need to know who is in charge and that they are not. The case agent and his or her supervisor must make every decision on what direction the drug investigation will take, never the informant. The informantâs input should be solicited and carefully considered, but the drug agent and his or her supervisor ultimately decides how the investigation will be conducted. ",""

Remember the adage that a VPN is for privacy and Tor is for anonymity.  Privacy is breakable while anonymity is not.  But privacy is preferable to complete openness, and is also potentially unbreakable, though you wouldn't want to trust it to save you.  The place you are potentially incorrect is that a VPN might NOT protect you from the FreedomHosting exploit.  Just like Tor didn't protect the users from that exploit, a VPN might not either.  On a basic level a VPN and Tor do the same thing:  they both hide your IP while browsing.  Its just the extent and completeness of that hiding, including the number of parties that need to be compromised to break it, that differentiates a VPN from Tor.  The script that phoned home using the firefox javascript exploit was either able to direct its network calls outside the normal browser TCP/IP channel, thereby exposing the local machine's IP, or it was able to grab the local IP and transmit that back to the script's ""home"" through Tor.  I am not exactly sure which method it used, but either way it was able to discover and send the machine's internet IP back to its home.  That's an important point. There are at least two ways a networked system can divulge its IP -- either it makes a direct network call to a compromised machine (thereby exposing its IP because it must do so as part of the network call itself), or it makes an obfuscated call (through Tor, etc.) to that compromised machine PASSING THE LOCAL INTERNET IP AS THE PAYLOAD or body of the network call through the normal encrypted channel (Tor/VPN in our case).  In a non-technical sense this distinction doesn't really matter, but in our discussion of whether a VPN might keep you hidden from a FreedomHosting type of exploit it is everything.  The reason is that a script that can work around any proxies you have set up on your local network (Tor/VPN/whatever) won't be stopped from divulging your IP directly through the call itself, while a script that can discover your internet IP address can send that data through any channel you direct it and it will still divulge your IP.  Like I said, this shit is complicated.  My guess is the FreedomHosting exploit just did a simple ""phone home"" type call, and something like OpenVPN might very well have protected you from that exploit.  I can't really be sure because I haven't been able to find a thorough technical analysis of the exploit script, and because this stuff is crazily complex when you get down to the nitty gritty.  The upshot though, IMO, is that a VPN before Tor has plenty of uses, not least of which is it might very well protect you from a Freedom Hosting type exploit.  If you are going to use a VPN, use one that utilizes OpenVPN, not Ipsec, and especially not PPTP.","I don't see how using a VPN--->Tor creates a permanent entry guard. If you skipped the VPN and went straight to Tor via the ISP--->Tor, wouldn't your ISP then become your permanent entry guard? No. Because any time you connect to the Tor network, the very first connection you  make will almost always be different/random. On the other hand,When you set Tor--->VPN then you are in fact always making a permanent exit because the web server (website) you're connecting to will always see the VPN IP address...it will never change. So if you connect to Tor from the same place, whether home, coffee shop, or VPN, you are always connecting to the Tor network from the same IP address, but your first hop in the Tor network will always be different/random, but your last hop in the Tor network into clearweb will always be from a different IP address (unless you use a VPN after Tor).As others have pointed out, using a VPN before Tor serves a few purposes: it prevents your ISP from seeing that you are using Tor and thus logging your specific activity (sites visited) and it prevents an exploit from reaching through the Tor network to identify your home IP address...such as was the case during the freedom host takedown. Even if you don't trust your VPN (and you shouldn't), if you connect to the VPN before Tor, I don't see any possible way they could monitor your traffic. Tor traffic is encrypted. You can take some precautions by finding a VPN provider that is outside of the U.S. but never rely on that fact alone. The U.S. can still work with partners. However there are some non-U.S. VPNs that are taking more of an activist role so they can be more trusted than U.S. based VPNs that are subject to U.S. laws."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","merge","7279","2013-12-12T02:50:40","VPN & Tor combo question","Discussion/Security"," Talking about external positions (ISP) as entry guards is a misuse of accepted terminology. Entry guard is a term that always refers to internal positions (VPN/Tor Node). It isn't completely nonsensical to think of your ISP as an externally positioned entry guard, but it is a weird and not very useful use of the term and nobody in the anonymity community is going to say it is correct.     This depends entirely on the VPN, and in most cases it is thought that having access to your ISP is just as good as having access to your VPN in a VPN -> Tor configuration. In the leaked NSA slides they talked about having trouble combining internal and external SIGINT, but I don't think that anybody knows why they would have such trouble, or if their trouble is some inherent problem with internal/external or due to other reasons. It is widely thought that partial internal / partial external SIGINT is enough to perform correlation attacks. The main reason to use VPN -> Tor is to hide that you use Tor. Other benefits are that it could add another hop that might not log which could be advantageous from certain attacks, and it does act as a long term entry guard. It also prevents an attacker who is internal to Tor but who doesn't own your VPN node or have an external position from doing correlation attacks to deanonymize you without first compromising your VPN. In the majority of cases you should assume that your VPN will cooperate with the government. If you look at cyber crime cases you will see that there are far more examples of VPN providers working with the feds than there are examples of VPN's preventing the feds from deanonymizing people. There are a few cases where using a VPN helped somebody prevent the feds from tracing them though.     First of all, a VPN is just as vulnerable to plaintext interception (either internally by the VPN operator or externally by their ISP) as Tor is. The poor assumption is that the people running VPN's are honest whereas the good assumption is that not all people running Tor exit nodes are honest. In reality we have no idea if the VPN operator is honest or not, just as we have no idea if a specific Tor exit node is honest or not. Also, a VPN is likely to turn on its customers if pressured by law enforcement to do so. Also, nothing stops law enforcement from running VPN services as honeypots, just as nothing stops them from running Tor exit nodes as honeypots. The privacy people attribute to VPN exit traffic is based on trust of the VPN operator and hope that there isn't an external attacker, this is the same scenario as privacy applied to Tor exit nodes. However, a deeper analysis of the situation reveals that Tor is actually superior for privacy. If you exit through a compromised VPN then 100% of your exit traffic is compromised, if you exit through a compromised Tor exit node then your exit traffic is only compromised while you are using that exit node. It may be true that a randomly selected VPN is less likely to consistently engage in snooping on their customers exit traffic as compared to a Tor exit node, but once they get a court order that assumption proves to be a poor one. A VPN is putting your exit traffic privacy eggs in one nest, a nest that might be less likely to be compromised from the beginning but a nest that will almost certainly be compromised if it is used for anything illegal. Tor is spreading your exit traffic privacy over a great many quickly changing nests, some of them will be compromised almost certainly but they will only get small snippets of your traffic.   Also, it makes no sense to say privacy is breakable while anonymity is not. Privacy and anonymity are both usually breakable, although there are information theoretic systems that can go a long way toward protecting both (systems that are, when seen as isolated systems that are not part of a bigger scenario, impossible to break). In practice, usually privacy is easier to protect than anonymity.      The best method of protecting from the Freedom Hosting exploit would be via virtual and/or physical isolation. That said, a VPN in a standard configuration (vpn -> Tor) would have prevented that specific attack from obtaining the real IP addresses of those who fell victim to it, although the attacker would have learned their VPN's IP address as well as their MAC address. The difference in this case is that Tor only routes application traffic if the application is somehow configured to use Tor, whereas a VPN in its standard configuration will seamlessly route all traffic through it. The FH exploit obtained IP addresses by placing in memory and executing a program that sent traffic around Tor, with a VPN all traffic is seamlessly routed over the VPN so that specific attack would have phoned home through the VPN, even though the attack program itself wasn't configured to use the VPN.    It sent traffic to an FBI server and since it wasn't configured to use Tor this resulted in the FBI server enumerating the IP addresses of infected computers. The reason Tor and a VPN are different in their ability to protect from this sort of attack is because they operate on different levels of the OSI model, Tor in its standard configuration requires applications to be torified, whereas a VPN in its standard configuration seamlessly routes all traffic over it.    Certainly they could have made a payload that would have deanonymized VPN users as well, but they didn't actually do so. The real solution to this sort of attack is not using a VPN but rather is using isolation.    OpenVPN would have protected you from that specific attack.    Yup.

The main weakness in your setup is that your ISP can triangulate your location via the cel modem.  If you live in a dense city or only work from public locales then that is not so much of a problem.  If you live in the 'burbs or country they can figure out where you are pretty accurately.  Of course with a regular wired ISP they know not only where you are but who you are (unless you piggy-back off someone else's account).  But back to the VPN question -- your VPN encrypts all traffic between your computer and the VPN's servers, so if you use the VPN for everything your ISP will never know who you are no matter what sites you visit.  The VPN is another matter because they will decrypt your web traffic on its way out of their servers, and if that traffic is not itself SSL encrypted and any of your http traffic identifies you (for example, logging into a site with your real identity and the site doesn't use SSL for all its traffic, which most don't), then your VPN can potentially know who you are.  That said, I'd prefer that a VPN is potentially able to ID me over an ISP any day.

","Just connect in the order you want the services to work.So, for example, if you want Tor > VPN, then open your Tor browser and when you see the ""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor."" then you're connected to Tor. Now, connect to your VPN the usual way. You're done.The reverse is also true. For VPN > Tor you connect to your VPN the normal way (hopefully using OpenVPN) and then you load up your Tor browser and all your Tor traffic will run through the VPN.The comment about VPN > Tor = jail isn't entirely accurate. That was printed in the opsec brief by grugq. VPN > Tor protects you from your ISP sniffing your traffic...or even knowing you're on Tor (for the most part) because you're first connecting through a VPN. All your ISP knows is that you've connected to a server in Austria (or wherever). They can't sniff your traffic. The downside is that anything you do unencrypted on clearnet can be sniffed by the exit node. If you spend all your time surfing SR and onion sites, then you don't have to worry because you never leave the hidden services and thus do not have an exit node.Tor > VPN protects you from malicious exit nodes. When you exit Tor your traffic is routed through a secure tunnel before you visit any clearnet sites so, in theory, exit node operators cannot sniff any of your traffic. The disadvantage is that your ISP knows you're connecting to Tor. The other disadvantage is you are more vulnerable to Tor exploits that try to identify your ISP. For example, in August if you were one of the people connecting to Freedom Hosting sites using Windows OS and the outdated Tor browser, the FBI javascript exploit could have pulled your real IP address if you were connected Tor > VPN. If you were connected VPN > Tor, then the FBI would have only received your VPN IP address. The FBI would have to then visit your VPN and subpoena records if they want your original ISP. In that case, hopefully you used an offshore VPN that doesn't keep records but you can't be sure they are telling the truth. But that's off-topic."

A VPN either creates an a permenant entry node or a permenant exit node.  Reall bad for anonymity for the layman especially. A person who knows what they're doing, can anonymously buy a VPN with Tor and bitcoin and NEVER link it to their name could hae some use but the bonus anonymity isn't worth it in my opinion and can often blow up in your face i.e. Ross Ulbritch",""

(knowledge of your coins sent from addy A are really in addy C, not B)  furthermore, shared SEND works in a very particular way, and because of the hard set values for their fee & the lack of delay between your initial send and the new receive, it's relatively trivial to find the ""real"" initial transaction. only in instances like the OP has experienced where there was a delay from lack of coins in the shared pool to choose from does it become non-trivial to search the blocks immediately before the one with the suspected shared send. to make it ""harder"" to find, blockchain should artificially delay the end result tx for a few blocks. or send the 2 parts of the end tx in 2 different blocks. it's very easy to piece back together at the moment.  the shared COIN offering however, works quite differently..... with that one, the server itself doesnt even know whose coins are whose. in fact, none of the other participants know either! the bad news about that, is that there is no way to guarantee your transaction history will become different. the really GOOD thing about shared coin is that the transactions it creates are incredibly difficult to de-anonymize due to the nature of the shared inputs/outputs.  i could be wrong, but that's what i've gathered from reading forum posts.  someone who knows more than me should really comment and clarify.  xoxo -mb",""

Below is a post containing an excellent PGP tutorial (written by Guru) which will solve all your problems I'm sure when running PGP on a Mac.     PGP Tutorial for Mac users only - written by the great Guru, a former knowledgeable and very helpful forum member.   GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected. If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.  If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.  Download and install GPGTools: https://releases.gpgtools.org/GPG%20Suite%20-%202013.10.22.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools, what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.  Keyboard shortcuts: ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection: Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection: Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection: Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint: Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key: Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection: Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V  Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.  N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.  Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.  To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.  Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:  Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File: Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File: Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File: Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File: Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.  To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.  Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.  Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.  To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).  When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.  To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously. ","I have a Mac OS X computer (2013 iMac 3.2GhZ Quad-Core Processor; 1GB GDDR5 NViDia RAM; 27"" screen). I figure a lot of those specs dont matter but I just thought I'd post it.Anyways I have been using the same PGP key for about a year now and I sometime switch between the mail clients Thunderbird and PostBox (which both use Enigmail, although PostBox is only compatible with v1.2 and the one for Thunderbird is like 1.7). I don't think makes a difference though because it has worked before.This is what happens: I get an encrypted message and my decryption works just fine, but when someone send me a decrypted message with my pub key, I am having a hard of a hell time decrypting it. Basically it says it cannot reach the server (but I changed no server setting between that time.I'm curious if there are any application out there that can decrypt and encrypt PGP messages but not send them? That way I can decrypt and encrypt messages because then I can just copy/paste the PGP message in a message in the email web client (or the computer client assuming it allows. I found a few on Android, but I haven't tested them out enough to really get a feel for them; however if they make them for Android, they shoud make it for Mac/PC. Obviously this is very important as I need to be able to decrpyt customer's addresses and certain emails. I have also tried restoring my computer, not necesarily because of this, but because I wanted to Bootcamp Windows 8 so I can play some games on it as Mac either doesn't have most games or no suppoprt for controllers. However, even after reformatting my HDD, (and I did not use Time Machine; well at first I did to get my Photos, Documents, certain applications, music, etc.) But after I backed everything up on a different drive that wasnt a time mnachine because I wanted to do a clean restore but obviously theres always copies of what I save in case there is something I installed that is preventing the sending.Basically the message I get when I try to send a message is 'Outgoing Server Can't Connect', but like I mentioned, I haven't changed any network settings since and I even tried restarting my modem and router, no dice there either."

It was easy to use but now I try to set it up and it detects all sec/pub keys, but when I try to decrypt a message it asks for a ""Symmetric Code"", which I would assume would be the password I created, but it definitely isn't because I just changed it recently to make sure I had it right and before that I tried every possible combination that I have used in the past.

I recommended to someone else on these boards yesterday to get a cheap netbook for darknet operations. Encrypt it fully and install Tor and PGP. If you use Windows or Linux people can help you if you run into any problems. No one knows shit about Mac and Android is a real risk for darknet stuff. You can also run PGP off of a flash key which is called GPG4USB. Encrypt that too. Even better.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","doppelganger_","9236","2013-12-23T22:25:42","Synthetic Urine sample for Preemployment drug screening?","Discussion/Legal","This is a reply I posted in an identical thread in the newbie section a few days ago:  ""I use Quick Fix all the time for randoms at work.  I usually get tipped off the day the piss wagon will be coming around. Or if I know i'm hot sometimes I'll just carry it with me just in case.  My work does a standard 5 panel test which is what most employers do.  Some do a 10 panel but they are more $.  It is not common for a non gov''t job to do extra testing to see if the urine is synthetic.  That test is more for parole, rehab etc.    Like I said,  most places do a 5 panel and don't test for authenticity.     The easiest way to heat it is on a car defroster turned up all the way.  It will only take about 10-15 minutes.  I say this is the easiest b/c you will slowly bring it to where you want it.  If you microwave it, it can heat unevenly and overheat easily.  It's hard to cool it off efficiently IMO. Any 5 and 10 panel test I have ever done requires the urine to be between 90-100F.  This is very important.  I have passed with a drop that was 96 when I poured it in and since the cup is cool it dropped to 92 as I handed it off.  Too close for comfort.  I like to keep it between 98-100.  I do this with a Hot Hands hand warmer.  If you don't have a car to heat or a microwave you can use two warmers rubber banded (one on each side) to heat it up.  This method will take at least 2-3 hours if you keep it in your pocket.  Once you have the bottle up to 98-100 just keep one hand warmer on it and in your pocket.  For me this will hold the urine between 98-100 for at least 6 hours reliably.  I keep a cheap $3 digital thermometer with me to double check the temp occasionally also since the temp strip only goes to 100 and its nice to know how over you are if you are.   When the time comes I just move it from my pocket to my drawers and head into the bathroom.  I fill up a little past the line and squirt the rest into the toilet without flushing.  Then hand the sample over ASAP so the temp doesnt drop too much.  Works every time.   BTW, you can reheat Quick Fix as many times as you want and it will still work.  I used a bottle once that was 6 months old and had been heated at least 10 times before as a precaution.  I think the website even says you can reheat it.  """,""

Most employers will only do a 5-panel test where they dunk a dipstick in your sample and the test shows either negative or positive. It's not like they send it to a lab for in-depth analysis.  You can order the stuff online for anywhere from $10-$50, and you can get it at your local head shop.  Most come with a hand warmer (a pouch that you break the seal and shake up to get warm, kinda like an ice pack) that you rubber band to this little container that has a temperature strip on it, so you know it's in the right range. Keep in mind, this only works if you're not being watched while you 'pee' of course, but most don't. You just tuck the little bottle either in your waste band or wear tight boxer briefs and tuck it in your crotch, and wa-lah! Trust me on this, it works.",""

Just make sure the temperature is correct. If this is a pre-employment screening ,you have nothing to worry about. The only time issues arise with subverting a drug test, is when you're on probation. Last time I had a UA for a job, the woman just handed me the cup and was like I will be here when you are done. A high metabolism/exercise will allow you to beat test easily. Drug tests detect <50 nano grams of THCOOH. You can also drink water before hand to dilute your urine. Creatine levels must be within range for this method.",""

Our goal is to open source the protocol and architecture and help others implement this new technology to address privacy concerns against surveillance and back door threats of any kind."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jeks","1807","2013-11-01T05:23:54","âDark Mail Allianceâ - Lavabit And Silent Circle Join Forces ","Discussion/Security","Lavabit And Silent Circle Join Forces To Make All Email Surveillance-Proof  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/10/30/lavabit-and-silent-circle-join-forces-to-make-all-email-surveillance-proof/  ","The summer of Snowden gives birth to the Dark Mail AllianceIn recent months, Lavabit, based in Texas, and Silent Circle, based in Washington, D.C., both shuttered their encrypted email services. The companies said they couldnât keep them running knowing they were vulnerable to surveillance if faced with a dedicated enough attackerâ¦ which for Lavabit came in the form of the federal government when it wanted access to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowdenâs Lavabit account. Now the companies are teaming up with plans to offer an open-source tool that could make peer-to-peer, end-to-end encryption an easy add-on for any email service. The challenging part: they need to get other email providers â especially the heavyweights, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft â to join them in offering the tool.The easy part: the name, which sounds like a group of superheroes â or supervillains â depending on your perspective on monitoring and data-mining email. Lavabit and Silent Circle are the first two members of the âDark Mail Alliance,â a group of email providers who will give users control over the privacy of their email so that it canât be handed over to third parties, scanned for ads, or easily hijacked by an interceptor. âWeâre taking our inspiration from the Rebel Alliance,â says Levison. âWeâre the rebels who have decided privacy is too important to compromise on. Weâre fighting to bring privacy back to the Internet.ââWe believe email is fundamentally broken in its current architecture,â says Silent Circle CEO Mike Janke, a former Navy SEAL. âThis is an opportunity to create a new email service where the keys are created on the device and only the user can decrypt it.âA very simple logo for a concept dreamed up within the last two monthsThe problem now is that â as the NSA leaks have made us painfully aware â almost all of us store our email with third parties and send it through a digital ether that has many stops along the way where it can be captured. On top of that, thereâs the possibility of our email being hacked, or being scanned by advertisers, or just being opened by a snoopy ex who has your password. Google and others have tried to make email more secure with two-factor authentication, but that doesnât solve that fact that the email sits âin the clearâ on a server or in the cloud somewhere â a vulnerability that hackers can take advantage of. According to a new report from the Washington Post, the NSA has taken advantage of that vulnerability by infiltrating the links to Yahooâs and Googleâs data centers. Lavabit and Silent Circle think email should be unreadable â decodable only by the sender and the recipient. While itâs possible to set-up encryption on your own, itâs a laborious process â I know from experience; the Dark Mail Alliance hopes to streamline it.Lavabit founder Ladar Levison and Silent Circle CEO Mike Janke got to meet and swap tales of encryption woe during a privacy event in Seattle in September. Silent Circleâs impressive cryptography team had been working on a better email encryption system for some time, that wouldnât leak metadata to the provider (or the NSA) nor depend on keys stored on a providerâs server. Levison meanwhile had been fighting the feds for months over their request to fundamentally break the security of his email service in order to get access to one of his usersâ accounts. Levison, who has given up email since shutting Lavabit down, had downloaded Silent Circleâs encrypted text messaging service to have private bi-coastal conversations with his lawyer. He and Janke connected via Silent Circle and sat down in Seattle to talk about coming up with a new system together. Levison then flew to Silent Circleâs headquarters for a week-long project-crunching session with his former-competitorâs engineering team, including master cryptographers Phil Zimmermann and Jon Callas.The âDark Mail Allianceâ plans to release a white paper about their tool, which relies on SMTP and XMPP. While still a work in progress, it will assign a private key to a particular user and populate it across their devices; put public keys and addresses into a public server; and store encrypted email for pick-up in the cloud. Itâs not the first time technology of this sort has been deployed. What would make this different is that it, if successful, wouldnât be sandboxed. If Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Hushmail, and others signed on â and that is a big if â youâd be able to send an encrypted email from one service to another âeasily.â Janke says the user interface is designed so that if youâre sending to an address thatâs part of the system, it glows green, and if itâs not, it glows red.âFeatures of PGP are built into the code itself so it can function like regular email,â says Levison. âWe want to make it easy enough for your grandma to use.ââWe want community participation on the protocols,â says Silent Circle cryptographer Jon Callas. âBut we are not going to be sitting around, waiting for permission to do it. Weâre going ahead with it even if itâs just the two of us.ââWeâre going to try to get as many people involved as possible,â says Janke. Levison announced the formation of âthe Allianceâ Wednesday at Inbox Love, a conference at Microsoftâs Mountain View campus for, as youâd expect, mail geeks. âAll of the major email service providers will be there,â says Levison.But will they want to join the Alliance? Given Lavabitâs dramatic shutdown and the Snowden revelations about the extent of monitoring of our digital communications, thereâs momentum right now for the cause of more private email. And Lavabit and Silent Circle certainly have the industryâs attention. âEveryone knows now that email is broken and has to be fixed,â says Callas. But is that enough to get established providers to join their crew?âWe want to get the Googles, the Yahoos and the Microsofts to stand tall,â says Janke. âBut it will be an interesting friction point. These companies make money by mining their free email.âThe dark mail tool would prevent scans of emails to deliver ads. Another potential downside from a provider perspective is that not being able to scan all emails will make it harder to root out spam, says Levison. But they hope that the fact that all email would be signed with particular keys will make it possible to develop a trust system around identity.Intelligence and law enforcement agencies meanwhile, who have been complaining for years (perhaps disingenuously) about the Internet âgoing dark,â might be the most frustrated with the Alliance. It would make it much harder to monitor peopleâs emails or to read what they have stored in the cloud. I asked Lavabit â who is already fighting a court battle with the FBI â and Silent Circle whether they worried about the government reaction to their plan.Levison says he does worry about criminals â terrorists and child pornographers â using the tool. âBut I balance that with the need to speak privately as a fundamental part of any democracy,â says Levison. âGovernment has brought this on themselves, where this kind of security became a necessity.ââThat horse has left the barn. If law enforcement wants that data, theyâll have to subpoena an individual [rather than their email provider],â says Janke. â I worry more about the big data processors. Google and Microsoft rely on data mining to make their profits. I worry more about them collectively because there is money on the line. I worry about that more than the nation states.âThe Alliance is not just focused on the big dogs. Theyâre also hoping to enlist smaller providers that want to offer more private and secure email services. Levison will play crypto-prophet, with plans to rack up frequent flier miles to help providers and organizations get this up and running when they release the tool in 2014. âIf we have to fly to Switzerland and South Africa, thatâs what weâll do,â says Janke.âWe think the world is ready to embrace a new system,â says Levison."

This is an outline of their international 3-point plan; which is not an official release but was given as an statement on DNM's from the OM to an journalist of volkskrant.nl; one of the leading newspapers in the NL.  PROJECT: ITOM (Illegal Trade on Online Marketplaces)  Source: Dutch only, sorry: http://static3.volkskrant.nl/static/asset/2014/Reactie_Openbaar_Ministerie_6685.pdf  Released 2 days ago      1 . Hindering and stopping vendors, administrators and shutting down hidden markets. Along with serious measures to track down and prosecute vendors. The Hague's Prosecution service which is leading ITOM will soon be holding coordinated international joint operations in the following months (to attempt to take down markets and/or vendors). The involved countries and agencies have already held meetings about this plan in the last few months      2 . More scrutiny on outgoing and incoming pieces of mail within and from the Europe. This will not just involve customs but also mail and postal services themselves before they even leave the sorting center (by the sound of it). It also needs to become much harder to anonymously send drugs through the mail through more thorough investigations and putting up several roadblocks to keep it from being this easy. According to this paper plans for this have already been set in motion since late 2013 but not fully. So this will likely be ramped up.      3 . Chasing the ""Bottleneck"" that is Bitcoin and de-anonymizing cash out methods and ways to turn Bitcoin into cash. They are also making it sound as if they are going after, or at least investigate those who purchase Bitcoin to a certain degree, because to their reasoning there are very little legal ways to spend bitcoin. ITOM soon will also propose a new law or rule-set regarding Bitcoin exchanging and transactions, this is their final mention regarding this point, no other information given.  Funded by the EU(!) in cooperation and planning with the following agencies:  Pretty much every single Dutch investigation agency except the dutch Homeland Security equivalent AIVD      LP, DLR, FIOD, FP & OM (NL)      Europol      Eurojust      FBI (US)      ICE (US)      BKA (DE)      StA (DE)      PGdR (PT)      NCA (UK)      NBI (SE)      This is a partial list, not all agencies where named  And border forces (Custom Inspection) of the following countries:      Estland, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Letland, Litouwen, Poland, Austria...(paper is ended in ""And so on"" likely meaning every other country within the European Union which does not have an agency directly cooperating).  I hope this serves as a warning. We should have seen this coming, and we should also see what is coming in the next few months to years. Having good OPSEC, not leaving any traces and taking this more serious should be incredibly important to all of us, especially those in Europe.  Here's an additional piece of information about Dutch vendors in particular. It reports that the Dutch online drug trade is rivaling the income from the legal coffeeshops:      http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/3757208/2014/09/27/Hoe-online-coffeeshops-een-miljoenenomzet-draaien.dhtml  Translation through google:      https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volkskrant.nl%2Fvk%2Fnl%2F2686%2FBinnenland%2Farticle%2Fdetail%2F3757208%2F2014%2F09%2F27%2FHoe-online-coffeeshops-een-miljoenenomzet-draaien.dhtml&edit-text=  And as a final note, lets not forget that ISP's can see if you are or have been using TOR. In combination with this.  The normal OPSEC standard should be upgraded to some higher security levels for all of us. ",""

MUST READ","Discussion/Security","PLEASE READ IT ALL BEFORE COMMENTING - THIS HAS TAKEN A WHILE TO TYPE UP SO I'M SORRY FOR ANY ERRORS.  Brief Description of DDoS:  - DDOS, short for Distributed Denial of Service, is a type of DOS attack where multiple compromised systems, which are usually infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack. In a DDoS attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources â potentially hundreds of thousands or more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.  IDEA:  Would creating multiple (And I mean 10 or more even 20) SR websites under different website addresses and IP addresses (just like PIRATEBAY have done in the past and still do so there is ALWAYS a website functioning if one goes down) so if an attack happens simply close/cancel or do something like this to the web address and we can carry on as normal BECAUSE WE AS A COMMUNITY will know all of the addresses that will link to SR.  HOW WILL WE KNOW ALL THE ADDRESSES?  DPR should make a thread/topic that can only be accessed via accounts here on SR FORUMS who have 200 posts or more!? (to prevent people making fake accounts to find out such data and spreading it on the normal internet). Here will be an updated list of addresses that could be forever changing on set dates? or just close a website down when an attack has happened and let us know what is going on?  END:  If I am not making too much sense maybe someone with better knowledge than me convert this into something brilliant and get DPR to visit this topic/forum and maybe gain another IDEA which could ultimately prevent future shut downs like we are experiencing now.

Look how much money they made in Florida with the pill mills and with the adderall shortage, they dont give a fuck just more money for them.  Another piece vendors might like:  ""In response to the package that I purchased on January S, 2014, which was marked as undelivered due to its removal from the postal stream, CALIGIRL agreed to send me a replacement shipment of 100 Oxycodone 20 mg tablets""  Not sure if vendors are aware but from this it seems like 'removal from postal stream' COULD be a good indicator of a profiled package.",""

They intercepted several of his inbound packages, how else do you think they found out about his mail box? This is in fact how many investigations start. It would not have been hard for LE to identify him as an SR vendor if they just watched him for some time.  A good 98% of the content in the criminal complaint are irrelevant. Even him giving his information to the DEA was not needed. The DEA actively practices ""parallel"" construction to protect their sources. They want you to think this guy was busted by giving up his information. They do not want you to think he was busted by poor smuggling techniques, because they will use the ignorance of other vendors to their advantage.  Feds like to take their time building up cases. If a large enough international package is accepted, you can be confident they are not going to bust you right then. They could be watching you for months to gather evidence.    You would assume this but it is not true. Experience in many cases rarely equates with the quantity of drugs being moved. There have been a number of ""top vendors"" that have made very amateur mistakes, and some that have even been identified by customers searching them online.    Evidence suggests that LE does not attempt to bust any vendors unless they do something overt to attract LE to the case. Many cases start with seized outgoing or incoming packages at customs, returned packages, and that sort of thing that are direct evidence. Vendors on sites like these are magnitudes more difficult to bust than regular drug dealers that undercover agents can go into a club and buy some drugs and at the end of the night be potentially arresting a supplier that is bigger than most SR vendors. The time and resources required to bust even a single vendor is outrageous in comparison to the petty nature of almost all drug-sales crimes.   ","Not so sure it was being a top vendor. Seems to me the top vendors would be better at what they do. You better have a goddamn good excuse for routine visits to Columbia or they will put eyes on you.;He made a lot of rookie mistakes, I am not debating that nor do I think anyone is. My point stands that I am just blown away by how much time, energy and resources it would appear on the face of it LE is willing to sacrifice just for the chance that someone is stupid enough to make all of these errors. What if Caligirl had not made any of those mistakes? Would LE have just made several purchases, further supporting his business and then eventually just given up on his case? Do they have alternative more difficult routes they use to track people?"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","proliferated","44251","2014-08-17T01:23:17","Please read CALIGIRL mistakes - from announcing holidays, to envelope types","Discussion/Security","   Vendor CALIGIRL Criminal Complaint Excerpts  Posted by: DeepDotWeb July 29, 2014  The summary here is that CALIGIRL sent packages which were easily profiled and all of which went through the same sorting center, allowing for relatively easy backtracking to a specific postal box he would drop his packages off in. Later, he put icing on the cake by allowing the undercover agent to pay directly to his bank account.  What strikes me is just how ridiculously comprehensive the investigation is (the complaint is 73 pages long) and how much data the agent could access. Itâs comparable to MDPro â about the only thing he didnât do is get the ISP to cough up records showing Tor usage. Hereâs a (mostly) comprehensive list of data sources the agent used:      Facebook     Amazon shopping logs and IP     #bitcoin-otc IP & transactions     Local Bitcoin transactions     domain names and telephone     cellphone apps (Ding) usage & callers & IPs     Post Office photos (from automated postal machine)     landlord for his post box     travel records     electronic toll records recording movements of his car     hotels he stayed at (he used places he stayed or was near as return addresses)     financial records from:         Xoom (and IP addresses)         Wells Fargo         JP Morgan Chase         Western Union         MoneyGram  The excerpts:  As part of the investigation, I made two (2) undercover purchases from OALIGIRLâs silk Road account [11 July 2013, 25 September 2013] and six (6) additional undercover purchases from CALIGIRL [9 October 2013, 22 October 2013, 3 January 2014, 5 February 2014] outside of the Silk Road website utilizing an encrypted and anonymized program called Bitmessage. CALIGIRL only accepted the crypto-currency Bitcoin as currency for the purchase of controlled substancesâ¦I placed an additional two (2) undercover purchase orders which were subsequently cancelled by CALIGIRL due to supply issues.  â¦Based upon the reliable package profile developed from the known packages being sent through the USPS, more than 100 additional packages were identified as having been mailed by Jones. In addition to the eight (  undercover controlled substance purchases from Jones/CALIGIRL, an additional four (4) packages containing controlled substances were seized and searched pursuant to federal search warrants issued by the United States District Court in the Northern District of Texas. To date, more than 400 Oxycodone tablets and more than 900 Hydrocodone tablets have been seized or purchased from Jones.  â¦Between April 10, 2013 and September 9, 2013, the CALIGIRL Silk Road account completed 685 finalized sales. From these transactions. CALIGIRL collected Bitcoins valued at approximately \$141,086.19. CALIGIRL also completed additional Silk Road sales valued at approximately \$36,166.05 that were not finalized by the buyer or the funds remained in escrow. The Bitcoin to dollar price was calculated at time of each transaction and was recorded on the Silk Road server.  â¦As CALIGIRL completed 900 Oxycodone orders, 608 Hydrocodone orders, 165 Clonazepam orders and 260 orders for other substances labeled âPrescription,â âPain Reliefâ, âDrugsâ, âAdderallâ, âBenzosâ, ,âTramadolâ, and âLorazepamâ, each finalized sale likely contained multiple products in varying quantities. The transactions were as follows:          24 identified transactions took place in April.2013 with an approximate Bitcoin value of \$2,583.19;         6 identified transactions took place in May 2013 with an approximate Bitcoin value of \$1,030.73.         53 identified transactions took place in June 2013 with an approximate Bitcoin value of \$9,247.72.         225 identified transactions took place in July 2013 with an approximate Bitcoin value of \$47,741.31:         256 identified transactions took place in August 2013 with an approximate Bitcoin value of \$58.324.98: and         Between September 1,2013 and September 9, 2012, 219 identified transactions took place with an approximate Bitcoin value of \$54,373.84.  â¦Utilizing the average price of Bitcoin for the above identified Silk Road transactions, between September 10, 2013 through February 1, 2014, the transactions were worth approximately \$1,152,367.48.  I located a post made by CALIGIRLâs Silk Road account in a message thread titled âVendors/Buyers â Post Future Details and profiles Here â 3rd Backup Releasedâ. The purpose of this message thread was to provide buyers and vendors on the Silk Road website with a means to continue business, despite the shut down and seizure of the Silk Road website. In the message posted by CALIGIRL, an e-mail address of [email protected] and a Bitmessage address were provided. On October 9, 2013, I sent a message to the Bitmessage address that was provided by CALIGIRL. CALIGIRL responded to my message by requesting my identity. I provided CALIGIRL with my undercover identity. CALIGIRL responded by providing me with a âtrustedâ Bitmessage address and instructions to remove the original address. CALIGIRL further stated that future orders for controlled substances made through Bitmessage would be honored.  â¦On July 15, 2013, I received a USPS priority mail package at the undercover commercial post office box location that I provided CALIGIRL as the shipping address for the Oxycodone and Hydrocodone tablets purchased on July 11,2013. The box showed a handwritten return address of â A. Wilson. 2071 N. Collins, Richardson, Texas 75080.â The USPS tracking number showed the package originated in Fort Worth, Texas on July 11, 2013. The package had \$5.80 postage affixed, in the form of one \$5.60 Arlington Green Bridge, stamp and two \$0.10 stamps.  â¦On September 30, 2013, I received a USPS Priority envelope at the shipping address I provided CALIGIRL for the shipment of Oxycodone purchased on September 25, 2013. The Priority envelope had a printed return address of âKara Shea, Travel Professionals, 4903 W. Plano Pkwy, Plano, TX 75093â³. The affixed USPS tracking number showed the package originated at the Coppell, Texas mail sort facility on September 26,2013. The envelope had \$5.60 in postage affixed, in the form of one âArlington Green Bridgeâ \$5.60 stamp.  â¦On October 17,2013, I received a USPS Priority Mail envelope at the undercover address I provided CALIGIRL for the Hydrocodone tablets purchased on October 9, 2013. The USPS Priority envelope had a printed return address of âTyler Randolph, Northwest Insurance, 616 N. Central Expressway, Dallas, TX 75206.â The USPS tracking number affixed indicated the package had originated at the Coppell, Texas mail sort facility on October 9, 2013. The envelope had \$5.60 in postage affixed to it in the form of one âArlington Green Bridgeâ \$5.60 stamp.  â¦On October 25, 2013, I received a USPS Priority mail envelope at the shipping location provided to CALIGIRL for the Hydrocodone purchased on October 22, 2013. The USPS Priority envelope had a printed return address of, âMcKinsey & Co, 2200 Ross Ave, Dallas, Texas 75201.â The USPS tracking number affixed showed the package originated at the Coppell, Texas mail sort facility on October 22,2013. The envelope had \$5.60 in postage affixed, in the form of one âArlington Green Bridgeâ \$5.60 stamp.  â¦I requested that the order not be shipped until January 23,2014. On January 13, 2014, I went to the Coppell, Texas USPS processing plant. Because all of the undercover purchases of controlled substances, except one,17 originated at the Coppell, Texas mail processing plant, Postal Inspectors and I attempted to profile additional packages that could match packages originating with CALIGIRL. A total of four (4) packages matching the profile were removed from the postal stream. The four packages removed all originated from a blue U.S. Mail collection box located at 8135 Forest Lane, Dallas, Texas. That location was approximately 0.4 miles from Jonesâ residence at the time of the shipment, 12009 Coit Road, Apartment 5313M, Dallas, Texas. The additional three (3) packages were addressed to Customer-1, Customer-2, and Customer-3. Federal search warrants, issued by the United States Court, Northern District of Texas, were executed on the additional packages. All three packages were found to contain controlled substances. Specifically, the packages contained: [oxycodone, hydrocodone, clonazepam]  [no mention of whether the customers received controlled deliveries or not]  â¦Also on January 13, 2014, I accompanied a U.S. Postal Inspector to E-Z Mail Services. As detailed later in this affidavit, mailbox 620 at E-Z Mail Services is leased by Jones. While at E-Z Mail services, the owner/manager stated there was a suspicious package in mailbox 620. Inside the mailbox, I observed a small USPS Priority flat rate package that was addressed to Tyler Zeddai. All seams of the box were taped excessively. A federal search warrant, issued by the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas. was executed on the package. Inside the box, I located a âcalm aidâ box and a printed shipping invoice for a natural calming product. Concealed inside the âcalm aid,â I recovered 685 Hydrocodone 5mg tablets.  â¦The USPS Priority envelope had a printed return address of, âBeading Dreams, 5929 W. Lovers Lane, Dallas, TX 75029â². The USPS tracking number affixed indicated the shipment originated in Coppell, Texas on January 21,2014. The envelope had \$5.66 of postage affixed to it in the form of one \$5.00 stamp and two \$0.33 stamps.  â¦The express mail envelope had a handwritten return address of, âStewart Title, 127OO Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75230.â The USPS tracking number affixed indicated that the package originated at the Coppell, Texas sort facility on February 8, 2014. The envelope had \$20.00 of postage affixed in the form of four \$5.00 stamps.  â¦On March 17,2014, I again made contact with CALIGIRL through the Bitmessage program and the âtrustedâ Bitmessage address CALIGIRL supplied to me. I informed CALIGIRL that I wanted to purchase 100 Oxycodone 20mg tablets and 100 âHycodanâ Hydrocodone 5mg tablets, but that I only had in my possession 1.4 Bitcoins which would not cover the cost. In response, CALIGIRL stated that I should contact Matthew Jones and provided me a telephone number of 972-666-1223 for Jones. Further, CALIGIRL stated that Jones was also known as âDYNAMITE2kâ on http://localbitcoins.com/ and would be able to accept cash from me, as well as, provide Bitcoins for the purchase of controlled substances. I contacted Jones on the telephone number provided. Jones stated that he liked to speak to new Bitcoin clients to ensure that both parties understood Jonesâ process and that there were âno surprises.â I told Jones that I wanted to provide him \$1,000 to convert into Bitcoins and then transfer I to CALIGIRL. Jones referred to CALIGIRL as âJenâ. Jones stated that he would provide me with a Wells Fargo Bank account number and account holder name via text message after the conclusion of our phone call. Jones instructed me to go to a Wells Fargo Branch location and deposit the currency directly into the account he provided. Jones told me not to put any information additional to the account holder name and account number, and to not answer any questions that may be asked by the bank teller. After the deposit was completed, Jones instructed me to send him a picture of the deposit slip. On March 18, 2014, I went to the Wells Fargo Bank branch located at 1530 International Parkway, Lake Mary, Florida. I completed a bank deposit slip with the information provided by Jones. I gave the deposit slip and \$1,000 to the bank teller. The bank teller provided me with a deposit receipt. I took a picture of the deposit slip and sent it via text message to Jones. In addition to the photograph that I provided to Jones, Jones stated via text message that he also contacted the bank to confirm the deposit. I asked Jones to confirm the actual amount of Bitcoins that would be credited towards future purchases. Jones stated that I should think in terms of cash, and that, after a 5% commission, \$952.38 would be credited towards future purchases. Based on my training and experience, Jonesâ statements indicated that no conversion to Bitcoin was taking place; Jones was both the recipient of the currency and the sender of the controlled substances.  â¦The tracking number indicated the package received its first scan at the Coppell, Texas sort facility at 10:OO p.m. on March 18, 2014. Also affixed to the envelope was an Automated Postal (âAPCâ) computer generated postage stamp valued at \$5.60. The APC postage indicated a purchase date of March 17, 2014 and a purchase zip code of 75260. The APC machine was located at the Dallas Main Post Office, 401 Dallas Fort Worth Turnpike, Dallas, Texas 75260. The USPS Priority envelope had a printed return address of âTonya Berent, LPC, 9323 Dove Meadow Dr., Dallas, 75243â³ affixed to it. â¦The United States Postal Inspector service subsequently provided me with the images captured by the APC machine during the purchase of the postage affixed to the package I received on March 20,2014. I compared the APC images to known images of Jones, including publicly available images on Facebook and found them to match. Additionally, I showed the images to DEA TFAs who have previously seen Jones in person. These agents also confirmed that the photographs depicted Jones. As part of this investigation, I reviewed telephone toll information for 972-666-1223 obtained from Dingtone, Inc. (Dingtone25). Telephone number 972-666-1223 was the number that CALIGIRL told me to call when I needed to speak to Jones.  â¦During the course of this investigation, I reviewed records obtained from Amazon.com (âAmazonâ) relating to Jonesâ purchases from its website. The records reviewed included purchase, shipping, billing, and IP address information. The records showed that, on July 2, Jones utilized his Amazon account to purchase 1000 3â³x5â³ clear plastic zip lock baggies and 500 4â³ x 8â³ bubble mailer manila envelopesâ¦Jones completed the Amazon transaction from IP address 184.146.37.164. I geo-located this IP address to Columbia. As detailed in this affidavit, Jones is known to frequently travel to Colombia. Jones has also accessed Bitcoin trading Internet chat rooms from this IP address. Specifically, on March 24,2013, Jones accessed the chat room #bitcoin-otc under the pseudonym âDynamiteâ from IP address 184.146.37.164.37. Jones was authenticated on the chat room by the Bitcoin-otc authentication software, providing proof that âDynamiteâ was indeed Jones and not someone attempting to utilize his pseudonym.  â¦I utilized Jonesâ telephone number, 214-853-5236, to locate additional domain names registered by Jones. I located 12 additional domain names containing 214-853-5236 in the WHOIS records. Included in the list of domain names were www.aflinqtonhardware.com, vqww.fedi-check.com, and www.ledicharoe.cgm. All of these domains listed an address of 2602 McKinney Avenue, Dallas, Texas as the contact address. As detailed in this affidavit, the address 2602 McKinney Avenue, Dallas, Texas was utilized as the return address on a package identified by the United States Postal Inspector as originating with CALIGIRL. This package was placed in the mail stream on or about August 23, 2013.  â¦During the course of this investigation, I reviewed Jonesâ records obtained from the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA). Jones uses a NT|A account and transponderâ¦.The NTTA records that I reviewed covered the time period of August 24, 2013 through February 21,2014. The toll charges incurred on the NTTA account detail that Jonesâ vehicle utilized NTTA roads to travel between Jonesâ former residence, 12009 Coit Road, Apartment 5313M, Dallas, Texas and Jonesâ commercial mailbox located at E-Z Mail Services.  â¦During this investigation, I reviewed records obtained from Xoom Corporation regarding Jonesâ Xoom account. Xoom is an online wire transfer service that provides consumer currency remittanceâ¦During this period, Jones sent Xoom wire transfers \$58,022.57 totaling in a total of 131 transactions. Of these transactions. 128 transactions, totaling \$57,472.57, were sent to Colombia. The remaining three transactions, totaling \$550, were sent to Costa Rica. 31 of these transactions, totaling \$20,979, were sent to âMateo Jones,â which is an alias utilized Matthew Jones on Facebook. The average value of these transfers by was \$676.74. All of the wire transfers sent to âMateo Jonesâ were received in Ban Columbia account number xxxxxxx5028. 57 of the Xoom transactions, totaling \$27,091.07, were sent to âP.C.E.,â Jonesâ spouse. The average value of these transfers was \$475.29. All the wire transfers sent to âP.C.E.â were received in BanColumbia account number xxxxxx831 1. 145. 19 of the Xoom transactions, totaling \$5,174, were sent to âA.G.R.â The average value of these transfers was \$272.32. All of the wire transfers sent to ?.G.R.â were received in BanColumbia account number xxxxxx3764. The transactions sent to âA.G.R.â appeared to have been structured in a manner to intentionally avoid triggering money laundering and reporting requirements. There were multiple transactions made on the same day to the same person and there were several transactions over a short time frame to the same person. These transactions also appeared to have been structured in order to remove currency from the United States without triggering currency export reporting requirements. The remaining transactions, totaling 94,251.50, had a consistent relationship between the sender and recipient of the funds. Additionally, the funds were sent in consistent amounts with the average transfer amount being \$177.15. 70 of the Xoom wire transfers, totaling \$31,374.83, were funded utilizing Jonesâ Wells Fargo debit card xxxxxx6133. This card debited money from Jonesâ Wells Fargo account xxxxxx5888. Jones received statements for this Wells Fargo account at his E-Z Mail Services mailbox. 40 of the Xoom wire transfers, totaling S,S37.74, were funded utilizing Jonesâ Diners Club card, xxxxxx5536. This card was issued to Jones by 49BHO Harris Bank. Jones received statements for his Diners Club credit card at his E-Z Mail Services mailbox. The remaining wire transfers were paid utilizing other debit and credit cards issued to Jones. Jones discontinued utilizing Xoomâs services after August 2, 2013. As Xoom operates as an online service, the records they provided also included IP addresses that Jonesâ account was accessed from. I performed IP address lookups on the provided IP addresses. During the period Jones used Xoom, his account was accessed from IP addresses located in Dallas, Texas, Wilmington, North Carolina, and from IP addresses located in Colombia. The Xoom account was also accessed from IP address 38j07.218.2. I identified this IP address as assigned to the Sheraton Dallas Hotel. The Sheraton Dallas is located at 400 N. Olive Street, Dallas, Texas and is connected by elevated walkway to Jonesâ place of employment. The Sheraton Dallas was utilized as a return address on packages containing controlled substances, including several of the packages seized on January 13,2014 at the Coppell, Texas U.S. postal Service sort facility.  â¦I reviewed records for Wells Fargo account xxxxxx5888, a checking account opened by Jones on February 8, 2010. When opening the account, Jones provided his Texas driverâs license, Social Security number, and a Citi Group MasterCard as forms of identificationâ¦.I also reviewed Wells Fargo savings xxxxxx4421 which was opened at the same time as account xxxxxxx5888. â¦An additional \$10,853.56 was deposited at ATM machines. The Wells Fargo counter and ATM deposits were in inconsistent amounts, occurred on a variety of dates, and were made at a variety of geographical areas. Based on my training and experience, this activity is consistent with Bitcoin sales where a Bitcoin customer makes a pre-arranged counter-deposit into a Bitcoin dealerâs bank account. â¦Bitcoin exchange deposits \$7,493.71. Dwolla, into the account totaled an online Bitcoin exchange, deposits accounted for $6,409.71. Coinbase, another online Bitcoin exchange, deposits totaled $1,084.04. Notably, there were no Bitcoin related debits from any of the accounts I reviewed during any time periodâ¦Between June 14, 2013 and July 29, 2013, Jones utilized his Wells Fargo debit card to make 9 transactions with the United States Postal Service. The purchases were made at the Arlington, Texas U.S. Post Office and the Dallas, Texas U.S. Post Office. Jones spent \$435 during these transactions. The average amount spent at USPS was \$48.33. The highest value transactions took place on July 19, 2013 and July 29, 2013, and were both for \$119.70. Jones has no known legitimate business requiring heavy use of the USPS.  â¦As part of my investigation, I reviewed financial records obtained from JP Morgan Chase (JPMC) regarding accounts held at that institution by Jones for JPMC account xxxxxx9730. The account was opened on December 7, 2009 by Jones, who provided his Texas driverâs license as a form of identification when opening the account. â¦On August 15, 2013, Jones utilized the debit card associated with account xxxxxx9730 to make a \$23.66 purchase and a \$404 ATM withdrawal at a Walmart in Port Isabel, Texas. During this same time period, known packages originating with CALIGIRL were mailed from Port Isabel, Texas. These packages were sent using Express Mail on August 14,2013 and August 15, 2013. On July 9, 2013, Jones utilized the Chase debit card associated with account xxxxxx9730 to make a \$117.85 purchase at the United States Post Office in Dallas, Texas.  â¦As part of this investigation, I reviewed records received from Western Union relating to Jonesâ use of its wire transfer services. The records covered the time period of September 21 , 2013 through October 9, 2013. Between September 22, 2013 and October 9, 2013, Jones received 53 Western Union wire transfers totaling 933,404.23. The wire transfers were initiated by multiple subjects and originated in different geographic allocations. The originating locations included 16 different states, Mexico, Chile, Germany, and Sweden. Of the 53 identified transactions, the average amount received by Jones was \$630.26. The largest single transaction during this time period was \$1,047.92 and was received by Jones on October 6, 2013. The smallest single transaction identified was \$209 and was received by Jones on September 21, 2013.  â¦As part of my investigation, I reviewed Jonesâ use of MoneyGram wire transfer services. The records reviewed include transactions dated between September 28, 2013 and October 8, 2013â¦Between September 28, 2013 and October 8, 2013, Jones received 23 MoneyGram wire transfers, totaling \$12,872.22. The wire transfers were initiated by multiple individuals and originated in different geographical locations including 13 different states and Brazil. Of the 23 transactions, the average dollar amount received by Jones was \$559.66. The largest single transaction was $899 and was received by Jones on October 5, 2013. The smallest transactions received by Jones were for \$450. Jones received nine \$450.00 wire transfers during the period, all of which originated with different individuals.  â¦Jones operated on LBC under the pseudonym âDynamite2kâ. Through his LBC profile, I was able to determine that Jones utilized LBC to make over 100 Bitcoin trades, with 97 unique partners. Jones received 100% positive feedback.","Quote from: proliferated on August 17, 2014, 01:03:57 amQuote from: HonestCocaine on August 17, 2014, 01:01:55 amQuote from: Jack N Hoff on August 17, 2014, 12:12:48 amLets also not forget that he gave his personal bank account details to an undercover agent that was a customer of his on Silk Road.What I am confused about then is why LE was dumping money on him in the first place. What was that going to do if he never gave up information, close to nothing? The bank account thing sure, but the rest before that made me scratch my head.I think it's fair to say that we don't know the actual sequential order of the events.

Now Cyrus Farivar reports in Ars Technica that a fundraiser reached more than $16,000 in a public call to perform a full security audit on TrueCrypt. 'Lots of people use it to store very sensitive information,' writes Matthew Green, a well-known cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University. 'That includes corporate secrets and private personal information. Bruce Schneier is even using it to store information on his personal air-gapped super-laptop, after he reviews leaked NSA documents. We should be sweating bullets about the security of a piece of software like this.' According to Green, Truecrypt 'does some damned funny things that should make any (correctly) paranoid person think twice.' The Ubuntu Privacy Group says the behavior of the Windows version [of Truecrypt 7.0] is problematic. 'As it can't be ruled out that the published Windows executable of Truecrypt 7.0a is compiled from a different source code than the code published in ""TrueCrypt_7.0a_Source.zip"" we however can't preclude that the binary Windows package uses the header bytes after the key for a back door.' Green is one of people leading the charge to setup the audit, and he helped create the website istruecryptauditedyet.com. 'We're now in a place where we have nearly, but not quite enough to get a serious audit done.'"""

PLEASE!","Discussion/Security"," Given what happened in the last few months, can you blame them? Any number of people criticized those of us who begged, pleaded and implored people to learn and use PGP.  We were called cranks, paranoid and worse -- sadly, the FBI proved us right.    Here is a tutorial Guru wrote that'll help you get up and running...  GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected.  If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.  If you have Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , the following instructions  should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.  Download and install GPGTools: https://gpgtools.org/#gpgsuite  Once you have installed GPGTools,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.  Keyboard shortcuts: ===================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V  Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.  To copy your key to a TextEdit document, open up TextEdit, so you have a blank document open. Then you can use the Insert My Key command, Shift-Command-K -- this will bring up a little dialog box, where you can choose your key from the drop-down box; click Choose Key, and the key will be inserted into your TextEdit document.  You can then use Command-A to highlight the key, and Command-C to copy it to the clipboard. You can then use Command-V to paste your public key into a PM (to me) for example.  N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.  Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.  To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.  Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:  Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.  To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.  Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.  Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.  To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to highlight the entire document. Then use  Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your  PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can  check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to  me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).  When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.  To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

""IX. CONCLUSION We have analyzed the security properties of Tor hidden services and shown that attacks to deanonymize hidden services at a large scale are practically possible with only a moderate amount of resources. We have demonstrated that collecting the descriptors of all Tor hidden services is possible in approximately 2 days by spending less than USD 100 in Amazon EC2 resources. Running one or more guard nodes then allows an attacker to correlate hidden services to IP addresses using a primitive traffic analysis attack.""",""

And while they've fixed some of the issues, they're still working some tickets related to it and .onion descriptor harvesting.   It's not all fixed yet.  CLEARNET URL from one of the threads on the tor lists that queries open tickets regarding hidden services.  This URL is definitely unique enough that you shouldn't just paste it into your clearnet browser.  View it over Tor, please.  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=needs_information&status=needs_review&status=needs_revision&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&keywords=~tor-hs  Thanks for reposting this, iaamf!  I hadn't read it since it came out, but in light of recent events, it's well worth another read.  If you believe the FBI/NSA found the server first, then found DPR, this method, or one similar to it, is probably the easiest explanation.  Obviously fits FH as well.  Paper wasn't published until May, but was circulating before then to a handful of Tor developers (according to Mike Perry's post).   Researcher's testing started in late 2012.    During the epic constant rehashing of the FH attack theories, I think lots of folks (myself included), figured ""That can't be it.. Silk Road is still around, and that has to piss them off just as much"".  In retrospect, by that point, SR was already done for.  There's probably a good lesson there for assumptions everyone is making now.  That attack, performed in Spring 2013, could have cheaply deanonymized SR as well as FH/Tormail.   Early access to the paper/research/code from the University of Luxembourg probably would have made it possible earlier in '13.

Also, no, Bitmessage does not have a server.  The fact that you're making fun of that statement shows you have no idea how it works.  Messages are stored in a 2-day long trailing cut-off blockchain.  It is completely decentralized, like Bitcoin.  There is no server.

The only thing they can possibly offer is that the person running it ""might"" not be LE, and the server ""might"" not be discovered and all the data seized. If your security model depends on the hope that your mail provider isn't the FBI, you are pretty fucked. I don't see ""impossible to accidentally connect from your real IP"" as an advantage, if you are doing anything serious you should be using TAILS, and if not how hard is it to look up in the corner and make sure you are using Tor Browser?  The disadvantages to using a .onion host are pretty big. For starters they are not professional operations. A number of them have had serious downtime and issues with mail delivery. The owners also might decide at anytime to just stop running it. All of them use clearnet domains for incoming mail which the police could seize tomorrow if they felt like it, which would let them intercept all incoming messages and totally cripple the service.  Using a large clearnet service, you have solid uptime and your emails actually get delivered. A service with a public company behind it is much less likely to shutdown tomorrow without any warning. The police can access your data, but they need a warrant or court order of some sort, which can be made more difficult to obtain by choosing an email provider in a country you are not buying or selling drugs to or from. If the FBI does turn out to be running one of the current .onion providers, they can harvest all that info without a single warrant.  What information will their warrant get them? Your IP Address? No, because you used Tor to create the account and everytime you logged in to check for mail. The contents of your emails? No, because you are using the vendor's PGP key to encrypt messages to them, and attach your personal PGP key so they can encrypt any replies. The message metadata? Sure, they'll know you emailed the vendor and can see if you were stupid enough to put anything criminal in the subject line, but  they can see all that anyway.  Vendors email addresses are public knowledge, they put them in their PGP keys and in their profiles as backup contact methods. The US has the ability to harvest the metadata from all of the world's email traffic, and I would bet my ass that vendor email addresses are part of their collecting filters. The NSA has been handing out tips to the DEA for years, and drug dealing is one of the biggest revenue sources for terrorists, right behind counterfit air jordans.",""

The only way to get around it is to practice proper opsec and decentralize or compartmentalize whenever you can. This goes for safe-mail, yandex, yahoo, lelantos, bm or whoever else you're using.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","27066","2014-02-19T15:55:10","Safe-Mail Users Please Read","Discussion/Security"," You're missing the point entirely. ALL clearnet email providers should be avoided like the plague. Why, you might ask?  Because if a provider can be found, they can be presented with legal paper, or get a visit to persuade them to cooperate by turning over information. This is precisely what was done with Lavabit -- Ladar Levison got a visit from two agents who demanded not just Snowden's information, but the information on ALL of Lavabit's users. (What the ended up demanding was the SSL private key, so they could snoop on users as they logged-in, to get their username/passwords, and thus access to their email accounts.)  Levison refused, and shutdown the service.   Google has written procedures on how to deal with law-enforcment requests. So do Microsoft (Outlook.com, Live.com, Hotmail.com) Yahoo and virtually every other provider (including Safe-Mail).    The idea behind using a service like MailTor, or other similar aervices run as Tor hidden services, is that the operators are anonymous, and cannot be identified nor located without going to a large amount of difficulty -- it's not as easy as waltzing into a clearnet provider's corporate offices with legal paper (or a badge).  Are these services perfect? Hardly. They have at least two potential pitfalls:   1) They potentially run the risk of being located and the server seized, particularly if the Admin is careless -- the original TorMail is the poster child for this;  or   2) They could be honeypots, run by LEA or an intelligence agency.   There is simply no way to know -- you're taking a chance. In my opinion, the probability of scenarios 1 and 2 being true is less than a clearnet email provider being convinced to cooperate with the authorities. The cardinal rule here is: no one is going to go to jail to protect you.    If Safe-Mail wasn't aware of a problem prior to the Forbes article, they are sure aware of it now. If for no other reason than to protect their reputation, they are going to have to take some action. I suspect they are going to ramp-up their scanning of email accounts for certain keywords -- some of my sources have told me they have been doing this for some time.

Reminds me of nothing so much as the claims Hushmail made in their FAQs, when they absolutely assured their users that all they could ever surrender to the authorities, even if presented with a warrant/court order, would be an encrypted copy of the email(s).  Many of their customers relied on that explicit assurance, and are now serving hard time. If you're not getting a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu, you should be.    Sounds like another Privnote clone to me.  A basic rule of security is not to involve any more parties in an activity than you have to. It only stands to reason -- the more people that know about a secret, the greater the likelihood of a leak. Remember the old adage: ""Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead.""   Services like this were primarily used by people who were unwilling (or unable) to learn to use PGP. If you are using PGP, the service essentially becomes superfluous.

Great advice on webmail - dont really need email anyway for my limited use, at least for now.  ","Quote from: wambamthxmam on February 23, 2014, 01:20:56 amJust checked, I'm locked out. Didn't do much on it but I did test it a bunch... shit. And it's tied to my keys so, new key pair? noob question: So then what? What email address do I use? PGP requires an email address correct? Not using my own host acct. and I think gmail is a mistake for the same reasons. Saying that you're locked-out, covers a LOT of territory. Let's try to narrow things down a bit, shall we? 1) Have you been logging-in using the correct URL?  You should have been using: silkroad6ownowfk.onion -- if you have used anything else, your account may have been phished. 2) Are you getting an ""invalid credentials"" error message? This is usually related to using an incorrect username or password. 3) Failure to decrypt encrypted challenge string. Problems here usually stem from the fact that people have pasted-in the wrong PGP public key, i.e. one that does not belong to them, for which they do not have the private half. If you read the TFA stickied post, you will see in there a step (in red) which you can use to verify you use the right key BEFORE you paste it into the field. If you paste-in the wrong key, you will never be able to decrypt the challenge message, and will be locked out of your account. The only option will be for a staff member to go into your account and manually uncheck the Use TFA checkbox. Depending on which key got used, generating a new keypair may not be necessary. In any case, generating a new keypair can be used to setup TFA on a new account, but will not solve the problem(s) with the existing account. When generating keys to use on Darkmarket sites, I would advice NEVER using a clearnet email provider, e.g. Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Safe-Mail, etc.  Use one like Mailtor, instead, if you must use an email address at all. If you look at my key, you'll see that it reads: Nightcrawler@SR. You don't hve ato use an email address at all if you don't want to. If the software you're using gets pissy about he format, just use: username@SR.onion or something like that, replacing username with the username you want. "

And remember that the bitinstant guy that was arrested was using safe-mail and his emails were turned over, so we know they cooperate with LE.  We can and must assume every email provider cooperates with LE, and take the appropriate precautions at all times.  onion email services that I've tried have been sketchy at best.  The infamous tormail was down more than it was up, and I was never able to actually set up a mailtor account successfully.  On top of that we must assume that these services are LE honeypots because we can't know they're not, which means we must use the same precautions with onion email services that we do with non-onion services.  The ONLY benefit to using an onion email provider is that you CAN'T access it outside Tor so you won't ever make that mistake.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","27066","2014-02-18T12:10:24","Safe-Mail Users Please Read","Discussion/Security","Quote from: Jolly Roger on February 16, 2014, 09:13:53 am      Wow, thank you for sharing Nightcrawler. It escapes me why it is     called ""safe-mail""    No kidding.  The fact that ""safe-mail"" has become the email provider of choice on Silk Road is a disaster in the making. I am reminded of nothing so much as the role Hushmail played in 2007, with the DEA's Operation Raw Deal (ORD).  In ORD, Hush provided the DEA with ""one stop shopping"" as it were, as all the suspects were using Hushmail. Buyers, sellers, sources of supply (SOSes) all conveniently gathered in one place -- it was a fucking turkey shoot!  The DEA boasted of having obtained in excess of 100,000 decrypted emails from Hush. Even as late as 2012 -- some 5 years later -- I was still hearing of busts taking place from the Hushmail data haul.  Sometime later this year, I think we're going to see history repeat itself, only this time, instead of Hushmail, it'll be Safe-Mail. Recent events will only make this more likely -- let me explain:  When SR1 went down, there was a frantic scramble on the part of buyers to locate vendor contact information, primarily email addresses. With the most recent events here on SR, we're seeing some people say, ""Fuck Markets!"" and vowing to conduct business over email. The loss of BMR and its Forum, and Utopia and its Forum will only exacerbate matters. As hacks and/or thefts proliferate, people are becoming leery of centralized marketplaces, so they are turning, in ever greater numbers, to older, alternative methods like email. Once again, the provider of choice seems to be Safe-Mail.  Accordingly, I suspect over the next few months, that there will be some changes to Safe-Mail's operations: we'll start seeing Tor exit nodes blocked, and perhaps even bridges. No doubt the Feds will put a bug in the ear of the Safe-Mail operators. Also, without a doubt, the carrot and the stick will be employed -- the carrot will be some type of financial incentive, and the stick will be the threat of prosecution, or some other type of governmental pressure (perhaps an audit?) for non-compliance.  So, as a result, when enough users are using Safe-Mail, then the operators suddenly make it difficult, if not impossible, to connect via Tor, meaning that the only way to connect will be directly (or via VPN) both of which mean that the user can be located/identified.  Religious use of PGP will blunt this threat somewhat, but not completely. If you can be located/identified, then you can be raided, and forced to give up your PGP secret key and passphrase. Case in point: Ross Ulbricht. You can bet that every encrypted message he ever received has now been decrypted, and is in the hands of the Feds.  It's going to be an interesting year.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","27066","2014-02-18T19:54:43","Safe-Mail Users Please Read","Discussion/Security","A few days subsequent to writing my post on Safe-Mail shown above,  some kind soul sent me a copy of an article written by Runa A. Sandvik, writing for Forbes:   The Email Service The Dark Web Is Actually Using  As denizens of the dark web run from law enforcement's expanding crackdown on anonymous online services, they've found a new favorite email provider: a little known Israeli company called Safe-mail. Whether they've chosen wisely remains to be seen.  In July last year, while investigating a hosting company known for hosting child porn sites with thousands of users, the FBI incidentally seized the entire email database of a popular anonymous webmail service called TorMail. The service was frequently used by high-profile members of anonymous drug market sites, including Dread Pirate Robertsâthe operator of the Silk Road anonymous drug marketâand tony76, the vendor believed to have scammed users of up to a quarter million dollars in Bitcoin last year.  Login page for the Safe-mail web service  [image] Caption: Login page for the Safe-mail web service  On Aug. 5 of last year, Dread Pirate Roberts posted on the Silk Road forum advising users to think back on their TorMail usage and assume everything sent or received there without encryption could now be read by law enforcement. âI personally did not use the service for anything important, and hopefully neither did any of you,â he wrote.  The takedown of TorMail forced users to look for a new anonymous webmail provider; preferably a secure service outside the U.S., accepting of connections from the Tor network, and with lax registration requirements. Following many lengthy discussions on the Silk Road forum, it appears a large number of users decided to make Safe-mail, a provider of a âfree high security web-based email systemâ based in Jerusalem, Israel, the new king of email for the dark web.  Known users of the Safe-mail web service include operators, vendors and customers of the dark web's many drug market sites, journalists writing about the investigation into Silk Road, and BTCKing, the vendor who ran an underground anonymous Bitcoin exchange and allegedly worked with BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem to sell more than $1 million worth of Bitcoins to users of Silk Road.  According to a recent press release, Safe-mail Limited is a four-year-old company âspecializing in secure feature rich messaging systems.â The company describes its email service as âthe most secure, easy to use communication systemâ with an âencrypted mail system with collaboration features and document storage functions.â To sign up, the service only requires that users choose a username and password, providing a first and last name is optional.  When I reached out to Safe-mail for comment, Amiram Ofir, Safe-mail's President and CEO, responded in an email that the company and its employees âcertainly are not aware of any criminal activity,â adding that the company does âfollow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court. Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities.â It's worth noting, however, that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. in 1998. An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server, according to the criminal complaint of Sept. 27, 2013.  Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected, and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user-specific keys. When asked if Safe-mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non-Israeli law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, Ofir replied with a short âYes.â My followup email, asking if Safe-mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user's key, went unanswered.   Forbes is read by virtually every suit in existence, especially government suits. If the strategy I outlined above hadn't occurred to them already, you can bet your life that is has now.  Management may or may not have been ignorant of what's been going on of late, but they have a heads-up now.  The only question is Safe-Mail's management going to take pre-emptive action, or will they wait for LEA to call the tune?

Specifically, what I mean is something like this:Consider an output that is involved with some kind of crime, like a theft or extortion. A ""redlist"" is an automatically maintained list of outputs derived from that output, along with some description of why the coins are being tracked. When you receive funds that inherit the redlisting, your wallet client would highlight this in the user interface. Some basic information about why the coins are on the redlist would be presented. You can still spend or use these coins as normal, the highlight is only informational. To clear it, you can contact the operator of the list and say, hello, here I am, I am innocent and if anyone wants to follow up and talk to me, here's how. Then the outputs are unmarked from that point onwards. For instance, this process could be automated and also built into the wallet.I have previously elaborated on such a scheme in more detail here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157130.60, along with a description of how you can avoid the redlist operator learning anything about the list's users, like who is looking up an output or who found a match.Lately I was thinking about this in the context of CryptoLocker, which seems like it has the potential to seriously damage Bitcoin's reputation. The drug war is one thing - the politics of that are very complex. Extortion is something else entirely. At the moment apparently most people are paying the ransom with Green Dot MoneyPak, but it seems likely that future iterations will only accept Bitcoin.Specifically, threads like this one https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=330720.0 concern me a lot. Summary: a little old lady was trying to buy bitcoins via the Canada ATM because she got a CryptoLocker infection. She has no clue what Bitcoin is beyond the fact that she needed some and didn't know what to do.The risk/reward ratio for this kind of ransomware seems wildly out of proportion - Tor+Bitcoin together mean it takes huge effort to find the perpetrators and the difficulty of creating such a virus is very low. Also, the amount of money being made can be estimated from the block chain, and it's quite large. So it seems likely that even if law enforcement is able to take down the current CryptoLocker operation, more will appear in its place.I don't have any particular opinion on what we should talk about. I'm aware of the arguments for and against such a scheme. I'm interested in new insights or thoughts. You can review the bitcointalk thread on decentralised crime fighting http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157130.60 to get a feel for what has already been said.I think this is a topic on which the Foundation should eventually arrive at a coherent policy for. Of course I know that won't be easy. "

Furthermore I will argue that this flexibility is a significant win for consumers, resulting in cheaper and more reliable transactions, higher quality protection and superior results for the economy.Definition. Consumer protection mechanisms have over time become widely adopted across many jurisdictions and payment networks. They are the mechanism by which consumers are insulated against non-delivery by a merchant (whether malicious or accidental), as well as hacking and outright fraud. Additionally, they protect honest merchants by preventing competitors gaining an unfair market advantage via dishonest or other deemed unacceptable behaviours.Chargebacks. A chargeback is a common form of dispute mediation implemented in credit card networks. Chargebacks allow consumers to dispute a charge on their account and if successful, get it reversed. Typically this results in the merchant having the money taken back out of their account, and possibly fined or being ejected from the card network. Chargebacks can occur for a variety of reasons, such as non delivery of goods, being billed for a service that was not wanted, resolution of administrative errors and unacceptably low quality. However the most common reason is use of stolen credit card details. Merchants are allowed to fight chargebacks and win the dispute in approximately 40% of cases.Identity theft. Because credit cards can be charged only with details that must be given to online merchants to make a purchase, theft of these details is extremely common. Although ultimately caused by the ""pull"" design of credit card systems, merchants end up paying the price - transactions caused by theft of credentials result in an automatic win by the consumer.Friendly fraud. The combination of chargebacks and lax card security can result in serious abuse. So called ""friendly fraud"" is where ordinary consumers initiate fraudulent or grossly unfair chargebacks. Because card networks compete harder to obtain users than merchants, they have little incentive to resolve this problem. An example would be that the porn industry has much higher chargeback rates (and thus fees) than normal, due to consumers legitimately purchasing pornography and then claiming it wasn't them when caught by their partners.Professional fraud. Some payment providers have inadequate dispute mediation procedures in place. For example, PayPal requires proof of postage from a seller or else the buyer automatically wins any dispute. This leads to a common scam in which a fraudster purchases an item from a seller online, pays via PayPal and then picks it up in person from the victims front door. Hours after the fraudster has left, the payment is reversed and because no postage was involved, the victim loses both the goods and the money.Financing of terrorism. The chargeback structure combined with the dominance of a handful of payment networks yields little incentive to create better security or dispute mediation procedures. Criminals know this and exploit that fact. Stolen credit card details can cost as little as $3.50 on the black market. Once obtained by ""carders"" they can be pumped for money. Because the identity details are all stolen anti-money laundering requirements do not help with finding the perpetrators. This was used to great effect by an al-Qaeda cell investigated as part of Operation MAZHAR. Over $3 million was raised for the Iraqi insurgency via carding.Additional costs. One reason that credit card transactions are so expensive is the cost of dealing with fraudulent chargebacks. Many businesses implement their own risk analysis systems and review procedures above and beyond those provided by banks and card networks, because they find it to be the only way of controlling fraud rates. Even so, large losses are inevitable, and those losses are passed on via price rises and fees.Bitcoin and consumer protection. Bitcoin was explicitly designed to learn from the mistakes of existing payment networks. Bitcoin does not implement chargebacks. By default, transactions are irreversible, but if buyer and seller agree they can include a third party dispute mediator into a suspended transaction. This mediator is not an escrow agency and does not hold the money at any point. Rather, in the case of dispute they can select a winner. If there is no dispute, they need do nothing at all and the payment will be cleared as normal. The use of this technique is rare in 2013 due to the lack of easy to use graphical interfaces for it, however simplicity will likely improve in due course.Flexibility and specialisation. By separating the act of settling a dispute from the act of processing a payment, Bitcoin allows buyers and sellers to agree on any mutually satisfying choice of mediator. By avoiding the need to trust the mediator to hold the money, the market for mediation services becomes more competitive and fluid. Specialised trades can be mediated by individual domain experts or small businesses. Ordinary every day trades, like selling some second hand goods in person, can be handled by larger companies that may be able to have agents on the ground. Over time, mediators will arise that draft their own quality standards, and they will compete on the fairness and justice of their procedures.Incentives to develop security. Bitcoin is already significantly more secure than existing card networks because you do not hand out any credentials or steal-able identity details to make payments. But by preventing users from pushing the costs of hacking onto merchants (who can do nothing about it), Bitcoin also incentivises the creation of a market for innovative security products that explore the balance between convenience and protection. For example, users may prefer to keep a small amount of money on their smartphone with no password or PIN at all, for quick access. They may place larger sums into specialised hardware devices that are specifically hardened against viruses and hackers. They may choose to deposit their bitcoins with a third party that handles security and indemnifies them against loss. Whatever the consumers preference, there can and will be a product that satisfies them.Efficiency and low cost. Many transactions in practice do not need a third party mediator because the business itself is capable of satisfactorily resolving disputes. Major supermarket chains, for instance, will typically choose to please all but the most unreasonable customers rather than take the hit to their reputation. By avoiding the often inappropriate and expensive chargeback mechanism these businesses can reduce their overheads and pass those savings on to consumers. The website bitcoinstore.com is a successful example of this - they manage to undercut even Amazon by accepting payments only in Bitcoin thus saving money on fraud management, yet it is difficult to find an unhappy customer.Conclusion. By using sophisticated cryptographic technology, Bitcoin separates the act of clearing a payment from the act of mediating disputes. This is a superior approach that will create entirely new ecosystems of entrepreneurial mediation firms that compete on the quality not only of their consumer protection, but also their merchant protection. Innovative security mechanisms will protect users from hacking and theft. Indeed, many examples of such products already exist. "

They found that Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info both mixed coins properly and the result was untraceable. I would recommend using either one of these two, whichever is your preference after doing some more research into them. Here's some basic info to get you started:  Bitcoin Fog is .onion-hosted, which means that nobody knows who runs it, so it could be run by a nefarious person or government agency (-1). But if it's indeed run in the anonymous way that it's described, then it has the benefit that it can't be subpoenaed, raided or snooped on by anyone (+1) except the NSA if they really cared.  Blockchain.info is run by well-known and trusted individuals (+1) and the code is open source and reviewable (+1), but it can be NSL'd by the USGOV or potentially hacked or spied upon by the NSA (-1).",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Amnesic","220","2013-10-10T13:40:25","-WARNING- safe-mail.net, not so safe","Discussion/Security","Safe-mail.net is one of several e-mail services that offer to provide secure, encrypted, web-based e-mail service to general public. The idea seems to be that people who would not be willing to take the fairly short amount of time to learn to use PGP encryption would be able to secure their e-mail by trusting a third party, in this case the folks at Safe-mail.net.  We reject that idea on several grounds. First, the company that provides Internet services for hosting the Safe-mail.net system is Barak.net.il, based on our review of the domain registration for Safe-mail.net. Barak.net.il is one of three companies with a license from the Israeli government for providing similar Internet services, according to the English-language version of their web site, as we understand it. Perhaps it is merely a coincidence that Ehud Barak was once head of the Israeli Defense Forces intelligence branch.  Second, the Safe-mail.net system is âan IP trap.â Our anonymous friend indicates that your IP address is linked to your e-mail account. The user agreement indicates that it is a violation of the user agreement to employ an anonymous proxy or otherwise attempt to mask your true IP address. So, while no identifying information (name, address, phone) is requested when you set up an account, your IP address may be traced to your physical location, or at least to your specific Internet Service Provider, even if dynamic IP addresses are used. Thus, your location and possibly your identity would be exposed. Also, IP addresses are not stripped from e-mails you send from your Safe-mail account, so your recipients see this information. (And, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)  Third, Safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. They make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. This vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. Given that Barak.net.il is licensed by the Israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the Israeli government could command that the data from all Safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of Barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, Safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. Then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the Israeli government.  We found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with Safe-mail.net. An investigation of Israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by Israeli authorities. So, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the Israeli government. We donât have anything against the Israeli government that we donât also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.  It is widely known that Israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. For example, if a USA government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a Safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the Israeli government.  While it is impossible to know whether or not Safe-mail.net accounts are âMossad-transparentâ or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the Mossad, or others within the Israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. We have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that Safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.  There is always free meat in a bear trap. Be careful. Always use PGP.",""

Just that, as it has been said countless times, USE PGP and DON'T GET FOOLED by a false sense of security (ie. 'encrypted' doesn't mean shit when there's a backdoor). A LOT of users are still communicating through these services without taking the time to protect themselves. Law enforcement officers are obviously actively monitoring the old SR forums and this one also.   When everything collapsed, vendors and buyers all jumped on the forums to share their safe-mail addresses in an attempt to continue business as usual. This most probably resulted in flooded inboxes and I'm more than sure some customers/vendors were on such a rush that they decided not to or forgot to use PGP as to process things faster. Law enforcement agencies (NSA, FBI, etc.) can then just ask safe-mail to hand over the emails and IPs of those addresses that were posted and then track them down. This is just an hypothesis and I hope people realized that our methods of doing business are not completely fail-proof.   Again, just stay safe.",""

Russia has banned digital currency Bitcoin under existing laws and dubbed use of the crypto-currency as ""suspicious"".  The Central Bank of Russia considers Bitcoin as a form of ""money substitute"" or ""money surrogate"" which is restricted under Russian law. However, unlike use of restricted foreign currencies, Bitcoin has been outright banned.  Reports claim some Bitcoin exchanges in the country have shut doors following the announcement overnight by the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation.  The announcement relates to transactions of Bitcoins, but the legality of owning the currency is currently unclear.  Bitcoins allowed users to anonymously purchase goods and services online, a feat which has concerned law enforcement authorities.  Bitcoins can be used to purchase everything from steak to sports cars, but also gave rise to a thriving black market most illustrated by the infamous drug store Silk Road, which after years of operation was recently shuttered by the FBI.  Use of the crypto-currency has been banned outright in China and Kazakhstan, in Iceland for foreign trading, and potentially Thailand, but appears to be embraced across the United States, Britain, Brazil and the European Union.  Central regulatory authorities in many other countries have said there were no plans to attempt to regulate the currency.  Last month the US Library of Congress issued a report examining the regulatory approaches national financial authorities have taken to the currency. [pdf]  Deakin University Faculty of Business and Law Professor Louis De Koker said the decision went against the trend of Western governments of embracing the currency.  ""What I find fascinating is the United States, which is normally concerned with risk, is embracing Bitcoins,"" Professor Koker said.  ""It makes me wonder whether they have cracked the crypto.""  He said the Russian ban appeared curious but not out of character for the country.  The ban has sparked interest and bemusement on Bitcoin forums with users speculating about the ability of the Russian Government to enforce its ban.

Please correct me if i'm wrong ... my understanding is that the escrow problem  is basically that a market (or a hacker) can simply steal the money in escrow.   So what are multi-sigs and how does it solve the problem ?  Thank you for your help.  Have a nice day .. and be happy.  playground. :-)",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","astor","35771","2014-04-12T13:43:01","How do multisigs solve the escrow problem ?","Discussion/Security","Multisig addresses require m-of-n signatures to release the funds. The most common implementations are 2-of-2 and 2-of-3. In the latter case, 3 people provide the private keys to one of their bitcoin addresses and use them to create the multisig address. They also exchange redeemScripts which they can use to verify that the address was created from their public key, so the buyer isn't sending his coins to a fake address completely under the market's or vendor's control. After the buyer sends coins to the address, someone, usually the vendor, creates a raw transaction to spend the coins, sending them to a regular address that he controls and perhaps sending a commission to the escrow agent. 2 of the 3 parties must sign the transaction and then it is broadcast to the network as the coins having been spent (moved to other addresses).  The 2-of-3 type of multisig is nice because it involved an independent third party, the escrow agent, to resolve disputes. If he decides in the vendor's favor, they don't need the buyer's signature to spend the coins in the address. The escrow agent and vendor sign the transaction and that satisfies the 2-of-3 requirement. The escrow agent (or market) can't steal the coins without the collusion of one of the other parties. Anyone who compromises the escrow agent and gets his private key can't steal the coins either, at least not without the collusion of one other party.  It also allows for auto-finalization. If the buyer disappears then the escrow agent and vendor can sign the transaction to finalize the order..",""

In information provided to The Times earlier this year under the Freedom of Information Act, the Postal Service said that from 2001 through 2012, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies made more than 100,000 requests to monitor the mail of Americans. That would amount to an average of some 8,000 requests a year â far fewer than the nearly 50,000 requests in 2013 that the Postal Service reported in the audit. ... The difference is that the Postal Service apparently did not provide to The Times the number of surveillance requests made for national security investigations or those requested by its own investigation and law enforcement arm, the Postal Inspection Service. Typically, the inspection service works hand in hand with outside law enforcement agencies that have come to the Postal Service asking for investigations into fraud, pornography, terrorism or other potential criminal activity. ... Using information gleaned from letters and packages sent to Ms. Wilcox and her husband, Mr. Arpaio and Mr. Thomas obtained warrants for banking and other information about two restaurants the couple owned. The sheriffâs office also raided a company that hired Ms. Wilcox to provide concessions at the local airport. ... âWe lost the contract we had for the concession at the airport, and the investigation into our business scared people away from our restaurants,â Ms. Wilcox said in an interview. âI donât blame the Postal Service, but you shouldnât be able to just use these mail covers to go on a fishing expedition. There needs to be more control.â ... In another instance, Cynthia Orr, a defense lawyer in San Antonio, recalled that while working on a pornography case in the early 2000s,  federal prosecutors used mail covers to track communications between her team of lawyers and a client who was facing obscenity and tax evasion charges. Ms. Orr complained to prosecutors but never learned if the tracking stopped. Her team lost the case.  ",""

German public broadcaster ARD said two Tor servers in Germany were actively being watched by the US spy agency.  Citing information given by official sources, ARD said almost anyone searching for Tor or installing it could be watched by the NSA.  Tor hides users' location and identity by randomly bouncing data through some of the machines making up the network.  Data is encrypted during the hops to better conceal who is visiting which page.  Information passed to ARD suggests the NSA has tapped into traffic to and from two German directory servers used by Tor to scoop up the IP addresses of people who visited it.  Data passing in and out of these servers was vulnerable because it was unencrypted. Other directory servers might also have been watched.  The addresses the NSA grabbed were monitored via an analysis system it developed called XKeyscore, said ARD. XKeyscore works by snooping on information passing through the few exchanges around the world where data hops from one ISP to another.  Data grabbed from these sources was used to build up a a profile of the web browsing habits associated with those IP addresses.  Sites offering several other anonymising and privacy tools were also watched, said the ARD report.  ""XKeyscore is an analytic tool that is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system,"" a spokeswoman for the NSA told news site Ars Technica. ""Such tools have stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels.  ""All of NSA's operations are conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law,"" she said.      **TAKING FROM BBC NEWS TECHNOLOGY **",""

You could theoretically connect to your VPN, then a proxy server (should also be paid, and anon) to funnel that traffic through, then connect to tor. So that would essentially require two separate subpoenas hopefully outside your home country for investigators to have to get through before seeing that your using tor. Though it would likely be very slow and an unneccessary precaution for most. Just use tor properly, keep it updated, and don't be stupid. You can even try the 'hiding in plain sight' route by configuring a relay which would hypothetically make your own illegal traffic indistinguishable from everything else coming through, and could give you some reasonable wiggle room if ever questioned or looked at.   ",""

(Copied from Shroomey Post)   ""Another Sloppy Security Blunder Takes Down Another Dark Web Drug Emporium""      slate.com  By Justin Peters  Itâs been a bad month for people who like to buy illegal drugs online. Just a few weeks after the illicit marketplace Silk Road got shut down by the feds, one of that siteâs main Dark Web competitors is closing down as well. The proprietor of Black Market Reloadedâwhich Bitcoin Magazine has described as a Silk Road for âpeople with no moral restrictions at allââannounced Thursday that he was shutting the site. The reason: Heâd made a sloppy decision that may have compromised his real-world identityâwhich is pretty much exactly what the FBI says happened to Ross William Ulbricht, the guy who allegedly ran Silk Road.  Hereâs what seems to have happened. As you might imagine, Black Market Reloaded was deluged with new users in the wake of the Silk Road seizure, and the siteâs owner, âbackopy,â apparently had to acquire new servers to keep the site up and running under this increased demand. In a forum post published today under the title âThe end of the road,â backopy wrote that he decided to use a virtual private server, or VPS, in order to meet demand. While you can get a VPS up and running faster than a dedicated physical server, the VPS will be less secure, in part because it is not wholly controlled by the site owner. Sure enough, as backopy wrote, the VPS administrator allegedly leaked the Black Market Reloaded source code. From that code, a careful investigator could have theoretically determined backopyâs identity, and possibly more. With the site compromised, backopy apparently decided to shut it down.  As a frequent evaluator of dumbness, I feel confident in my assessment that this was even dumber than the mistakes that allegedly sank Silk Road. Ross William Ulbrichtâs alleged slip-ups came in the siteâs early days, before Silk Road became a billion-dollar business. They were novice mistakes made by a novice manager. But Black Market Reloaded has been around awhile, and the siteâs administrator should have known the risks of using a VPS. In this case, he actively chose to ignore safety in favor of expedience.  Sites like these promise safety in anonymityâthat itâs a security feature when nobody really knows who theyâre dealing with. But, as weâre learning, âyou donât know who youâre dealing withâ can also be a huge negative when you donât really know whether that person is taking the appropriate security precautions. And I guess you could argue that total security is always an illusion in cases like theseâthat as a site scales in size and popularity, it becomes harder to manage, and leads to more opportunities for a breach. Creating a digital trail is always fraught, no matter how well that trail is supposedly concealed or encrypted. That, to me, seems more convincing than the idea that these sites couldâve gone on forever if the creators werenât big dummies.  Anyway, there are still several Dark Web marketplaces out there, and backopy himself has already promised that he will ""come back in the future"" with a new, safer version of the site. (Hooray?) Iâm eager to see whether he and the other remaining proprietors have learned any lessons from Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded, or whether they, too, will fall in the wake of some digital blunder.     This sucks!!!was about to place an order!!! Hope SR 2.0 is up and running soon...anyone have any idea how long that might be??",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","462","2013-10-13T03:58:10","Tails to USB for MAC/OSX","Discussion/Security"," Its always a good idea to verify the signature/checksum on the disk you are trying to boot from. Errors happen from time to time. Sometimes even a perfectly good Live CD/DVD will not boot on a Mac. But keep trying, it will boot eventually.   Macs have some sort of issue with the display, and it causes problems when trying to boot into Linux off a live CD. I've had this happen when booting Ubuntu and Tails on a Mac. Just keep trying tho. It will boot eventually. Sometimes it takes me 5 or 6 reboots to get that Mac booted into Linux.   On the issue of booting from USB, I've read that it can be done, but I have not been able to do it. I've tried the rEFIt trick and everything else I've read about, and its still a no go. But there's a good workaround for that. You can boot off the Tails Live DVD, and use an encrypted USB stick as storage. You won't be able to have persistence, so any system settings you tweak will be restored back to the default every time you reboot. Its a minor pain in the ass, but its actually safer to do it this way, in the long run. In the unlikely event that you contract some sort of virus or malware, it will be wiped from your system on the next reboot as well.

You might have to install rEFIt (a program which loads a boot screen instead of directly starting up the OS on the HD so you can choose from multiple OS boots from your HD partitions).

I am still a bit confused about the whole verifying/signature system though. Is creating a signature worth it? Even if I plan on just a few small buys? Thanks again I also believe safety and security to be important.I was just illustrating what a signature was, and how to use it.  I have long held that one should sign nothingA PGP signed statement, once it verifies, cannot later be disavowed or repudiated. When you sign something, and the signature verifies, you lose ALL plausible deniability.

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive. Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass. The original DPR is the poster child for that, right now."

I've heard Localbitcoin but when I select Cash Deposit there are no people offering this.  I have also read some blog suggesting swapping it to EUR then transfering to TransferWise then from there to a BTC Marketplace? ***CLEARNET http://www.bitcoinuk.blogspot.co.uk/ ***  ","Buying bitcoins in United Kingdom can be very hard... since Intersango is not to be trusted and blockchain.info & MtGox stoped receiving GBP deposits.Thats why I would recommend this service -> TransferWise(this refferal url will get you 1 free transfer.)You will be able to deposit on:Bitstamp (recommended)MtGoxBitcoin24Bitcoin-Central(and every other Exchange that accepts SEPA deposits)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How to get GBP into BTC (on BitStamp) :(this is the cheapest way to buy bitcoins in uk atm, but you are free to find other alternatives.. pls post them in the comments)To get GBP into BTC we may still want an exchange; this post uses the BitStamp exchange (BS) primarily because they seem to focus on Europe, and also because I've seen good things, but finally because I've used them once and been happy with them.We cannot directly send GBP to BS as they don't have a UK bank account. UK bank accounts appear to be difficult for some reason: look at blockchain.info who stopped allowing cash deposits at their Barclays account, and now disallow any kind of transfer in.So in order to get money to BS, we first need to convert GBP into EUR. I'm going to do this with TransferWise (TW), primarily because they give much better rates.What will happen is this: we deposit GBP into TW's UK bank account. Somebody wanting GBP in return for EUR does the same into TW's European account. TW will swap the two around: we can then use the other people's EUR, and the other people can use our GBP. For this, TW get a 0.48% cut. We then tell TW to send our EUR to BS, using SEPA.BS use USD for trading, so our EUR needs to be converted first. Why do we convert GBP into EUR, and not directly into USD? Because EUR can be transferred by SEPA for free, taking 1-3 days, whereas it would cost another 0.1% and take 2-5 days if we used USD directly.BS accepts the EUR into our account, converting the EUR into USD. For this, BS get a 0.5% cut. Finally, we can use the USD at BS to buy BTC into our wallet there, then forward it from our wallet to wherever we like.When TransferWise convert our GBP into EUR, they do it at mid-market rates. Mid-market rates mean that we don't lose anything converting the one currency into another.When BitStamp convert EUR into USD, they do it at corporate rates. This means we do lose a little bit in the exchange, but very little.I've done it this way once so far, and it took just under 48 hours to complete."

Description:PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the ApacheHTTP Server.It was found that PHP did not properly handle file names with a NULLcharacter. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a PHPscript access unexpected files and bypass intended file system accessrestrictions. (CVE-2006-7243)It was found that PHP did not check for carriage returns in HTTP headers,allowing intended HTTP response splitting protections to be bypassed.Depending on the web browser the victim is using, a remote attacker coulduse this flaw to perform HTTP response splitting attacks. (CVE-2011-1398)A flaw was found in PHP's SSL client's hostname identity check whenhandling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. If anattacker was able to get a carefully crafted certificate signed by atrusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the certificate toconduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers.

It can be a pain but it's the way to do things.  Be careful out there.","EE, Vodafone and Three give police mobile call records at click of a mouseThree of UKâs big four mobile phone networks are providing customer data to police forces automatically through Ripa;Three of the UKâs four big mobile phone networks have made customersâ call records available at the click of a mouse to police forces through automated systems, a Guardian investigation has revealed.EE, Vodafone and Three operate automated systems that hand over customer data âlike a cash machineâ,as one phone company employee described it.Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, a transparency watchdog, said: âIf companies are providing communications data to law enforcement on automatic pilot, itâs as good as giving police direct access [to individual phone bills].âO2, by contrast, is the only major phone network requiring staff to review all police information requests, the company said.Mobile operators must by law store a year of call records of all of their customers, which police forces and other agencies can then access without a warrant using the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).Ripa is the interception law giving authority to much of GCHQâs mass surveillance. The law was again under the spotlight recently after it was used to identify sources of journalists from at least two national newspapers, the Sun and the Mail on Sunday.Documents from software providers and conversations with mobile companies staff reveal how automatic this system has become, with the âvast majorityâ of records demanded by police delivered through automated systems, without the involvement of any phone company staff.The Home Office argues communications data is âa critical toolâ and its use of Ripa was ânecessary and proportionateâ.Despite politiciansâ assurances that the UK laws requiring phone companies to keep records would not create a state database of private communications, critics argue that the practice comes very close to doing so. King warned that âwidespread, automatic access of this natureâ meant the UK telecoms industry âessentially already provides law enforcement with the joined-up databases they claimed they didnât have when pushing for the âsnooperâs charterâ.âIn the automated systems used by the phone companies, police officers seeking phone records must gain permission from another officer on the same force, who then enters the details into an online form. That mirrors the US Prism programme, revealed by Edward Snowden, which in effect created a backdoor into the products of US tech corporations. In the vast majority of cases, the information is then delivered without any further human role.One document prepared by Charter Systems, which sells the type of software used by police forces to connect with mobile phone companies, explains the automated process saves â32 minutesâ of human time per application.âCharter Systems have worked in partnership with the Home Office and Detica [a firm providing data interception for security services and the police, now called BAE Systems Applied Intelligence].to develop a solution that links directly to all CSPs [communication service providers, a term covering phone companies],â it states. The document explains the system produces âan automated solution for gathering electronic data information. The new solution saves time and effort for the authority in requesting and receiving ever increasing amounts of data.âThe systems were so interconnected, a separate sales document produce by Charter reveals, that â[d]ata can be retrieved from multiple CSPs in one requestâ.Privacy groups reacted angrily to the details of how little day-to-day scrutiny records requests receive, warning that the automation of the system removes even the limited oversight ability â the right to refer requests to oversight agencies â phone networks have over Ripa requests.âWe urgently need clarity on just how unquestioning the relationship between telecommunications companies and law enforcement has become,â said King. âItâs crucial that each individual warrant for communications data is independently reviewed by the companies who receive them and challenged where appropriate to ensure the privacy of their customers is not being inappropriately invaded.âPrivacy advocates are also concerned that the staff within phone companies who deal with Ripa and other requests are often in effect paid by the Home Office â a fact confirmed by several networks â and so may, in turn, be less willing to challenge use of surveillance powers.Several mobile phone networks confirmed the bulk of their queries were handled without human intervention. âWe do have an automated system,â said a spokesman for EE, the UKâs largest network, which also operates Orange and T-Mobile. â[T]he vast majority of Ripa requests are handled through the automated system.â The spokesman added the system was subject to oversight, with monthly reports being sent to the law enforcement agency requesting the data, and annual reports going to the interception commissioner and the Home Office.A spokesman for Vodafone said the company processed requests in a similar way. âThe overwhelming majority of the Ripa notices we receive are processed automatically in accordance with the strict framework set out by Ripa and underpinned by the code of practice,â he said. âEven with a manual process, we cannot look behind the demand to determine whether it is properly authorised.âA spokesman for Three, which is also understood to use a largely automated system, said the company was simply complying with legal requirements. âWe take both our legal obligations and customer privacy seriously,â he said. âThree works with the government and does no more or less than is required or allowed under the established legal framework.âUnlike the other networks, O2 said it did manually review all of its Ripa requests. âWe have a request management system with which the law enforcement agencies can make their requests to us,â said the O2 spokeswoman. âAll O2 responses are validated by the disclosure team to ensure that each request is lawful and the data provided is commensurate with the request.Mike Harris, director of the Donât Spy On Us campaign, said the automated systems posed a serious threat to UK freedom of expression. âHow do we know that the police through new Home Office systems arenât making automated requests that reveal journalistâs sources or even the private contacts of politicians?â he said.âEdward Snowden showed that both the NSA and GCHQ had backdoor access to our private information stored on servers. Now potentially the police have access too, when will Parliament stand up and protect our fundamental civil liberties?âA spokesman for the Home Office declined to respond to specific queries about the use of automatic systems to retrieve call records, but defended police forcesâ use of Ripa. âCommunications data is an absolutely critical tool used by police and other agencies to investigate crime, preserve national security and protect the public,â he said in a statement.âThis data is stored by communications service providers themselves and can only be acquired by public authorities under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 on a case by case basis, and where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.âThe acquisition of communications data under RIPA is subject to stringent safeguards in existing legislation and is independently overseen by the Interception of Communications Commissioner.â"

Tails is meant to be amnestic, so in order to prevent it from leaving traces of its usage on your computer this is absolutely necessary to make your HDD inacessible.   Running Tails in a virtual machine is possible but is advised against as there could be security issues. If your host OS is compromised, you're screwed.  What you could do in order to access your existing PGP keyring is to create a persistent volume using Tails. Then, after booting back into your regular OS, mount the encrypted volume you created in Tails. Export your PGP keyring, your private key etc. using your regular PGP program. Copy everything relevant to the persistent volume.  After booting back into your Tails live system with persistent volume activated you should be able to import your PGP data into Tails' PGP-application. Now you should be able to encrypt/decrypt messages again by using the OpenPGP encryption applet in Tails. However, I do not know what operating system and PGP software you were using before trying Tails. There might be compatibility issues and even concerns regarding security. So the paranoid way to go about the situation would be to start over and create new keys using Tails. But if you feel confident that there will be no security or compatibilty problems, it might be worth trying. Refer to the official documentation for further information. Hope I could help.  ",""

A lot of people just keep the necessary files on a flashdrive or something instead of their HDD. It's much safer that way.

LE already knows this method as it has been used since before 90% of the people on this forum were born.   I will tell you it in a story:  Many, many years ago before currency exchange places were abundant, people wanted to bring more than 10,000 worth of currency into the country. At this time you could fly with gels, liquids and whatnot. They would take a tub of miricle whip or margerine or other thick substance and hid their money in there. They would take a few spoonfuls out and place money in plasic bags in. This is also how people consealed large sums of money to bring to Swizerland. This can be applied with sunscreen on a cruise.   Now this was when security was relaxed. Now they usually do not allow larger amounts of liquid traveling. This does not include cruise ships though. Since you can bring sunscreen (and lots of it) your best bet is to find a way to get a bottle of sunscreen and put your molly in a small plastic bag and deposit them in there. most bottles will be impossible to fit a bag in because there is no big opening with a screw off cap. But you know that one brand with the kid on the beach for the label? That still has a big opening in the bigger bottles.    For the green it is a different story unless you are bringing small quantities.  For larger quantities I am stumped.    This is assuming it is very tight security as some cruises are. Some are not though.",""

Insert packaged drugs at bottom (remember, the bag/canister that your drugs are in should be airtight, both to counter security and to avoid pringle contamination.)

Now, i'm not saying to take your OPSEC lightly, but let's keep things in perspective here. You are getting on a cruise ship, not an airplane, so security is nowhere near as stringent. Since all you will have to do is walk through a metal detector, your person will not be searched, so anything on you that's not metal, is getting on the ship no problem. The tricky part is getting off, where you will have to pass through customs, where you could absolutely be searched, simple solution to this is to have nothing when you disembark.

Make sure you ONLY have the mdma caps, and not a mixture of melatonin and mdma caps. There is a noticeable color difference that could tip off security should they open the bottle (melatonin is bright white, finely ground mdma is light tan).  ***that person*** got a travel size (30 capsule) bottle of melatonin gel caps, threw out 20 of them, and filled 10 with finely ground mdma. Security didn't even open the bottle, as it is tiny and looks innocent, and you could just say you need it to sleep if questioned anyway. I guarantee the cruiseliners do not equip their security with reagent tests at boarding.   next topic: weed - WAY harder and more risky  i would recommend bringing edibles such as cheeba chews or lollipops, things you can just pass off as candy you have in your bag. DO. NOT. TRY. TO. BRING. ACTUAL. BUDS. the smell, bulk, and difficulty of finding a place to blaze is too much hassle and risk.   Best of luck sir!",""

This is a great way to get them into clubs also, and makes it easy to access in the bathroom. You can also pull the bags off one by one if your pin is strong enough.  BUT, the SAFE is the best spot.

MJ/Pills/Powder  Go to your local crafts store. They always carry these stupid clear tubes that can hold quarters and such. they are a single sided open cylinder with cap. Take the cap off, usually has some kind of pull tab on it. Cut or burn off. Grind your MJ/Pills/Powder all the way down. Shove about an inch of product in, take a quarter and put the quarter in the tube. Now you are going to take anything thats long enough and small enough to push the quarter down in to compact the product for minimum space [I use a marker they work best] Now really shove that quarter in there, bud should have resin collecting on the bottom and pill/powder should be forming into a solid hard rock. Repeat the step until you have all contraband in the tube. To fill the tube with more than 1 substance you are going to fill up first with MJ, then take any flexible bag and fill with your powder/pills. So you should have raw bud on the bottom, then add your baggy. Make sure your bag has no air in it or it will explode. Replace cap, take electrical tape and go ham. Make sure you tape around the cylinder first, then up and down, and around once more. Condom wrap it twice from each end. Now you can either lube up, lady friend, or put into a shampoo bottle. Another way is to take soap, candles, etc hollow them out, place contraband, and melt the item back together taking a knife to smooth out any rough edges.  Keep in mind tho, if it's going through an xray the best thing to do is just go home. it's hard to beat xrays man, trust me. Even, evenly distributing the drugs and masking them doesn't work. They are trained to spot these, by proffessional smugglers. They know what's up with the xray game.",""

It isn't possible to do as much with it as you can with Tor servers, since it is actually a content store instead of a transport layer for a webserver, but it really is far superior in almost every other way. It is essentially impossible to take a Freenet site down due to it being spread out over potentially thousands of different computers. It is also essentially impossible to hack a Freenet site, just as you cannot really hack an MP3 being seeded on a torrent network. Tracing Freenet sites is not really possible due to the fact that they don't really have a single location but rather are spread out around a massive network. Even if you find one of the nodes with part of the site, the same part is probably on dozens of other nodes,and the node you found probably has nothing to do with the site being hosted. The more popular freenet sites are the faster they load, and it is pretty much impossible to DDoS them, if you keep loading a freenet site over and over from a million different nodes you are just going to make it faster and faster for the other people trying to access it. The only way to DDoS a freenet site is to DDoS the ~20,000 node strong Freenet network.  I am not saying Freenet is perfect or anything, but although Tor is the low latency anonymity champ, I think it is pretty clear that Freenet is the hidden website champ*  *If you can get around the fact that the hidden website isn't like a normal website, and that if you want to do anything that mimics a normal website you will need custom client side software made just for it.   **oh yeah, also, even with custom client side software, you are not going to have the full functionality of a hidden service (be it I2P or Tor)...you can just get closer to it.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","fuckingfedsandnoobsohmy","68","2013-10-16T03:40:41","Hidden Server Hardening","Discussion/Security","You couldn't run a site exactly like the old SR on Tor. I don't think you can possibly have a Freesite that manages bitcoins, for example. Freenet is really limited to the types of sites it can host. You can get by some of these limitations with custom software, for example there is Forum and E-mail software specifically for Freenet that manages to work with it. But some of the issues you will not be able to get by, so even with custom software you cannot do as much with Freenet as you can with Tor or I2P. The nicest part about Tor and I2P is that it is a transport network, you can set up whatever you want to work with it, a regular webserver for the millions of scripts out there, an IRC server or client, a bitcoin client or server, really pretty much anything. Freenet is vastly more limited than this. By itself it is more like an anonymous filesharing network than anything. You can insert files anonymously and receive them anonymously, due in large part to its plausible deniability system. Tor and I2P anonymize services (IRC, webserver, etc), content then needs to be put on the servers. Freenet anonymizes content, services then need to be built that can work with this (custom E-mail program that uses Freenet, custom Forum software that uses Freenet). But the services Freenet can support are purely information transmitting ones, not processing ones. For example, you can have custom software that implements a forum using Freenet, but you are never going to be able to have a Freesite that can store bitcoins in escrow. There is nowhere to run the Bitcoin program. You could host a wallet on Freenet, but never actually do anything with it while it is hosted, other than download it. This is the biggest downside to Freenet when it comes to hosting sites. By default you are really limited as to what you can actually host (ie: you can't host a PHP forum), and even if you spend the considerable time required to make custom programs to get around this, you can only get so far (ie: you can make a custom forum software that uses Freenet, but you will never be able to run Bitcoin on a Freenet site).   Besides these downsides though, Freenet is really by far the best network for anonymous sites. It is essentially immune to hacking, DDOS, take down of any sort, etc. Even if you have the professional level skills required to secure a Tor or I2P hidden service, they can still be traced and taken down, they can still be DDoSed, the person running them can still be busted or die and the hosting bill never get paid and the full site come down. Even professionals end up having their servers hacked every now and then. If you try to DDoS a Freenet site you are wasting your time because you are only going to make it load faster. You can't really hack a Freenet site, the best you could do is hack the Freenet software itself, which is hopefully hard and probably illegal for the feds to do. You can't really trace a Freenet site because it doesn't exist at any specific location, it is spread out in bits and pieces over dozens or hundreds or thousands of locations. Taking down some of the servers where it is hosted wont have any significant effect on it, and would be a waste of time anyway considering the people hosting content are not the people putting the content they host out there. These are enormous benefits and I think that they largely outweigh the cons.   The only real issue with Freenet is that only 20,000 or so people use it. If everybody who used SR started using Freenet, it would be pretty easy to tell that there is a very high probability that any given Freenet node is using Freenet to get drugs. Freenet has a mode that attempts membership concealment and it isn't trivial to enumerate all Freenet clients if they run in Darknet Mode after initially getting some 'guards' in Open Net Mode. But I don't think Freenet is the right option for a large drug market. It is the right option for the site, but it is the wrong option for the clients. Unfortunately, to access a Freenet site, you generally need to use a Freenet client. I suppose a possibility would be to have the main site on Freenet and then have several independently run Tor hidden services that act as gateways. The main site would be impossible to take down, and as gateways are taken down new ones could be put up. But using gateways like this seems to kind of go against having custom software, so you will be significantly limited in regards to the features the site can have.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","68","2013-10-14T13:30:49","Hidden Server Hardening","Discussion/Security","And that's the million dollar question, right there.   Nobody has a good answer, but everybody has opinions.     OpenBSD is a weird animal.. it's basically a 90's fork of NetBSD that has evolved VERY slowly and cautiously over nearly twenty years.  They don't add new features often, and they don't buy in to newfangled concepts like MAC extensions, virtualzation, etc.  But the net result is well-audited, stable code, and it's sorta the opposite of Linux and FreeBSD from that perspective.  They don't seem to introduce new bugs very often, because they don't seem to introduce new code very often.. they spend their time auditing their code and bragging about how secure they are.    If you run a server on OpenBSD, you're making the bet that the OS is more free from vulnerabilities, and if the other code you're running is also free of them, you're in good shape.  But if someone breaks out of that third party code you installed, the only container they're in is a (probably very well implemented) chroot jail, and a well-built traditional UNIX box.  It should be harder for them to get local root on the OpenBSD box than on a FreeBSD or Linux one, all other things being equal.   But root isn't the primary worry for a hidden service -- deanonymization is.  OpenBSD usually works and plays poorly with virtualization, especially with its mp kernels as OpenBSD guests.   It doesn't support any host virutalization outside of raw qemu that I'm aware of.  FreeBSD has an advanced jails functionality that seems to work well for compartmented hosting for clearnet servers.   I've never tried setting up private network isolation in FreeBSD jails.. I looked at it a while back, and it seemed like it involved a fairly new (i.e. untested) bridge driver and virtual networking.  Maybe I'm way off base here.. I'd love to hear from anybody that has tried setting it up how well it works.     Freedom Hosting was running FreeBSD when Anonymous compromised their server a few years in OpDarknet, and they posted some pastebins of the server.  It looked like they were stuck in a jail and were unable to deanonymize the server effectively.  I'm unclear as to whether that was because the server was using physical isolation, a virtual isolation with FreeBSD jails networking, or the OS was virtualized..  I don't think they thought to try to get at the hardware for identifying information from BIOS,etc.  I would guess that Freedom Hosting was residing on rented dedicated servers at OVH's French datacenter, based on some of the other things I've read.  If that's the case, it was probably virtual isolation, unless he had OVH run a dedicated network between a couple of his boxes instead of connecting some to the public network.    Regardless, it looked from the pastebins like they were unable to identify jack shit.  So somebody claiming to be Anonymous ended up doing the world's worst frame-up job on Mike Perry of the Tor project, which is hilarious reading, BTW.  I feel sorry for him, the whole episode was retarded.  FH's owner also posted on one of the server-hosting forums quite a bit, and his past posts are worth a read.  Don't have them handy, but somebody can't find them with a quick search, lemme know and I'll find them and post a link.  The biggest core problem at an OS level is that nobody (outside of people building hidden services) views obtaining a server's network information and real IPs as a significant event.  With hidden services, deanonymizing the box is usually an exposure that far outweighs an attacker simply getting root on the box.   Which is why everybody ends up relying on virtualization.  It provides a layer to cover the hardware deanonymization (i.e. running lspci and dmidecode on a rooted Linux box), and it provides a layer to cover the network isolation.  It almost certainly presents a larger attack surface than OpenBSD on physical hardware and isolation, but since the prime risk is deanonymization, I think virtualization is probably the best bet.  Especially on rented dedicated servers, where private, isolated physical networking might not be an option.    On that topic, if somebody decides to rely on a provider's private network for physical isolation, if it's not a crossover cable between two boxes, they should probably spend some time sniffing that VLAN to see if they're getting what they think they are.   Because that ""private network"" is probably loaded with CDP messages and other traffic that contains real MAC addresses or IPs from other provider customers.    Most importantly, if that segment is between a server and the Tor instance for an unencrypted protocol like HTTP, it contains all the unencrypted traffic to the hidden service.  So you'd want to encrypt that between the two nodes. ","Is DAC sufficient?  Is OpenBSD appropriate for a web service, or would FreeBSD be a better choice?"
"Silk Road 2 Forums","fuckingfedsandnoobsohmy","68","2013-10-16T00:40:17","Hidden Server Hardening","Discussion/Security","Honestly though so many things can go wrong with hidden service that you should just forget about hosting a hidden service that cannot be traced. You can make it harder and harder to trace a hidden service, but unless you literally hack the Tor code you are only buying yourself time. Even if you hack the Tor code you are probably fucked with a very popular hidden service. Guess what, all Tor nodes advertise how much bandwidth they use in a given 15 minute time frame. This is publicly accessable information. Normally the entropy of the network adds so much noise that this information isn't useful. But for a super popular hidden service, it can cause the entry guards to have a noticeable spike in traffic that is statistically identifiable. If you have the most popular hidden service on Tor, its entry guards are going to be handling more traffic than most nodes on Tor, and you are going to be able to find them just by looking for the nodes that handle the most traffic. This is particularly shitty because it makes hacking Tor to layer entry guards less effective, since you are just going to result in a set of nodes with similarly spiked traffic. You might not be able to tell the first layer guards from the second layer guards (or maybe you will be able to, but the traffic they handle will be so close to the same that I imagine the entropy of the network will mask them from each other), but you will likely be able to find all of the guard nodes.   Generally I would suggest layering the fuck out of entry guards for hidden services. For clients this isn't really important, and I highly suggest not using advanced OR or any of the other premade programs made by who knows who that let you do this. But you can edit the Tor source code to have longer paths for hidden services, and manually set to have layered guards. This can significantly increase the resistance to traffic analysis of a hidden service, which is particularly weak to traffic analysis much more so than a regular Tor client. But the guards used by really popular sites will still possibly be possible to identify due to nodes reporting how much traffic they route in a period of time, and popular hidden services entry guards routing lots more traffic than normal nodes. If they cannot tell the first layer guards from second layer guards it would still be beneficial though, but unfortunately for very popular hidden services it probably isn't as beneficial as it would be if nodes didn't report how much traffic they have routed.  You should always operate with the assumption that your hidden service is going to be deanonymized. The most you can do is make it harder or make it take longer. But in the end it is quite likely for your hidden service to be traced given enough time, even if you secure the shit out of the server and probably even if you layer entry guards.  ",""

I am pretty sure this is possible, it was in the original version of Freenet but maybe it cannot work with the new version. I think there are actually two Freenet networks right now, unless the original died. There was a split that wasn't backwards compatible I think. Before the split it worked with Tor, I think afterwards it started using UDP and therefore did not. I am not sure though. I know the theoretical information in regards to the Freenet design, but I don't know the details of its implementation. ",""

I wouldn't want to do it client side that means java http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2013/03/mongodb-security-weaknesses-in-a-typical-nosql-database.html  As for your federated and distributed strategy sure if you have 8 weeks to run 100-200 nodes 24/7 on the same IP to get steady state guard relay status https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/entry-guards but during that whole time the IPs will be discoverable and published, meaning whoever's network you broke into might notice. The Tor-talk mailing list would notice 200 new relays, so would GCHQ.   You'd have to figure out some relatively safe way to keep your hidden server private key(s) as well unless you plan on generating a new one every single time a server is lost from the pool and signing it with an original key you kept to prove it's still you running the service. You could try tunneling the tor traffic in through ssh proxy to the hidden service through your wrapper of disposable servers, and then tunnel it back out into the node pool through different servers which would probably throw off a lot of tracking. By the time they got half way through your ssh proxy you would already have dropped them from the pool and used new ones. I imagine this would be really slow.  You could technically run SR off Freenet Messaging Service. All SR does is sell trust, basically safe escrow services. The automatic little store thing was great but pointless, SR could just be this forum. DPR could sit on it all day in OTR and do escrow like the Russian's do or write a jabber bot to do it for him, and manually verify it when releasing funds.

When the public hear about SR X in the future, we need them to hear that this is not just vendors and buyers, but a community that promotes harm reduction and ultimately does not want to be treated as a criminal underground but as normal human beings. SR has already impacted the notion of gang-land street dealing when prohibition fosters its development, these are the kinds of elements the community of SR need to develop.

Just a reminder:  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/23/nation/na-swift23  U.S. Secretly Tracks Global Bank Data The Treasury Dept. program, begun after the Sept. 11 attacks, attempts to monitor terrorist financing but raises privacy concerns. June 23, 2006|Josh Meyer and Greg Miller | Times Staff Writers Email Share  WASHINGTON â The U.S. government, without the knowledge of many banks and their customers, has engaged for years in a secret effort to track terrorist financing by accessing a vast database of confidential information on transfers of money between banks worldwide.  The program, run by the Treasury Department, is considered a potent weapon in the war on terrorism because of its ability to clandestinely monitor financial transactions and map terrorist webs.   It is part of an arsenal of aggressive measures the government has adopted since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that yield new intelligence, but also circumvent traditional safeguards against abuse and raise concerns about intrusions on privacy.  Under this effort, Treasury routinely acquires information about bank transfers from the world's largest financial communication network, which is run by a consortium of financial institutions called the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT.  The SWIFT network carries up to 12.7 million messages a day containing instructions on many of the international transfers of money between banks. The messages typically include the names and account numbers of bank customers -- from U.S. citizens to major corporations -- who are sending or receiving funds.  Through the program, Treasury has built an enormous -- and ever-growing -- repository of financial records drawn from what is essentially the central nervous system of international banking.  In a major departure from traditional methods of obtaining financial records, the Treasury Department uses a little-known power -- administrative subpoenas -- to collect data from the SWIFT network, which has operations in the U.S., including a main computer hub in Manassas, Va. The subpoenas are secret and not reviewed by judges or grand juries, as are most criminal subpoenas.  ""It's hard to overstate the value of this information,"" Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said Thursday in a statement he issued after The Times and other media outlets reported the existence of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program.  SWIFT acknowledged Thursday in response to questions from The Times that it has provided data under subpoena since shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, a striking leap in cooperation from international bankers, who long resisted such law enforcement intrusions into the confidentiality of their communications.  But SWIFT said in a statement that it has worked with U.S. officials to restrict the use of the data to terrorism investigations.  The program is part of the Bush administration's dramatic expansion of intelligence-gathering capabilities, which includes warrantless eavesdropping on the international phone calls of some U.S. residents. Critics complain that these efforts are not subject to independent governmental reviews designed to prevent abuse, and charge that they collide with privacy and consumer protection laws in the United States.  Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, said the SWIFT program raises similar issues. ""It boils down to a question of oversight, both internal and external. And in the current circumstances, it is hard to have confidence in the efficacy of their oversight,"" he said. ""Their policy is, 'Trust us,' and that may not be good enough anymore.""   A former senior Treasury official expressed concern that the SWIFT program allows access to vast quantities of sensitive data that could be abused without safeguards. The official, who said he did not have independent knowledge of the program, questioned what becomes of the data, some of it presumably related to innocent banking customers.  ""How do you separate the wheat from the chaff?"" the former official said. ""And what do you do with the chaff?""  More than a dozen current and former U.S. officials discussed the program on condition of anonymity, citing its sensitive nature.  The effort runs counter to the expectations of privacy and security that are sacrosanct in the worldwide banking community. SWIFT promotes its services largely by touting the network's security, and most of its customers are unaware that the U.S. government has such extensive access to their private financial information.  U.S. officials, some of whom expressed surprise the program had not previously been revealed by critics, acknowledged it would be controversial in the financial community. ""It is certainly not going to sit well in the world marketplace,"" said a former counterterrorism official. ""It could very likely undermine the integrity of SWIFT.""  Bush administration officials asked The Times not to publish information about the program, contending that disclosure could damage its effectiveness and that sufficient safeguards are in place to protect the public.  Dean Baquet, editor of The Times, said: ""We weighed the government's arguments carefully, but in the end we determined that it was in the public interest to publish information about the extraordinary reach of this program. It is part of the continuing national debate over the aggressive measures employed by the government.""  Under the program, Treasury issues a new subpoena once a month, and SWIFT turns over huge amounts of electronic financial data, according to Stuart Levey, the department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. The administrative subpoenas are issued under authority granted in the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.   The SWIFT information is added to a massive database that officials have been constructing since shortly after Sept. 11. Levey noted that SWIFT did not have the ability to search its own records. ""We can, because we built the capability to do that,"" he said.  Treasury shares the data with the CIA, the FBI and analysts from other agencies, who can run queries on specific individuals and accounts believed to have terrorist connections, Levey said Thursday in an interview with The Times.  Levey said that ""tens of thousands"" of searches of the database have been done over the last five years.  The program was initially a closely guarded secret, but it has recently become known to a wider circle of government officials, former officials, banking executives and outside experts.  Current and former U.S. officials said the effort has been only marginally successful against Al Qaeda, which long ago began transferring money through other means, including the highly informal banking system common in Islamic countries.  The value of the program, Levey and others said, has been in tracking lower- and mid-level terrorist operatives and financiers who believe they have not been detected, and militant groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, that also operate political and social welfare organizations.  *  It's no secret that the Treasury Department tries to track terrorist financing, or that those efforts ramped up significantly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the SWIFT program goes far beyond what has been publicly disclosed about that effort in terms of the amount of financial data that U.S. intelligence agencies can access.  The program also represents a major tactical shift. U.S. investigators long have been able to subpoena records on specific accounts or transactions when they could show cause -- a painstaking process designed mainly for gathering evidence. But access to SWIFT enables them to follow suspicious financial trails around the globe, identifying new suspects without having to seek assistance from foreign banks.  SWIFT is a consortium founded in 1973 to replace telex messages. It has almost 7,900 participating institutions in more than 200 countries -- including Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Citibank and Credit Suisse. The network handled 2.5 billion financial messages in 2005, including many originating in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates that the United States scrutinizes closely for terrorist activity.  The system does not execute the actual transfer of funds between banks; that is carried out by the Federal Reserve and its international counterparts. Rather, banks use the network to transmit instructions about such transfers. For that reason, SWIFT's data is extremely valuable to intelligence services seeking to uncover terrorist webs.  CIA operatives trying to track Osama bin Laden's money in the late 1990s figured out clandestine ways to access the SWIFT network. But a former CIA official said Treasury officials blocked the effort because they did not want to anger the banking community.   Historically, ""there was always a line of contention"" inside the government, said Paul Pillar, former deputy director of the CIA's counterterrorism center. ""The Treasury position was placing a high priority on the integrity of the banking system. There was considerable concern from that side about anything that could be seen as compromising the integrity of international banking.""  Before Sept. 11, a former senior SWIFT executive said, providing access to its sensitive data would have been anathema to the Belgium-based consortium. But the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon led to a new mind-set in many industries, including telecommunications.  SWIFT said the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control sent the first subpoena shortly after Sept. 11, seeking ""limited sets of data"" to learn about how Al Qaeda financed the attacks.  Unlike telephone lines and e-mail communications, the SWIFT network cannot be easily tapped. It uses secure log-ins and state-of-the-art encryption technology to prevent intercepted messages from being deciphered. ""It is arguably the most secure network on the planet,"" said the former SWIFT executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This thing is locked down like Fort Knox.""  SWIFT said it was responding to compulsory subpoenas and negotiated with U.S. officials to narrow them and to establish protections for the privacy of its customers. SWIFT also said it has never given U.S. authorities direct access to its network.   ""Our fundamental principle has been to preserve the confidentiality of our users' data while complying with the lawful obligations in countries where we operate,"" SWIFT said in its statement.  *  Current and former U.S. officials familiar with the SWIFT program described it as one of the most valuable weapons in the financial war on terrorism, but declined to provide even anecdotal evidence of its successes.  A former high-ranking CIA officer said it has been a success, and another official said it has allowed U.S. counterterrorism officials to follow a tremendous number of leads. CIA officials pursue leads overseas, and the FBI and other agencies pursue leads in the United States, where the CIA is prohibited from operating.  Officials said the program is relied upon especially heavily when intelligence chatter from phone and e-mail intercepts suggested an imminent attack, conveying real-time intelligence for counterterrorism operations.  The former SWIFT executive said much can be learned from network messages, which require an actual name and address of both the sender and recipient, unlike phone calls and e-mails, in which terrorist operatives can easily disguise their identities.  ""There is a good deal of detail in there,"" he said.  As the global war on terrorism has succeeded in taking out some senior terrorists and their financiers, particularly within Al Qaeda, the organization and its many affiliates have sought to move to hidden locations and to transfer their money through proxies such as charities, aid organizations and corporate fronts.  The officials said the SWIFT information can be used in ""link analysis."" That technique allows analysts to identify any person with whom a suspected terrorist had financial dealings -- even those with no connection to terrorism. That information is then mapped and analyzed to detect patterns, shifts in strategy, specific ""hotspot"" accounts, and locations that have become new havens for terrorist activity.  *  The SWIFT program is just one of the Bush administration's post-Sept. 11 initiatives to collect intelligence that could include information on U.S. residents.  The National Security Agency, which can intercept communications around the world, is eavesdropping on the telephone calls and e-mails of some U.S. residents without obtaining warrants. And it has been accused of asking telecommunications companies to help create a database of the phone-call records of almost all Americans.  The Justice Department also has asked Internet companies to keep records of the websites customers visit and the people they e-mail for two years, rather than days or weeks, which would greatly expand the government's ability to track online activity.   Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the government and phone companies, challenging the NSA efforts. The government has asked courts to throw them out, invoking the ""state secrets"" privilege and arguing that trials would compromise national security. The NSA's interception of telephone calls also has been criticized for lacking an independent review process to ensure that the information is not abused.  The SWIFT program raises similar concerns, some critics say.  Privacy advocates have questioned ""link analysis"" because it can drag in innocent people who have routine financial dealings with terrorist suspects.  And no outside governmental oversight body, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or a grand jury, monitors the subpoenas served on SWIFT.  Levey said the program is subject to ""robust"" checks and balances designed to prevent misuse of the data. He noted that requests to access the data are reviewed by Treasury's assistant secretary for intelligence; that analysts can only access the data for terrorism-related searches; and that records are kept of each search and are reviewed by an outside auditor for compliance.  Levey said there had been one instance of abuse in which an analyst had conducted a search that did not meet the terrorist-related criteria. The analyst was subsequently denied access to the database, he said.  During the last five years, SWIFT officials have raised concerns about the scope of the program, particularly at the outset, when it was handing over virtually its entire database. The amount of data handed over each month has been winnowed down.  ""The safeguards were not all there in September 2001,"" Levey acknowledged. ""We started narrowing it from the beginning.""  New safeguards have been added, he said, noting that SWIFT officials are now allowed to be present when analysts search the data and to raise objections with top officials.   Officials from other government agencies have raised the issue of accessing the records for other investigative purposes, but Levey said such proposals have been rejected -- largely out of concern that doing so might erode support for the program.  Asked what would prevent the data from being used for other purposes in the future, Levey said doing so would likely trigger objections from SWIFT and the outside auditor.  A SWIFT representative said that Booz Allen Hamilton, an international consulting firm, is the auditor but provided no further details on how the oversight process works.  Although the searches focus on suspected terrorist activity overseas, U.S. officials acknowledged that they do delve into the financial activities of Americans, noting that privacy laws don't protect individuals believed to be acting as a ""foreign terrorist agent.""  Officials said the administration has briefed congressional intelligence committees on the SWIFT program. In contrast, information on the NSA wiretapping was shared only with key lawmakers. One senior congressional aide said the committees have ""a good handle on what the executive branch is doing to track terrorist financing"" and are generally supportive of those efforts.  But the operation seems to have been kept secret from key segments of the banking industry, including senior executives in the United States and overseas.  John McKessy, chairman of the SWIFT user group in the United States, said he was unaware of any such program. McKessy represents companies and institutions that are not members of the SWIFT cooperative but use its messaging system.  SWIFT noted that its published policies clearly indicate that it cooperates with law enforcement authorities and that the subpoenas were ""discussed carefully within the board,"" made up of members from 25 major banks. SWIFT said it has also kept informed an oversight committee drawn from the central banks of the major industrial countries.  *  The SWIFT program plugs a gap in global efforts to track terrorism financing.  In the United States, law enforcement authorities can access bank records if they get permission through the legal process. The FBI also has various legal ways to get almost instantaneous access to financial records. And U.S. banking laws require financial institutions to file Suspicious Activity Reports, but authorities believe Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups know how to evade the activities that trigger such red flags.  U.S. officials, however, long have complained that they cannot get access to financial records overseas and that some requests for cooperation from foreign governments and financial institutions took months, while others were rebuffed.   ""The sort of 18th century notions on this stuff drive me nuts,"" said one senior U.S. counterterrorism official. ""Somebody can move money with the click of a mouse, but it takes me six months to find it. If that is the world in which we live, you have to understand the costs involved with that.""  The Sept. 11 commission urged the government in its July 2004 report on the U.S. intelligence failures leading up to the terrorist attacks to put more emphasis on tracking the flow of funds, rather than seeking to disrupt them, to learn how terrorist networks are organized.  Lee Hamilton, a former congressman and co-chairman of the commission who said he has been briefed on the SWIFT program, said U.S. intelligence agencies have made significant progress in recent years, but are still falling short. ""I still cannot point to specific successes of our efforts here on terrorist financing,"" he said.",""

It has even set up its own financial database to track money flows through a ""tailored access operations"" division.  The National Security Agency (NSA) widely monitors international payments, banking and credit card transactions, according to documents seen by SPIEGEL.  The information from the American foreign intelligence agency, acquired by former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, show that the spying is conducted by a branch called ""Follow the Money"" (FTM). The collected information then flows into the NSA's own financial databank, called ""Tracfin,"" which in 2011 contained 180 million records. Some 84 percent of the data is from credit card transactions.  Further NSA documents from 2010 show that the NSA also targets the transactions of customers of large credit card companies like VISA for surveillance. NSA analysts at an internal conference that year described in detail how they had apparently successfully searched through the US company's complex transaction network for tapping possibilities.  Their aim was to gain access to transactions by VISA customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to one presentation. The goal was to ""collect, parse and ingest transactional data for priority credit card associations, focusing on priority geographic regions.""  In response to a SPIEGEL inquiry, however, VISA issued a statement in which it said, ""We are not aware of any unauthorized access to our network. Visa takes data security seriously and, in response to any attempted intrusion, we would pursue all available remedies to the fullest extent of the law. Further, its Visa's policy to only provide transaction information in response to a subpoena or other valid legal process.""  The NSA's Tracfin data bank also contained data from the Brussels-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a network used by thousands of banks to send transaction information securely. SWIFT was named as a ""target,"" according to the documents, which also show that the NSA spied on the organization on several levels, involving, among others, the agency's ""tailored access operations"" division. One of the ways the agency accessed the data included reading ""SWIFT printer traffic from numerous banks,"" the documents show.  But even intelligence agency employees are somewhat concerned about spying on the world finance system, according to one document from the UK's intelligence agency GCHQ concerning the legal perspectives on ""financial data"" and the agency's own cooperations with the NSA in this area. The collection, storage and sharing of politically sensitive data is a deep invasion of privacy, and involved ""bulk data"" full of ""rich personal information,"" much of which ""is not about our targets,"" the document says.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Herbalizer","3986","2013-11-23T08:54:50","Do YOU think TOR is still safe from GOVT spying?","Discussion/Security","Well, based on some of the Snowden documents, we know that the NSA and GCHQ are actively targeting Tor and have a number of tools at their disposal to attempt to de-anonymize Tor users:  [Clearnet warning] http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption [/Clearnet warning]  However, these are targeted attacks rather than passive data collection (as far as I can tell). This means that the feds would have to already suspect you based on other information or be otherwise specifically interested in you; however, based on what we've seen, it may not take much justification to consider someone an ""adversary"" or ""person of interest"" or (more likely) someone related to a person of interest.  Let's say you're a buyer of moderate personal amounts of whatever it is you're into. Let's say it's a worst-case scenario, and some 3-letter agency has discovered records of your illicit activities on Tor on ""accident,"" i.e. as part of an investigation of someone or something else tangentially related to you. Would it be worth it for said 3-letter agency to bust you? Extremely unlikely.  But what about other law enforcement entities that might be given access to this information for some reason or another? The exact extent of information-sharing by the NSA and other agencies is unknown, but it's suspected to be more widespread than publicly acknowledged. It's possible that these records could fall into the hands of, say, some local cops who are just petty and bored enough to want to bust you. But it would be extremely unlikely for them to reveal the source of their information, and simply linking SR activity to your IP address might not be enough to hold up in court. Instead, they would need to work backwards, and investigate you to come up with enough concrete and legitimately-acquired evidence to make a convincing case against you. Or, they could just arrest you for being black and happen to discover drugs in the process.  However, I still don't consider this a likely scenario for the average buyer or even vendor here. If you've done your due diligence and taken the steps necessary to protect your information, and the rest of your life is fairly clean, you probably don't have much to worry about. In other words, I don't think Tor is the weak link here; of course there are exceptions, but it's *nearly always* the stupid human errors that get a person busted, not targeted attacks on the encrypted communications of someone who has otherwise airtight anonymity.  Just my two cents. Someone feel free to correct me if I'm missing any new information on the subject.  EDIT: typo.",""

From what I can gather, not everyone has that option with local bitcoins - primarily because there is no guarantee that you can get coins from someone as it requires them to be selling in your area. Some in smaller cities or towns may not be as lucky and might have to drive 40, 50, 100 miles...who would do that to obtain $50 or $100 in bitcoin? You'd spend just about that in gas! Cost of security I guess, but even then there's no guarantee that anyone is selling btc for cash in your immediate area so it can be out of the question at times.  I've read your security thread a couple of times, great info & thanks for that - on that note, are there really any notable or public cases where individuals who were just buying drugs (any drug for that matter) for personal use have been busted? I see that there have been those who have had CD's and whatnot occur, but was usually due to poor practice (no PGP, shit vendor, etc) - for those using PGP and dealing with a non-compromised vendor, I don't seem to recall or can't find any articles or stories pointing to a bust - most of them refer to vendors and whatnot.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jolly Roger","28266","2014-02-22T11:59:25","Hmm...hiding bitcoin origins...","Discussion/Security"," Sure, you could do that. But think about it like this. If you keep creating a bunch of wallets that have almost no transactions except ones going to and from Silk Road, and they all originate or end up linking to YOU, it is not that hard to figure out that you are probably involved in Silk Road.   Just because you create 5 wallets in between YOU and SILK ROAD does not break any links between you and if every transaction between yourself and Silk Road originates from a coin exchange, it will not be difficult to figure out who is the sender of those funds.   Right now acquiring and selling coins anonymously is difficult, and one has to rely on third party services. It sucks, but it is the best we have right now. That is why most people recommend buying coins locally with cash to make sure the coins can never be traced to you. Worst case they might be able to trace them to the person who sold them to you, but if you paid cash and only spoke with them over email via Tor, then it would not even be worth their time to pursue you.   There are a few new projects being worked on, one called ZeroCoin which is supposed to completely obfuscate the coin origins and make tracing absolutely impossible, but Bitcoin developers are not willingly accepting it at this time.   Shared Send was probably the best option out there, but it recently got disabled for reasons can we can only speculate might be related to law enforcement pressuring them for anti-money laundering laws.   At this time, your best option is likely local bitcoins (with anonymous account and Tor email) paid with cash. Shared Coin over to Bitcoin Fog, and then Bitcoin Fog to Silk Road.   Hope this helps.","WHAT IF...silk road was compromised? WHAT IF...Bitcoin Fog was compromised?I think a lot of us have relied on services through BCF and the like to hide coin origin.

This may occur when members of the jury disagree with the law the defendant has been charged with breaking, or believe that the law should not be applied in that particular case. A jury can similarly convict a defendant on the ground of disagreement with an existing law, even if no law is broken (although in jurisdictions with double jeopardy rules, a conviction can be overturned on appeal, but an acquittal cannot).  A jury verdict contrary to the letter of the law pertains only to the particular case before it. If a pattern of acquittals develops, however, in response to repeated attempts to prosecute a statutory offence, this can have the de facto effect of invalidating the statute. A pattern of jury nullification may indicate public opposition to an unwanted legislative enactment.  In the past, it was feared that a single judge or panel of government officials may be unduly influenced to follow established legal practice, even when that practice had drifted from its origins. In most modern Western legal systems, however, juries are often instructed to serve only as ""finders of facts"", whose role it is to determine the veracity of the evidence presented, and the weight accorded to the evidence,[1] to apply that evidence to the law and reach a verdict, but not to decide what the law is. Similarly, juries are routinely cautioned by courts and some attorneys not to allow sympathy for a party or other affected persons to compromise the fair and dispassionate evaluation of evidence during the guilt phase of a trial. These instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification. Some commonly cited historical examples of jury nullification involve the refusal of American colonial juries to convict a defendant under English law.[2]  Juries have also refused to convict due to the perceived injustice of a law in general,[3] or the perceived injustice of the way the law is applied in particular cases.[4] There have also been cases where the juries have refused to convict due to their own prejudices such as the race of one of the parties in the case.[5]  And a couple good videos on youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxYUr6CNopQ 24k views  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqH_Y1TupoQ 1.8 million views.  It would be great if we had a law student or professor on here to talk a little more about it. AmA request?  ",""

Remember though that it is a tenuous balance of money, probability, and sheer ""luck"" if you can call it that. From my research into the subject of controlled delivery and ""getting caught"" [because we all went through that phase haha] I have come to a couple conclusions. You will almost never get any form of attention unless you are in the big leages. By big leagues I mean over $10,000 per transaction. If you aren't thinking in those kinds of numbers then you probably dont have much to worry about. We know this is where they start caring because it is when FinCEN gets involved in the ""white market"".     We also learned a bit about what it takes to ""trip the sensor"" when the first Silk Road fell. If you remember, there was a flurry of activity afterwards. Many big players were being taken down and you can bet that it was all linked to the money they were bringing in weighed against the probability of Uncle Sam being able to take a peice of the cake. There were a few very unlucky individuals who received controlled deliveries so that the Feds could force them to ""testify"" that they had indeed received illegal goods from the User that they were after. They still only wound up getting possession charges, and a few even fought them and won. This was all in the pursuit of the big players though and probably only 1/50 of 1% of users were even considered.     The deal now is pretty great for your average user though. If you follow the proper OpSec, then your chances of facing any sort of legal trouble is pretty much nil. As was said before, receiving a letter full of dope with your name on it isn't in itself illegal (If you are super paranoid, just write ""RETURN TO SENDER"" in big red letters on the package and let it sit for a day or two without opening. If LE is coming, then it will come in that timeframe.) For all you know some crazy ex-girlfriend is trying to get you pinched. The Road is enormous, and is still only a peice of the PUBLIC dark web marketplace. There are plenty of invite-only markets for the high rollers and even more enormous deals going down through PGP alone. Don't get to self-important about your little baggie of dope. If the feds can't make money off your stash, then they won't come for it 99.99999% of the time.     As for local, provincial, and state LE, they are too ass-fuck retarded to begin to construct a meaningful response to onion-encrypted-cryptocurrency-mediated drug sales, especially when there are still plenty of black people dealing crack on the corner. As a rule of thumb these assholes will always pick the low-hanging fruit, that is Joe Dumbass dealing meth out of his trailer keeping $5000 in cash under his mattress. It is just too easy to go after those guys. Simply make sure you aren't anywhere near the lowest hanging fruit. The simple fact that you are posting on this forum makes you a worthless prospect to most LE because 1. You can read and write 2. You are computer and PGP literate 3. You are likely white 4.

Yes, there are many people who had their packages seized, even small uninteresting users such as I am. They usually get a love letter and they should better consider their address to be burned. If someone comes asking, they answer ""I don't know who sent it"". More investigation is very unlikely in most cases, but again, depends on circumstances.  Having your name on an illegal package is not a crime. They cannot consider you to be ""offender"" without any charges, and charges are a lot more work than it looks like. If you have a suspicion, wait until you open a package for a few days because even if they come, you can say that you planned on returning it because it's not yours.  Cheers",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","flux101","44959","2014-09-09T00:27:40","Has anyone ever had a package seized by LE?","Discussion/Legal","Let's be honest, many users here are buying drugs and having them sent to their residence in their name, or someone who lives there. Yeah there are obviously other circumstances, but this is for a large percentage of users.  That said, like others have said, it is not illegal to have your name on a package containing illegal drugs. Accepting the package is what makes it all illegal.  I already know what is coming to my home at all times, and nothing requires a signature. That would be a dead giveaway. From what I understand the best option is to deny the delivery, knowledge of the delivery and cease contact with the 'fake' postman or police. They have no options at that point. If you are buying pounds of weed, they come in boxes and I've read that they have sensors within the boxes that once opened trigger a raid from LE.  This is why I do not deal with that kind of shit thru SR. I deal with stuff that can come in regular letters/envelopes, never had a problem - knock on wood.  Truthfully if I ever see someone standing at my door trying to have a package signed for, my first response is to not even answer the door but if it came to that point I'm sure they'd try again. That said, I'd probably answer the door, deny having any knowledge of what they're trying to 'deliver', tell them I'm busy with family problems and close the door. Should be the end of it.",""

If a vendor insists that you sign something as proof of identity -- WALK AWAY.  If you sign something incriminating, you lose all plausible deniability.  Let's look at the scenario from the buyer's perspective: Let's assume you want to order from Buds 'R Us. Buds 'R Us tells you that they want to verify that you are an old customer (as opposed to a cop) by verifying your identity. So, they want you to sign something with your PGP key to prove that you are who you say you are.  You badly want to order, so you go along with the request -- you sign an order to Buds 'R Us using your PGP key.

Are they keeping statistics as to what each customer purchaed, and when? Are they retaining names and addresses as well? Finally, valid PGP-signatures are non-repudiable -- once the signatures verify, the signed documents CANNOT be disavowed as forgeries. Ross Ulbricht/DPR is likely to learn this the hard way, at his trial. If the Feds found DPR's private PGP key on Ulbricht's laptop, then he cannot repudiate the messages with valid PGP signatures.

Not all products are shipped to all countries, some products have shipping restrictions. You can find these restrictions in the products' additional information. Be aware that it is the customers responsibility to order only those products that are legal in their country. Magic-mushrooms-shop.com is not aware of the legal status of our products are in other countries. For more information, we would like to direct you to the website of your government.  Discretely All our packages are shipped discretely. There is no indication on the outside of the parcel what the contents is.  The packages do not contain invoices, packaging lists or instructions. These are only available digitally. A copy can be requested at any time.  So the question is are grow kits illegal or just the actual shrooms? How discreetly do you think they ship their product because it's not like SR? and lastly on a fb page about truffles a dude ordered some a customs sent him a letter saying it's been seized.

You can research how they've done that using any search engine.  However, they can only do that if you order your kit and it comes with instructions.  Never trust any kit from any clearnet vendor which includes instructions!!!!!  That is a possible setup.    If you like, I will make a custom listing for you on the marketplace which will include everything you need to grow including detailed instructions, spore syringes of your choice of 5 different strains , 10 year old Hippo Poop, Crushed oyster shell, rye-millet-wheat mix, cocoa coir, vermiculite, and every thing else you'll need and I'll also be available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have regarding the process.    Whether you decide to buy from me or not, I will still be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding any part of the process should you run into problems.  It can be a bit overwhelming when first starting out and it's good to have someone familiar with the process that you can trust.  Clearnet forums are useless and they'll only confuse you.  Send me a pm here if interested.",""

Not all products are shipped to all countries, some products have shipping restrictions. You can find these restrictions in the products' additional information. Be aware that it is the customers responsibility to order only those products that are legal in their country. Magic-mushrooms-shop.com is not aware of the legal status of our products are in other countries. For more information, we would like to direct you to the website of your government.DiscretelyAll our packages are shipped discretely. There is no indication on the outside of the parcel what the contents is.  The packages do not contain invoices, packaging lists or instructions. These are only available digitally.

From a letter, dated 13 September 2001, from Herbert Schaepe, Secretary of the UN International Narcotics Control Board, to the Dutch Ministry of Health:[6]      As you are aware, mushrooms containing the above substances are collected and used for their hallucinogenic effects. As a matter of international law, no plants (natural material) containing psilocine and psilocybin are at present controlled under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. Consequently, preparations made of these plants are not under international control and, therefore, not subject of the articles of the 1971 Convention [emphasis added]. Criminal cases are decided with reference to domestic law, which may otherwise provide for controls over mushrooms containing psilocine and psilocybin. As the Board can only speak as to the contours of the international drug conventions, I am unable to provide an opinion on the litigation in question.  read more on wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_psilocybin_mushrooms   It of course depends which country you are in but in the UK it is certainly illegal to grow them. It is also illegal to buy/sell the spores except for microscopy use however there is no requirement for you to actually prove that you are using them for microscopy hence the spores are available on ebay. The substrate required is relatively easy to make too however that is also available on ebay.co.uk to buy pre-sterilised. If someone were to buy or sell both items together then it would be good evidence that they were to be used together and therefore show that it was not for microscopy use so they are not sold together but in simply the two component parts you need, substrate and spores.

ONLY decrypt offline/air-gapped. among MANY other things. you can search my posts if you like...but again. you should NEVER be forced to have the same nym on the market as on the forums. period. it nearly got my ass BUSTED!and this from a discussion yesterday on this thread on the Silk Road Forums v2: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=26911and in answer to this question:""scary shit! Mirage how did you know when it happened to you? I also read that air gaped thing basicly airgaped is remove all internet wire and wifi from device correct? how do keyloggers get on your device to start? sorry for all the questions,M"".....(quote)there are any number of way's. anything from a physical ""sneak n' peak"", direct trojan insertation/firewire DMA snoop, to (more likely) remote browser exploits, random ""firmware/OS updates"", ect. (like i recently received on my new Android? (hmmm...go figure?) since these ""updates"" do not actually exist in reality for my phone? according to both the Samsung website AND Samsung support staff!) hmm?.... but OSX Crisis (for example. which has the [goverment contracter's] ""Hacking Teams"", $250,000 a year code written all over it), was found a week later. but up until that point? there was NO known rootkit or trojan that existed on the planet with those capabilities for OSX. so i was like...uhhh?...wtf? and the closest one i found with those capabilities? (""OSX Crisis"") was found a week later. and it doesn't even require an Admin account to gain root privileges. just a user account. crazy! and therefore was able to gain low-level firmware (BIOS) as well as unlimited ""virtual"" persistance on my system! cuz your hardware/firmware? is really just software in disguise! microcode on your CPU, BIOS, ect. and anytime you download an OS/firmware update, ect? you are essentially just handing over control to root and granting 'whoever' full root access to your machine! which is why verifiying/checksums, ect are SO important to do! whether it be before installing Tails/TBB, or ""whatever""? as Peter Stuge says in the link below? ""Security starts many layers before the crypto!""...and this kit survived reboots, re-installs, 35x wipes, ect..on multiple machines, jumping drives, ect. it's a pretty crazy story. that i have yet to tell in full. but to answer your question, i only found it cuz i was stripping apart OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) in an attempt to make a more ""secure"" version of OSX to run off a flashdrive, removing all location tracking capabilities, ect, and all other software level vulnerabilaties. and in the process of stripping it down? i got down to the ""bare bones""....and the rest is history. and after obversing the rootkit's behavior (thru sloppy logging, Activity Monitor, ect. cuz even ""they"" aren't 'perfect'. technology is progressing far too fast. even for them. especially when dealing with slumdogz like 'Hacking Team'/RCS (Remote Control Systems)...and so after a week or 2? i decided to fight back....!and before you knew it? i was literally fighting an agent in 'real-time'. taking down every attempt i made to disable it. disabling all my passwords, apps, little snitch, ect. one at a time. then i'd reboot/re-install, change passwords, ect..but i couldn't keep up! then (for the SECOND time in my life) there was suddenly a ""guest"" account"" on my login screen...and mobile ""Jetpack"" wi-fi networks abound! then i'd break out Disk Warrior, ect, watch it get disabled...watch my DVD drive switch from Magittsu to Fajitsu or whatever in 'real-time'. viewing all logs during any new installation, noticed the differences, (every install was getting ""remotely"" installed)...and any new install had the ""Send Registration to Apple"" (omg?...uh? thingy/link?) 'greyed-out'...and then after a couple daze of that? they just sent me to Single User mode, ect. leaving me to fight on command line (which was NOT my speciallty at the time). and things were starting to get VERY scary! i fianlly decided to call my mom. and all of a sudden every attempt to do so was cut off! i broke out a burner and got thru and told her what was up! (and ""immediatelly"" got a call back from some 'restricted' number yelling ""how long have you had this phone? where did you get it! ect... lol!)...it was literally like THE best feeling in the world! cuz by that time i had flushed everything...and they were SOOOO pissed that little ol' mirage had gotton one (or two? or 10?) over on them, lol...  then. until all of a sudden. they wiped (almost) all my drives clean. and every flash drive attached to my hub. (which the kit had been jumping to and from automatically). as i noticed by revelaing hidden files using Onyx, ect...but to the VERY end! i WON! it was crazy/scary times. and a year before Snowden. and a week before OSX Crisis. and i ""really"" thought i was losing it....but as we know now....that ain't nothin! luckily i've been using macs since the mid-90's. and they sooner rather than later realized they had fucked with the ""wrong"" veganoid, lol....and just wiped (most) of my drives clean and gave up. but i gotz leftoverz. and so do trusted friends. and so does the ACLU. and we're workin on it! and as i mentioned, (all in this timeframe) Apple support staff straight up addmitted to me TWICE that they had backdoors for the NSA! so take it or leave it! i'm workin on gettin those phone calls! or just? run Tails ""Live"" on DVD-R when commiting felonies? regarless of the hardware you are using. although you really should be flashing your BIOS to Coreboot and physically soldering/'write-protecting' it if you truly wanna stay safe from such Alphabet Snoopkits! ""Hardening hardware and choosing a #goodBIOS [30c3] ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VvR-vsdMlQi truly feel it was only intended to be be spyware. used to collect evidence, ect, and not intended to be found. and good rootkits aren't intended to be found. that's why they are ""snoopkits""...spyware...perhaps just run bare bones linux? or Tails, ect. (litterally) on a Raspberry Pi Model A? and do some research...or ur truly fukt! cuz Tor alone will NOT protect you. or GPG (if you're not decrypting ""offline""/'air-gapped'. and i 'know' how i was de-anonymized. as i have made VERY clear both here and elsewhere. by using the same Vendor nym on the marketplace as on the forums! let alone across marketplaces! targettted Tor-traffic analysis is a VERY real thing! and i ""really"" wish Vendors at least would listen up! cuz i ""truly"" care yo! just ""Be prepared!"" Boy Scouts Motto! (especially if you're a vendor! i won't be again anytime soon. i'm on their radar. instead i have just become their worst nightmare instead! haha! and will be doing everything i can to protect those of you that do! peacemirage"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Obiwan Shinobi","10338","2013-12-21T06:32:53","How the FBI is actually capable of attacking TOR","Discussion/Security","There's a recent whitepaper floating around about how to trick a hidden service into connecting to your evil Tor guard nodes. It requires 12 or so nodes at $60 a month each, not a big investment to pinpoint a hidden service with relative accuracy. Of course if you own your guard nodes, nothing will happen to you because you won't choose the federal nodes. I would also imagine this site is using a sort of Tor isolated proxy so is immune to this attack as well.   The GCHQ/NSA method (and probably FBI now) involves them running their own very large tor relay network in hopes you connect to it, and they route you through their private internal network to spy on what you're doing and do meta analysis but you can also defeat this by running your own relays, or connecting to known safe ones. They are primarily interested in exit nodes so they can spy on terr0ristz forum postings and whatever, not really internal relays besides just pushing you towards their evil exit that strips SSL, or MITM attacks your software updates so you get evil federal software.   You can edit Torrc file to only connect to Torservers.net exit relays and the NSA even wrote in their little ""Tor stinks"" slides that they are unwilling to compromise existing inner or exit relays for fear of being discovered.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","m0rph","32712","2014-03-19T03:35:12","anonymous verifiable ensured set size surveys","Discussion/Security","I have read multiple studies that survey groups on sensitive topics, one example may be drug use, although this is not so taboo these days. Usually these studies are carried out at universities in sociology or psychology classes, or similar anyway. Since they are often asking people to admit to things that may be highly taboo or illegal, they need to convince the people filling out the surveys that they are anonymous. Usually the motivation for taking the survey is that the student will receive class credit. I have read of some of the systems they utilize to do this, and am not satisfied with any of them. One popular technique is issuing identical copies of a survey to students in closed envelopes. The students then go home and fill out the forms. Then they put them in another unmarked envelope and seal it. Then they take this envelope to a third party location where they submit it, in return for a token that they can show to their professor in return for class credit. There are numerous issues with this system. Primarily, it is security by policy. Usually nothing stops the person who the closed envelope is submitted to from opening it and looking at the results, although they may not know the person handing it in they will recognize their face. A potentially even bigger concern is the fact that the paper will have the students fingerprints uniquely on it. Say the survey is trying to determine the prevalence of male rapists, and a student who takes it is later suspected of rape. What is stopping the police from issuing a court order for all of the surveys and fingerprinting them, and using this as evidence that their suspect has raped a person? Now I am not in favor of protecting rapists from the law, but I am in favor of getting accurate results on surveys, and the only way you get accurate results is if the people answering the questions know with a high degree of certainty that they are anonymous. Therefore, I propose a system for anonymous surveying which meets all of the goals of those who issue them, while actually providing strong security by design to those who take them.  First we must go over the goals:  1. The people taking the surveys must be highly anonymous. This includes protection from traffic analysis, malware, etc. It also means the underlying system they are using to take the survey must be anonymous.  2. The people taking the surveys need to prove that they took the surveys. This is to ensure that they can get class credit for having done so.  3. The people taking the survey need to be from a set size that is predetermined (ie: students in a certain class), and it needs to be certain that each person only took the survey one time (to protect the academic integrity of the survey)  Now I shall propose the system:  It shall consist of a computerized system, those surveyed are to fill out the surveys from the privacy of their own homes on their computers, or from any computer which they feel comfortable with. The survey results are to be sent to a hidden service on the Tor network, with students connecting to it over Tor, this is to protect somewhat (though not perfectly) from traffic analysis. There is an issue with the fact that the people issuing the survey will know the location of the hidden service and the names of the students taking the survey, this could open it up to end to end timing attacks, but it is a level of protection that is still substantial. Alternatively, a third party company could run such server and make it available to multiple professors who desire to issue anonymous surveys, with the location of the server itself being a company secret. In any case, this offers a degree of protection from traffic analysis.  The students taking the surveys should not need to learn how to configure anything. Rather, a live USB system that is specific to the surveying system should be created. This serves two goals, first of all it makes it so they can immediately take surveys without having to be technically competent, and second of all it protects from malware that they likely already have on their Windows installations spying on them.   When the survey is first announced in the class, the professor can hand out a set of shared secrets in closed envelopes. It doesn't matter which shared secret which student gets, all that matters is each one is large and unique. The shared secret is used to meet goal 3, only students in the class obtain shared secrets, it is also used to ensure each student only takes the survey one time as will soon be explained. The professor then writes down the .onion address of the hidden service on a whiteboard, as well as a unique survey ID. Now when at home the students can load the live USB and they will be presented not with a normal desktop but rather with a specific GUI (full screen, impossible to minimize) dedicated entirely to the taking of surveys. The first step is registration:  To register for the survey the student enters the .onion address and the survey ID and their shared secret into the application. Now the logic of the system comes into play:  A. The survey processing server logs the shared secret and marks it as having registered to take the survey. B. A blind signature scheme is used to sign a random token. This blind signature token is stored on the USB.   Registration must be a few days prior to taking the survey, so that all students can register to take the survey. A few days later  A. The students sign back into the survey taking system, although this time they use only the survey ID and .onion address, not the shared secret B. They fill out the survey and submit it along with the blind signed token C. A new random token is blind signed.   The second blind signed token is used so that they can prove they took the survey to get class credit. The first token is used to be able to submit the survey. The shared secret is used to ensure only the set size takes the survey and that only one survey is taken per participant.   Because of the shared secret, registration can be limited to the set size of the class. Because of the blind signature scheme being utilized the first time, there is unlinkability between the student and the survey they fill out. Because of Tor there is protection from traffic analysis. Because a live USB is used there is protection from malware. The second blind signature allows the student to prove they took the survey without revealing which answers they submitted. Because of the delay between registration and taking of the survey, all of the survey takers will mix together. Internally to the system itself, anyone who took the survey should be indistinguishable from anyone else who did, with only traffic analysis and malware to worry about (but both are significantly protected from).   One problem is that the blind signed token is stored on the USB. Wiping a USB is dubious at best, although we can attempt to wipe the first token after the survey is finished. Another option would be to generate a long random key during the first run and to instruct the student to write it down to a piece of paper. The first blind signed token can be stored encrypted with that key. After taking the survey the student can be instructed to destroy that piece of paper immediately thereafter. ",""

Sources should be high quality and ideally primary sources. Since there is a diverse set of possible topic areas, if you want to get a sense of what is appropriate intelligence then search the forum using the [intel] tag. --  Source: Title: Global Drug Enforcement - Practical Investigative Techniques Author: Lee, Gregory D Publisher : CRC Press ISBN10 | ASIN : 0203488989 ISBN13 : 9780203613078  --  Sources of Information Sources of information include both people and institutions. Drug agents need a steady flow of information in order to be effective in their jobs. Information is the lifeblood of any investigation, and drug cases rely more on information than any other form of criminal investigation.  Everyone a drug agent comes into contact with is a potential source of information. Those people and institutions most frequently encountered include:  â¢ Airline ticket agents  â¢ Travel agents  â¢ Baggage handlers  â¢ Car rental employees  â¢ Hotel clerks  â¢ Utility companies  â¢ Telephone service providers  â¢ Real estate agents  â¢ Internet service providers  â¢ Bank employees  â¢ Taxi drivers  â¢ County Assessorâs Office  â¢ Credit bureaus  â¢ Private express shipping companies  â¢ Yacht club employees  â¢ Boat sales personnel  â¢ Flight service station employees  â¢ Private airplane sales personnel  These potential sources of information can provide drug agents with documentation of the suspectâs travel, banking, and telephone habits. This information frequently produces leads to other members of the conspiracy, and may help locate hidden assets and drug proceeds.  Most people employed in these occupations provide information to drug agents either because they are compelled to by court order, or they have altruistic motives. Offering to pay these sources of information may result in some being offended, while others are eager to earn extra money while helping law enforcement.  Airline Ticket Agents Many basic drug investigations have the potential of being expanded into a complex smuggling case. Smuggling cases have the goal of identifying not only the smugglers involved with introducing the drug into the United States, but also with identifying those who move the drugs from one part of the country to the other.  Drugs are commonly moved from one place to another via commercial airline. Both passengers and employees of airlines in all categories have been arrested for actually smuggling controlled substances, or for facilitating the transfer of these illegal drugs. Airline ticket agents, as well as other categories of employees, can help tremendously in cases of this type. Airline ticket agents, when trained by drug agents on the profile of a commercial air smuggler, can provide specific information about passengers, how their tickets were paid, as well as when and where they were purchased. Sometimes a simple computer check accessing this type of information can provide drug agents assigned to airport interdiction operations with information that frequently leads to arrests and seizures. See Chapter 15 for specific information.  Travel Agents Unlike airline ticket agents who usually only have access to specific information pertaining to their own airline, travel agents can access information from not only airline computers, but those maintained by rail, bus, and cruise ships, plus hotels throughout the world.  These agents can provide drug law enforcement officers with vital information in the tracking of individuals involved in drug trafficking. Leads generated from travel agencies can provide drug agents with the opportunity to glean telephone toll information from calls made at hotels stayed at by the trafficker, as well as the method of payment for the room. The credit card information from payment of the hotel stay can lead to the development of other information in connection with the credit card application.  Car Rental Employees Employees of car rental agencies can provide drug agents with information pertaining to when and where a suspect rented a vehicle, how he paid for it, and the expected date of return of the car. They can also provide agents with information pertaining to prior history of car rentals by a particular suspect. With a court order, rental companies will allow drug agents access to the vehicle the suspect will be renting in order to install tracking or other devices inside.  Hotel Registration Clerks These valuable sources of information can provide drug agents with not only the occupant of a certain room, but can search reservation computers for recent and future stays. Nationwide hotel chains and especially international hotel chains can provide information about the airline and flight on which the suspect will be arriving, and its origin. Also, the hotel can provide the international telephone numbers that were called from the room, and what hotel services, including Internet and other business center services, that may have been provided. Having this type of information may lead to the development of valuable leads in identifying sources of supply and co-conspirators.  Utility Companies Drug agents can quickly ascertain the names of persons paying for water, electric, and gas service at a particular address by contacting the appropriate utility company. Based on the huge volume of requests that are generated from law enforcement agencies in major metropolitan areas, these companies sometimes devote employees specifically for this purpose and sometimes require a subpoena before releasing this information.  Surveillance agents should contact more than one of the utility companies providing service to a specific address in order to compare names of subscribers. Some utilities, such as electric companies, may have initiated service in a manâs name, and the water and gas may be subscribed either in the name of the manâs wife or in an entirely different name. The names and the credit applications submitted to the utility companies to initiate service can lead to the identity of other members of the drug conspiracy. Furthermore, by furnishing a suspectâs name to a utility or local telephone company, the drug agents can determine if the suspect is a customer, and at what address services are being provided.  Drug agents in major metropolitan areas may find many different municipal and regional electric power companies within their jurisdiction. Often, agents will have to contact each company directly to ascertain the information they seek.  Telephone Service Providers One of the most important tools in a drug agentâs box is access to information pertaining to telephone calls made by suspects. Suspects rely on residential, business, pager, and cellular telephone service to communicate with other members of their criminal conspiracy and take steps to disguise their use of the telephone when possible.  Many suspects activate one or more cellular telephones only to discontinue the service or discard the actual telephone within a few days or weeks fearing law enforcement has obtained their number and may be listening in on their conversations. The reality of the situation is that there are many more telephones being used to facilitate drug transactions then there are drug agents to monitor them. Despite this, most drug traffickers do not take the chance, and will frequently cancel service, change subscriber names, or abandon cellular telephones altogether.  Under subpoena, telephone companies are required to provide drug law enforcement with the subscriber information and any particular detailed information called for in the subpoena. Typically, drug agents will ask for a record of all toll, or long-distance telephone calls made from a particular number for the past 6 months. After receiving this information, drug agents and intelligence analysts can see the relationship between the suspect and others that he calls. An analysis of telephone calls made by a particular subject can frequently identify members of the same conspiracy, and locate hiding places, stash houses, and the like. Telephone companies can also provide subscriber information on an emergency basis to law enforcement. For specific information pertaining to telephone analysis, see Chapter 17.  Real Estate Agents Real estate agents can perform a variety of services for drug agents during the course of an investigation. They have the ability to conduct property was financed, and with what lender. They can identify the real estate office responsible for the sale, as well as the escrow company that completed the transaction.  This type of information may be helpful in determining the assets of a particular drug trafficker when attempting to seize his property as drug proceeds. They may also be able to identify the architect who built the home or building, which may be of help if serving a high-risk search warrant. Architectural drawings may reveal unique or hidden compartments within the home.  Internet Service Providers Drug agents are encountering an increasing number of traffickers that rely on their own web sites, email, and the Internet to sell drugs, chemicals, and laboratory supplies. Internet service providers can provide law enforcement with the names and billing addresses of all subscribers to their services. They can also provide technical assistance in helping to track email, as well as email addresses used by subscribers.  Banking Institutions Banks are compelled to provide information to a drug agent who is armed with a grand jury subpoena. Requests can range from verifying whether a trafficker maintains an account at the bank, to the balance he maintains, and copies of applications for loans he may have made. They can also provide names of safety deposit box holders, as well as when they last had access to the boxes.  Security at banks require constant videotaping of customer transactions, and still photos can be obtained from the tapes. Making a deposit or withdrawal of drug proceeds may be an overt act in proving a conspiracy case, and these tapes may provide invaluable evidence.  Taxi Drivers Long a source of information for police officers, taxi drivers can provide suspect descriptions, where they were picked up and taken to, and possibly call back telephone numbers maintained by their dispatchers. Taxi drivers are a natural part of the landscape in any neighborhood they frequent. Drug agents may solicit trusted sources to drive by certain locations during different times of the day to look for a particular vehicle. A taxi company or independent driver may also allow drug agents the use of their vehicle for particular surveillance assignments.  County Assessorâs Office This governmental office can provide drug agents with the names of the owners of properties within the county, and advise when and if a certain property is in the process of changing ownership.  Credit Bureaus There are several large credit bureau organizations operating within the United States. Each maintains an extensive record of anyone who has ever established credit, as well as the payment history of an individual. The security management of credit organizations have assisted drug agents in the past in creating a credit history under an undercover name that will be used by an agent. Creating such a history, which will show employment, using totally fictitious information helps tremendously in gaining the confidence of traffickers while working undercover.  Express Shipping Companies Many drug traffickers have used express shipping companies such as Federal Express and United Parcel Service to transport drugs to customers. These companies, as well as others, have proven to be extremely cooperative in drug investigations. In addition to providing tracking information on packages, they may assist by lending uniforms, vehicles, and other items for use during special surveillance operations and controlled deliveries.  Yacht Club Employees Employees of yacht clubs may have inside information pertaining to the travels of particular boats and yachts, and who was aboard the vessels at the time they arrived at the club. They can also serve as lookouts for specific vessels drug law enforcement may be interested in.  Many employees hear rumors or are themselves asked to participate in certain aspects of maritime drug smuggling. They can provide leads into how services were paid for, who accompanied the trafficker during his visit at the club, how long his vessel was docked, etc. They can alert drug agents to furtive activity and suspicious persons that may be visiting with members of the yacht club or are waiting for them to arrive from a sailing voyage.  Boat and Yacht Sales Personnel These professional sales people will be able to provide information to drug law enforcement agents about the sales of popular vessels used in the smuggling of drugs. With a court order, they can provide law enforcement with access to vessels for the placement of tracking devices. They will also have access to financing information, bank loans, insurance carriers, and other companies and individuals involved in maritime businesses. Many drug smuggling cases are initiated based on information provided by yacht salesmen and women.  Flight Service Station Employees These employees work in offices at airports that provide private and commercial pilots with a place to rest, file flight plans, buy fuel, food, maps, rent aircraft, and other necessities for air travel. Like yacht clubs, but to a smaller degree, these employees can ascertain when a certain plane arrived or took off, who was flying the plane, and its destination. These employees can also look out for particular airplanes drug law enforcement knows are involved in air smuggling.  Private Airplane Sales Personnel Much like their yacht sales counterpart, private airplane sales personnel can provide listings of all sales of aircraft or who was interested in purchasing planes or modifying existing ones that may accommodate smugglers. These people could prove to be a wealth of information pertaining to air smuggles occurring in any particular area of the country.  Conclusion This list of sources of information is not all-inclusive, and not all the sources will be able to provide criminal information on a continuing basis. Drug agents should, however, make contacts at these establishments to cultivate informants who can provide specific, timely information about the activities of drug traffickers.  Summary Drug agents, like any criminal investigator, need to cultivate and develop sources of information from a variety of places. This can be accomplished by seeking out people in certain professions that may be privy to the goings-on of drug traffickers and smugglers.  Many of these sources can provide a wealth of information about particular sales transactions, what was purchased, how it was paid for, and the like. This information may prove vital in identifying co-conspirators and lead to the location of drugs and drug proceeds.  ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","199","2013-10-10T06:58:12","[Intel] Souces of Intelligence for DEA Agents","Discussion/Security","Resourceful Expert surveillance agents have been known to use their surroundings as natural camouflage. Using a fold up windshield sunscreen with slits cut in it to see out of while observing a suspect in a parking lot is just one example of resourcefulness exhibited by surveillance agents. Putting the hood up on a vehicle to make it appear to be disabled while positioned at a particularly good vantage point is another example of resourcefulness.  Observant Surveillance agents must be good observers. Experienced drug agents and police officers can see things that citizens without police experience cannot. Some police officers seem to have a sixth sense that aids them in anticipating what might happen next after observing the body language and demeanor of a suspect they are following. Drug agents can also often tell when a drug deal is about to take place, or when one has just occurred. Since many drug dealers assume they are constantly under surveillance, drug agents must be especially observant to see with whom they come in contact and what packages are exchanged.  Patience and Stamina Any surveillance potentially could conclude much later than the drug agents originally intended. The time spent on a surveillance depends on how successful the agents are in following the suspect, and exactly what the suspect is doing while being followed.  No two surveillance operations are alike, and because of their unpredictability, drug agents should be prepared for lengthy assignments that will require stamina. When a team of agents follow a suspect into a restaurant, most of that team will be outside in their vehicles waiting for the suspect to exit and will not have the ability to refresh themselves with food or drink. When it appears the suspect will be at a particular place for a predictable length of time, e.g., after he has ordered a meal, surveillance agents should take advantage of this time to make food runs.  Categories of Surveillance There are five categories of surveillance: intelligence gathering, prebuy and postbuy surveillance, reconnaissance, and physical survey. Each has an important role in leading to a successful drug operation and in keeping undercover agents safe.  Intelligence Gathering The whole purpose of surveillance is to gather intelligence about the suspect. The goal is for the drug agents to learn whom the suspect meets, where he lives, whom he visits, and where he socializes, etc. Conducting surveillance may discover previously unknown details concerning drug crimes, locate fugitives, or enhance the credibility of any informant involved.  Prebuy Surveillance Before any undercover agent or informant is sent to a location to purchase drugs during the course of the investigation, surveillance agents must be on hand ahead of time. The conducting of prebuy surveillance may aid in the identification of co-conspirators and may reveal the presence of counter-surveillance. For the protection of the undercover agent or informant, surveillance agents must be on hand before, during, and after the purchase of drugs in order to insure their safety.  Prebuy surveillance agents may be able to see accomplices that are armed, or identify who may be in possession of the drugs the traffickers intend to sell. Not conducting prebuy surveillance is abandoning an effective investigative tool and may result in safety problems for undercover personnel.  Postbuy Surveillance Even after the drugs have been purchased by the undercover agent or informant, and he or she has left the location, surveillance agents should remain on scene for a short while in order to see if the suspects return for any reason, and if so, who they meet with.  Simultaneously, other agents must keep surveillance on the undercover agent, who should not drive directly back to his or her office, to determine if suspects may be following. If suspects are following, their intention may be to rob the agent of the drugs, or possibly kidnap him or her to later extort more money from his âpartners.â Any notion that the undercover agents are being followed should immediately be communicated to the agents so they can initiate counter-surveillance driving techniques to avoid being seen returning to their office.  Reconnaissance Surveillance agents can recon the scheduled meeting spot with an undercover agent, and determine if there are suitable places to conduct stationary surveillance undetected. The case agent or surveillance team leader can assign surveillance agents to these locations in order to get a full field view of the activities that will take place there. Other surveillance agents familiar with the suspects, their cars, and where they live and work should show other agents who will be participating in the surveillance or stakeout.   Physical Survey Surveillance agents conduct preplanning activities to familiarize themselves with the topography of the area, and basic information regarding the neighborhood and its residents. Local police officers in the city where the surveillance is going to be conducted are an excellent source of information to determine what type of neighborhood the suspect lives in, and what the likelihood of encountering counter-surveillance by sympathetic neighbors is. They can also advise where the best local hospitals are in the event that they are needed. Physical surveys also determine typical traffic conditions in certain areas that may affect the ability of surveillance agents to maneuver while at the same time allowing agents to familiarize themselves with local streets and alleys.  Other Considerations Every surveillance agent should carry an adequate amount of cash to handle any emergency that may arise during a planned or unscheduled surveillance. Agents do not have time to go to an automatic teller machine or stop inside a bank to write a check while the surveillance is being conducted. Agents will need funds to quickly pay for meals if they are assigned to follow the suspect inside a restaurant, or to possibly purchase something if they go into a store. Using a credit card may take too long to allow the surveillance agent to rejoin his or her surveillance team members in a timely fashion.  Agents should always have in their vehicles a packed bag containing personal hygiene items and a change of clothing in case an overnight stay is necessary. The bag also doubles as a prop if they have to follow a suspect into an airport, train station, or hotel.  Surveillance team members also need to have all their communication equipment with them including:  â¢ Cellular telephones programmed with the telephone numbers of other agents and their supervisor in the event assistance is needed  â¢ Cellular telephone car battery cord  â¢ Charged portable radios with extra batteries  â¢ Pager  â¢ Binoculars or monocular  â¢ Bottled water â¢ Fruit or snacks  â¢ Flashlight  â¢ Map of the area  â¢ Pen and notepad or small tape recorder or digital recording machine to dictate time, date, places, and events observed  â¢ Several different styles of hats  â¢ Sunglasses  â¢ Jacket or coat appropriate for the weather  â¢ Umbrella  â¢ Shoulder bag for equipment storage or use as a prop  Agents should remember that it does not take the entire team to see when a suspect comes out of a building or returns to his car. One agent is usually sufficient to see the suspect exit a building, assuming he or she has an unobstructed view. During this time, other agents should be set up to follow the suspect away in any direction he may travel.  Rules of Surveillance There can be only one team leader during a surveillance operation. Each surveillance agent must have a specific assignment given by the team leader. When following a suspect in his vehicle into a store parking lot that is part of a strip mall, the surveillance team leader must immediately insure that members of the team are covering each driveway in anticipation of the suspect exiting there. The team leader can assign an agent to go into the business the suspect is visiting to determine who he is making contact with.  Furthermore, agents need to be positioned on the street in all possible directions of travel the suspect may go. Once the suspect returns to his car and is committed to driving away in one particular direction, the other agents will quickly catch up to continue the surveillance.  Surveillance agents should work out a form of communicating with each other while on foot and in sight of each other. Cellular telephones work well for this purpose, as do alphanumeric pagers that receive lines of text. Agents can call their office from the scene of foot surveillance and have someone transmit a page to these types of pagers telling other agents precisely where the suspect is. Using this system is preferred to using hard-to-conceal radios with limited range. Supervisors and surveillance team leaders need to make arrangements for a shift relief in the event the surveillance should need to go on for longer than expected.  Fundamentals of Surveillance â¢ Agents should avoid eye-to-eye contact with the suspect. Most suspects will immediately be convinced they are being followed if someone makes eye contact with them. Surveillance agents should not fear being discovered by the suspect, even if eye contact is made, since the suspect can never be positive drug agents are watching them.  â¢ Agents should have a rehearsed reason for being where they are. In the event the suspect should confront a surveillance agent and ask him why he or she is following him, they can deny such activity and tell them the reason for their presence. The agent should not leave the area immediately in an attempt to act natural, but they should no longer participate in the surveillance that day.  â¢ Surveillance agents can avoid attention and detection by acting as naturally as they can for their surroundings. If the suspect is followed into a restaurant and he is going to order a meal, the agent should also order something to justify his stay in the restaurant for as long as the suspect does.  â¢ Agents should not rely on information provided by persons who provide a service to the suspect. Asking the suspectâs barber, doorman, bartender, gardener, waiter, or housekeeper a question about the suspect usually will prompt them to immediately report their contact with the police, usually in hopes of a reward.  â¢ Surveillance agents need to be prepared to telephone the suspect at his home or business using a false pretense. Telephoning the suspectâs home or business asking for him is one way of verifying he is there. Suspects may answer these calls themselves and may be reluctant to say where they are. A convincing story may cause the suspect to relax his guard.  â¢ Checking the suspectâs mailbox to see who he is getting mail from, and what businesses he has a relationship with, may generate investigative leads. Checking his garbage, or taking it once it is placed on the sidewalk area of his residence for collection can be a treasure trove of information. Often cutting agents, small baggies, drug paraphernalia with drug residue, empty boxes of baking soda for the production of crack cocaine, duct tape to reseal kilogram packages of cocaine, etc. can be found in a suspectâs garbage.  â¢ When following the suspect in a vehicle, surveillance agents should not be afraid of being too close, especially in areas of heavy traffic. Large urban areas produce heavy traffic that calls for vehicles being close to one another at most times of the day and night.  â¢ Agents should not be ashamed of losing the suspect. Often a single red traffic light will prevent the agent from following the suspect through an intersection. Agents who violate traffic laws with impunity while the suspect watches are telegraphing their presence, thereby jeopardizing the surveillance. Losing a suspect during a surveillance sometimes cannot be helped, regardless of the amount of preplanning that was done. If the agents are convinced the suspect is aware of their presence, they should not immediately return to their office, but rather drive in different directions to avoid being followed themselves by any mobile counter-surveillance accomplices.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","199","2013-10-10T06:57:32","[Intel] Souces of Intelligence for DEA Agents","Discussion/Security","Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance Throughout the career of any drug agent, he or she will spend a substantial amount of time conducting surveillance. This is due to the fact that drug crimes are investigated as they happen as opposed to after-the-fact crimes such as burglary or robbery where the suspects are normally not known. Traditional police investigations do involve surveillance activities, however not nearly as often as drug cases because of the nature of the crime. Drug agents working as a surveillance team will develop into a highly effective force to gather intelligence information about suspects and identify co-conspirators in the drug trafficking organization.  Definition and Purpose of Surveillance Surveillance is the secretive and continuous or periodic watching of persons, vehicles, places, and objects to obtain information concerning the activities and identities of the individuals.  Surveillance is often the only investigative technique drug agents can use to identify stash pads where drugs are stored, couriers, and sources of supply. It also frequently identifies buyers and distributors as well as codefendants and co-conspirators.  There is no substitute for traditional, hands on surveillance. Following the primary suspect to learn his activities on any given day may lead drug agents to where he lives, who he associates with, what vehicles he had access to, where he socializes, and where he works. This information may be invaluable later when trying to locate him in order to make his arrest or to prevent him from committing another crime.  Frequently CIs (confidential informants) will tell their drug agent handlers that they have met a drug dealer willing to sell a particular drug to them with one caveat; he does not know the identity of the dealer. The drug agents should direct the informant to arrange a meeting in a public place with the man in order to allow the agents to place surveillance on him. From there, the agents potentially can identify what vehicle he is driving, where he lives, what his full description is, and possibly where he stores his drugs.  Types of Surveillance There are three basic types of surveillance used in modern drug enforcement: mobile, stationary, and electronic.  Mobile Conducted either on foot or using a vehicle, drug agents have an opportunity to follow the suspect to determine who he meets, where he goes, and what he does.  Stationary Stationary surveillance is conducted from a fixed point; often from within a building or parked vehicle.  Electronic Twenty-first century drug investigations often involve the use of technical listening equipment and cameras to keep suspects under constant surveillance or to alert them when they have arrived at a particular location. Law enforcement technicians are creative in ways of concealing cameras that are used by agents to maintain surveillance on suspects. A common piece of equipment used is a hollow transformer container, which can be found on telephone and power poles, that has a video camera inside that transmits microwave signals to a receiver at the drug agentsâ office. There the signal is recorded on videotape where it can be reviewed for activity overnight or at other times. The pole-cam, as it is called, is usually installed by drug agents posing as employees of the telephone or electric company servicing the area, and is nearly impossible to detect by the suspects. They have been used successfully for many years.  Other forms of electronic surveillance equipment may include hidden cameras in furnishings commonly found in any hotel room in the United States, including thermostats, alarm clocks, table lamps, and televisions. Cameras have also been installed in the brake lights of unoccupied automo-biles for recording suspects and the coming and goings of other vehicles that drive up to a particular address. Use of such devices should be discussed with local prosecutors to insure they do not violate any particular state statue forbidding the use of such devices, even by law enforcement.  Objectives of Surveillance There are many good reasons to conduct surveillances of suspected drug traffickers. As previously stated, drug trafficking involves many persons working in concert to achieve their goal. The drug agentâs objective is to identify as many persons as possible who are involved in the conspiracy and surveillance will go a long way in achieving this goal.  Identify the Main Target of the Investigation Conducting surveillance often leads to the full identify of the suspects involved in the drug trafficking organization. Sometimes, simply observing the license plate of the vehicle he drives and later determining the registered owner through records maintained by the state department of motor vehicles can lead to the true identity of the suspect. However, sometimes it becomes more challenging, particularly if the suspect has made efforts to thwart drug law enforcement. More on this will be discussed in the counter-surveillance portion of this chapter.  Even if the vehicle the suspect is driving is not his own, the leads developed from obtaining the registered owner information may later determine that the owner of the vehicle is also involved in the drug crime. If the registered owner is not involved directly, he or she can later be interviewed, which may lead to other persons who are involved.  If, for example, the unidentified suspect, when first observed, is driving a rental vehicle, his name, a driverâs license number and address can be ascertained from the car rental company. The company can also tell agents when the vehicle is due back, and possibly if the suspect arrived from out of town on a particular flight. The point is that surveillance creates investigative leads for drug agents that would not normally be available by any other means.  Identify Other Members of the Drug Organization Conducting surveillance of the suspect will often lead to the identification of other members of the criminal conspiracy. Many drug dealers work at his or her trade on a full-time basis, and the likelihood is good that every person they contact could be involved as well. All persons the main target of the investigation meets with should be fully identified. Drug agents can make record checks of these individuals to determine if they have a criminal back-ground. If they do, especially if they have a history of drug trafficking, this means the surveillance agents should continue their surveillance on these persons. Once surveillance agents begin to see that the suspects are only associating with each other, and no one new, it is probable that all members of their organization have been identified.  Locate Stash Locations Drug agents strive to seize large amounts of drugs during the course of their investigations. In many urban, suburban, and rural areas, huge quantities of drugs may be stored in innocent looking dwellings or commercial storage facilities. Suspects will travel to these locations to check on co-conspirators who are providing security for the drugs, determine the amount of the supply on hand, or remove a quantity for sale later. They will also be on the alert for anything out of the ordinary to alert them that drug agents are investigating their activities.  During the undercover phase of an investigation, the undercover agent or informant may order a quantity of drugs they believe the suspect cannot produce at the moment, forcing him to travel to where the drugs are stored. Sometimes to increase the likelihood of forcing the suspect to travel to get the drugs, the undercover agent will not order a specific amount of drugs until he or she meets personally with the suspect. Another technique is to pay for the drugs the suspect delivers, and then immediately order a similar quantity forcing him to return to the original location or go somewhere else to retrieve the drugs. Doing this gives the surveillance agents another opportunity to locate the stash pad if they happen to lose the suspect during their first attempt (Figure 6.1).  Obtain Probable Cause for a Search Warrant Surveillance agents may be able to articulate in an affidavit certain facts they observed that may lead a judge to issue a search warrant. For example, during a drug investigation surveillance agents observe the suspect meeting with an undercover agent at a restaurant to discuss a drug transaction. At the conclusion of the meeting, the surveillance agents follow the suspect to a house where he is observed entering the dwelling empty-handed. A few minutes later, surveillance agents observe the suspect leave the house carrying a shopping bag, which he places in the trunk of his vehicle. Surveillance agents then follow the suspect back to the original meeting location, where he delivers the bag that contained drugs to the undercover agent.  Thanks to the surveillance agents, they now know where the suspect probably stores his drugs. Without their observations, they would have no chance of obtaining a search warrant for the house to look for more drugs. If a search warrant is issued and agents find more drugs along with other suspects in the house, these additional people may be arrested as co-conspirators, or they may wish to cooperate with drug agents in providing information about the original suspect. In either event, surveillance agents would have made a difference in expanding the investigation to its fullest potential.  Locate Wanted Persons Often surveillance agents will identify people the main target of the investigation meets with and determine that they are wanted by police authorities in other jurisdictions. This information should be passed on to these authorities so that they may coordinate the arrest in such a way as to not jeopardize the ongoing drug investigation.  Verify the Reliability of an Informant Surveillance can add to the reliability of newly established CIs. Surveillance agents can corroborate certain information provided by the informant by verifying certain things during the course of a surveillance operation. If the informant says the suspect drives a certain type of vehicle, surveillance can verify this information if the suspect is seen driving the vehicle. Surveillance agents could also corroborate informant information pertaining to the description and location where the suspect lives, and the names and descriptions of people the suspect associates with. Documenting this corroboration of the informantâs information will add to the informantâs history of reliability. As the number of occasions where the informantâs information is corroborated increases, it may later sway a judge to issue a search warrant based in part on the past proven reliability of the informant.  Obtain Detailed Information Search warrants require not only probable cause to be issued, but the warrant must include a detailed description of the location to be searched. Surveillance agents can drive by or position themselves to see the location long enough to obtain a detailed, accurate description of the premises to be searched.  Prevent the Commission of a Crime or Arrest a Suspect in the Act Drug traffickers are often engaged in other criminal activity. If it should come to the attention of drug agents that the suspect intends to commit a nondrug crime such as burglary or robbery, surveillance agents can follow the suspect and make an arrest of the suspect in the act, or prevent the crime entirely.  Many police departments around the country will set up surveillance teams on recently paroled violent offenders on the assumption they will commit another violent crime. These surveillance teams often catch parolees in the act of committing a robbery or similar crime.  Obtain Information for Later Use during an Interrogation During the course of surveillance, agents will record the activities of those they follow. Later during an interrogation, if a suspect denies knowing someone or being at a particular location, surveillance notes, photographs, and videotapes may convince the suspect that it is fruitless to lie because they were seen with certain people doing certain things during a surveillance.  Develop Clues and Information from Other Sources When surveillance agents follow a suspect to locations such as a bank, stockbroker, or post office, agents can conduct a follow-up investigation to determine what relationship the suspect has with these businesses. By following the suspect to these and other locations, agents are afforded the opportunity to develop clues and information about the suspect that would not have normally been possible without surveillance. Agents may determine the suspect has a bank account at a particular bank, has an account with a stockbroker, or uses a post office box to receive personal mail. This type of information may not have been available to the informant who initiated the case and is frequently learned only through the use of surveillance.  Qualities of a Surveillance Agent Drug agents conducting surveillance must be able to fit into a crowd and avoid being noticed by their target. Besides having a normal appearance and acting naturally in their surroundings, they must be able to remain alert during long, sometimes arduous hours of work, and be resourceful when necessary. Patience and stamina are qualities they must exhibit during most of their time spent on a surveillance team.  Normal Appearance Surveillance agents must adapt to their surroundings. If they know in advance that they will be covering a meeting between a CI and the target of the investigation at an opulent hotel, the majority of them should dress accordingly. Since people from all walks of life and socio-economic backgrounds frequent hotels, even opulent ones, the manner of dress and appearance must match what they expect to find there.  Some drug agents choose to have long hair, a beard, and wear blue jeans, t-shirts, and running shoes. Agents appearing this way can still effectively conduct surveillance at upscale locations, but in limited capacities, such as street people, laborers, and the like. Common sense dictates that surveillance agents should approximate the same appearance as the suspect they are following. If the weather is warm, surveillance agents should not be the only ones on the street wearing a jacket (to conceal their weapons). Adjustments need to be made to rid themselves of the telltale signs of being the police. Ankle holsters, butt packs, notebooks, portable radios, car radio microphones, emergency lights, binoculars, cameras, handcuffs, etc. should be concealed from view and even covered up inside the agentâs vehicle. The suspectâs movements may change suddenly and the agent could find him or herself parked near the suspect as he walks by, giving him the opportunity to see surveillance equipment inside the vehicle.  Act as Naturally as Possible Inexperienced surveillance agents sometimes act as if they are wearing their badge on their shirts or have POLICE tattooed on their forehead. This is a natural response that comes from unrealistic fear that they have been spotted by the suspect, and that he knows that surveillance agents are following him. Many of these fears are later determined to be unfounded. The subject of the surveillance has no way of verifying that he is being followed by the police, and in most cases will be reluctant to confront surveillance agents.  Many suspects firmly believe they are the subjects of around-the-clock surveillance by government entities. They cannot be convinced that the government has not tapped their telephones, fax machines, homes, and businesses. These suspects are extremely fearful of going to prison for their criminal activity, and sometimes have a boost to their egos knowing that the government is devoting so much time in apprehending them. Because of the paranoia of constantly being followed, many suspects will take surreptitious routes to frequently visited places and will attempt to lose any surveillance agents that may be following them before they park at their intended destination. When such a suspect encounters a surveillance agent who is acting normally for the surroundings, he can never be sure he is being followed. More on this will be discussed later in this chapter.  In order to blend in with other people in public, surveillance agents should attempt to appear as normal as possible within their surroundings. They should not wear flashy jewelry or colorful clothing, and they should be careful not to expose any firearms or other equipment they may have on their person. Their clothing should fit prevailing weather conditions. Having several different colored caps and sunglasses to change their appearance helps them remain invisible to the suspect they are following.  Alert Often surveillance assignments can last the entire day and into the night. Agents need to prepare for such an event and have adequate amounts of water, coffee, food, and clothing to endure the day. The lack of these essential items will necessitate the agent being taken away from the rest of the surveillance team until they can be obtained.  Agents need to be alert to any sudden actions by the suspect that may change the course of the investigation. They need to be aware of telephone calls he makes at public telephone booths, businesses he visits, and people he meets with.  Surveillance agents need to obtain the telephone number of any public telephone booths the suspect makes outgoing telephone calls from. The telephone company can later determine if a toll call was made at that exact time, and what telephone number was called. This information can possibly lead to the identity of other conspirators, or provide a useful investigative lead.  When the suspect meets with an individual never encountered before, the surveillance team leader needs to make a decision about following the new person. He or she must decide if following this new person will risk draining available resources to identify him. A good rule of thumb is to make an effort to identify the new person since the opportunity may not present itself again. ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","199","2013-10-10T06:58:42","[Intel] Souces of Intelligence for DEA Agents","Discussion/Security","Using Air Support during Surveillance Many law enforcement agencies utilize aircraft to support surveillance operations. These airplanes or helicopters have proven invaluable in assisting ground surveillance follow a suspect, especially in urban areas, or over long distances.  Surveillance aircraft, manned by a pilot and a dedicated trained observer, should take the bulk of the responsibility in keeping tabs on the suspect, while ground units will be valuable once the suspect arrives at his destination.  When following the suspect on a freeway or expressway, the lead ground unit should call out landmarks and the names of exits for the benefit of the other units. In many cases, the helicopter or airplane observer will be unable to read the highway signs and will never be able to read residential street signs.  Unfortunately, aircraft have limitations such as flying in controlled airspace, running low on fuel, and the need for periodic maintenance. However, they have proven to be highly effective and successful in drug law enforcement investigations. If drug agents have the opportunity to get air support, use it!  Surveillance Notes and Reports The team leader should assign a specific agent before the surveillance is conducted to be responsible for writing a report about the activities they observe the suspect engaged in. The specific report writer should also be responsible for gathering all notes taken by other surveillance agents from which he or she will formulate the report (Figure 6.2).  Counter-Surveillance Drug agents should never underestimate the sophistication of some drug dealers. Drug traffickers realize they are in a high-risk business between dealing with other criminals to make money and having to watch out for drug agents. Drug dealers seem to be the most paranoid about being arrested or killed doing their illegal activities than any other class of criminal. (Pine Note: This is true. It's because we're also the smartest.)  Many traffickers attempt to lay their fears to rest by hiring persons to conduct counter-surveillance for them during critical, and some noncritical stages of an ongoing drug deal. Many of these same counter-surveillance types also double as body guards or provide security for the trafficker and his drugs. They are often paid in drugs instead of cash. Many are armed, all seem to have criminal backgrounds, and some are violent. Drug agents must always be cognizant of the presence of counter-surveillance at any drug deal in which they are participating.  Counter-surveillance accomplices may use hand or other visual signals such as adjusting a cap or taking off a jacket to warn others of the presence of the police. Some counter-surveillance accomplices will be on foot, others in cars and on bicycles where they can cover a larger area and be more mobile. These counter-surveillance associates of the trafficker are there to inform him what they see during the meeting, and if they detect the presence of surveillance agents.  Some traffickers themselves will sit a short distance away from the location and watch the parking lots before parking to do either a drug transaction or have a meeting with a buyer. They may telephone the undercover agent or CI after seeing them arrive at the meeting location, and lie about being several minutes away due to heavy traffic, just to see their reaction. The trafficker is looking for any contact with probable surveillance agents, no matter how slight, or anything else that will confirm he is dealing with the police. In smuggling investigations, it is increasingly common to see counter-surveillance accomplices acting suspicious at airports, train stations, and other transportation nodes hoping to attract the attention of any covert drug agents to draw attention away from the actual courier of drugs.  With cellular telephones being as prevalent as they are, traffickers will counter the efforts of electronic wiretap surveillance by changing telephone numbers frequently, or by having several telephones activated at the same time so he can rotate their use. Others use prepaid telephones and dispose of them when their time credits expire.  Counter-Surveillance Driving Many drug dealers will take a surreptitious route of travel from point A to point B. While driving, these paranoid drug dealers assume they are either always being followed, or could be followed by drug agents at any given moment. Some of their driving techniques are dangerous, others just annoying.  Drug traffickers may drive normally during a ten-mile trip, but once they come within a mile of their destination, the counter-surveillance activity commences. Surveillance agents will often observe traffickers pull into dead end streets and park to see who follows them. They will make sudden, often dangerous U-turns to see if vehicles will follow them, and drive through parking lots and corner gas stations as shortcuts.  Some traffickers painfully follow the posted speed limit to prevent being stopped by a uniformed police officer, while others use excessive speed to evade any surveillance there may be. Traffickers who enter an apartment complex will often park on the opposite side of where they live to disguise which apartment they intend to enter.  Counter-Surveillance Equipment Many stores in the United States and elsewhere specialize in selling equipment capable of detecting the presence of transmitters and wiretaps. They sell products that are purported to detect the presence of any wireless transmitter that may be on the person of someone, or can detect the presence of a listening device or bug. Many of these devices are worthless, however a growing number of them actually work well, and provide significant problems for undercover agents, informants, and surveillance agents.  A growing number of drug organizations, including money launderers, are using sophisticated electronic devices, including video equipment, mounted in the rear window of a vehicle to record any surveillance vehicles that may be following them in the hopes of observing the driver use a radio or do other things indicative of being a police official.  Pin-hole cameras are known to be mounted in flower pots, bird houses, molding, smoke detectors, and other common items to warn them that the police are present. Others may use motion detectors that activate flood lights near their homes or laboratory sites.  Suspects have also been known to use modified audible car alarms that a person conducting counter-surveillance will activate to warn persons inside a residence of the presence of the police. Pushing the button on such a device while the counter-surveillance operative has his hand in his pocket can be almost impossible to detect.  Drug dealers have also been known to purchase transceivers that not only can be programmed to monitor the frequencies of body transmitters worn by police, but can also transmit on actual police department frequencies. Suspects have been known to use police radio codes to learn the registered owners of vehicles used by police officers. This includes privately owned vehicles undercover agents use to drive to and from work everyday.  It is important when debriefing informants for the case agent to ask if the targeted drug dealer has a history of using any of these devices. If the trafficker has used these devices in the past, the undercover agent should not wear any body transmitter or recorder at the initial meeting with him. The agent may even ask to search the trafficker for any body wires he may have, just to throw him off-guard and to convince him he is not dealing with the police.  If an undercover agent knows ahead of time that the suspect will be carrying a detection device, he or she should not wear any electronic recording equipment to the initial meeting. However, if subsequent meetings take place and a recording is made, the undercover agent should make mention of the previous meeting and what was discussed to make up for the previous shortcoming. This is done in an attempt to get the suspect to acknowledge that the initial meeting took place, and that certain things were discussed and agreed upon. This will go a long way in the eyes of prosecutors and jurors in making up for the fact the original meeting was not recorded.  Summary Surveillance is used extensively by drug law enforcement to obtain intelligence information about the suspect they are following. Surveillance can be conducted either from a stationary position, while mobile, or through electronic means.  Drug agents assigned to a surveillance must be resourceful, alert, natural acting, and have an appearance that will not attract undue attention. They must be well equipped for any situation that may arise. Surveillance operations can reveal many aspects about the suspectâs life and associates he interacts with that could not otherwise be determined. Surveillance operations often lead to the identities of co-conspirators and stash houses. Many drug traffickers are on guard to detect surveillances placed upon them and will conduct countermeasures. Findings from surveillance are often used as the basis for arrest and search warrants.  Drug agents must be cognizant of counter-surveillance measures being adopted by traffickers in their jurisdictions. They have been known to use sophisticated audio and video equipment as well as scanners and transceivers to learn the identity of undercover agents. These devices are used to detect the presence of police and thwart their efforts to investigate them.  Drug dealers have also been known to employ counter-surveillance accomplices to look for the presence of strangers who may be police officers or drug agents in the neighborhood. They use hand and other signals to alert their employers of the presence of drug agents. ",""

Because all your rights go out the window when you consent. Probably works 8 or 9 out of 10 times when LE uses this tactic.  First, they follow your car out and pull you over for a minor technical violation, something small that they don't usually pull people over for, but are legally allowed to do and will do so here.  This could be: not using your turn signal, having expired registration tags, having any light on your car broken, weaving once outside the lane, having windows tinted too much, etc.   When they pull you over they will make sure to state that technical reason they pulled you over, so their ass is covered.   Then they walk up to your car and ask you a bunch of intimidating questions about where you're coming from, what you were doing at that person's house, were you buying drugs, etc.  At least half of people will just crack at this point and pull the drugs out right there and admit they got it from the dealer's house. Then they arrest you, and are now closer towards their main goal of getting a search warrant for the dealer's house.  If you don't admit you bought drugs, then they may say things like ""alright i'm just going to take a look in the car, ok?"" An indirect way of asking for consent, and if you say yes, they officially have consent and all your rights go out the window in court.  For the 1 out of 10 people who actually don't agree to a search, the cop will probably just drop it and leave. From my experience, they almost certainly do this in places that have a history of police corruption, and where the cops are now trained to be very by the book, and follow all rules accordingly.   If at this point the cops did go ahead and search the person's car, then yes you're right in a court of law it would be ruled unconstitutional.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","m0rph","21355","2014-01-31T11:07:12","protecting from sybil attacks","Discussion/Security","Any ideas on how to do this? Anyone know any good literature on the matter? Essentially a sybil attack is a node flooding attack. The attacker has an over representation of nodes in the network, and they try to deanonymize users (or do other things, depending on the context) via their unfair advantage. This sort of attack is really hard to protect from, nobody knows who runs which nodes on the internet. Some services like jondonym protect from the attack by knowing all of the node operators and knowing that they are individual people or organizations at least. Tor servers does something similar in the context of Tor. This works to a decent extent if you can know the people running nodes on a network, but even with Tor anyone is free to add nodes to the network. Tor tries to protect from massive sybil attacks by having directory authority servers that do things like blacklist IP addresses if say a thousand new nodes join at the same time. This works well to protect from naive botnet owners who may try to suddenly merge their entire botnet into the target network, but more sophisticated attackers slowly add nodes over time and it is a lot harder to link them together then. Networks like I2P don't have directory authority servers that serve this function and it makes them a lot more vulnerable to massive sybil attacks, but at the same time it removes the need for centralization. Removing the need for centralization is a great thing, but if it comes at the cost of making a network very vulnerable to sybil attacks maybe it isn't as good as it seems.   A natural protection from sybil attacks is the cost of operating an identity in the targeted network. Networks like Tor use large amounts of bandwidth and even if someone adds a dozen low bandwidth nodes they are possibly no better off than someone who adds two high bandwidth nodes. Tor limits the bandwidth that any one node can provide to the network though, so having multiple high bandwidth nodes still gives the attacker an unfair advantage. A natural bottleneck in this case is the cost of bandwidth, but what about a remailer network where bandwidth costs will never approach anything near the costs of Tor? Now we are back to a situation where the attacker can flood 12 cheap nodes and be at an advantage to an attacker with a single high bandwidth node: actual number of identities matters more than the bandwidth of a single identity. And identities are cheap. A bottleneck in the context of a mix network is still the need for multiple IP addresses and possibly multiple servers in different jurisdictions if smart routing algorithms are utilized. But what if all of the mixes are hidden services? Now they can all run on a single server, and the cost of generating new .onion addresses is essentially zero. What stops an attacker on such a network from generating 100 onion addresses and drowning out the people who add only 1?   One thing that Tor banks on is that if one attacker carries out such an attack chances are that various other attackers will do the same thing. And these attackers may not be friendly with each other, so they may not share signals intelligence with each other. This creates a scenario where multiple attackers control the vast majority of the network, but their lack of cooperation with each other prevents any of their attacks from being successful. In such a scenario the legitimate providers of resources are essentially reduced to noise: they never provide more than one identity to the network, whereas the attackers may provide hundreds of sybil identites. One possibility is having by default all nodes engage in sybil attacks, now the legitimate providers of resources also generate hundreds of onion addresses in an attempt to stay on par with potential attackers. This seems to level the playing field a little, but it is cumbersome, and we still run into the possibility of attackers having more physical servers and being able to support more onion addresses. Everybody sybils by default seems to be one potential defense from malicious sybil though.  Another possibility is proof of money spent. Bitcoin is very good for crafting such systems, as it has a public blockchain. Imagine there is a network of hidden service routers, but before anyone will trust them they most prove that they have sent money to some bitcoin address, perhaps a no mans land where it will be widely thought that the funds are irretrievable. This functions as a sort of proof of work, but it is a proof of money spent. The problem with this is that it turns away people who would otherwise participate in contributing legitimate resources to the network, and it will likely provide only a small degree of security. Say every node had to prove that they burned $250 worth of bitcoin in order for clients to trust them. Well, this certainly helps some, onion addresses are essentially free but $250 is worth $250. Now if someone wants to maliciously add 100 nodes to the network it will cost them $25,000 to do ti. Certainly this makes it less likely that many would be attackers will engage in sybil attacks, it raises the cost from nearly nothing to a decent chunk of change. But it is nothing to government level attackers, and being forced to pay $250 to contribute resources for free to a network will likely scare off a good deal of the people who would have otherwise contributed non-malicious nodes to the network. And the higher the cost of entry is, the more people it will scare off. If the cost of entry was $1,000, it would cost $100,000 to flood 100 nodes into the network, but it would probably also make it so only attackers wanted to add nodes in the first place, after all they have something to gain (intelligence) whereas volunteers are giving their resources away for free.  Standard proof of work doesn't work in this situation. If you have to spend two days generating a processing or memory based proof of work, it isn't going to do much but slow down sybil attacks. I suppose if the proof of work needs to be periodically updated that it could help protect from people doing single machine sybil attacks with onion addresses: legitimate users only need to do the proof of work once (which might take an hour of running their CPU at 100%), whereas to flood 100 nodes an attacker with the same machine would need to spend 100 hours. If the proof of work is based on a time variable that changes every 24 hours, we just put a hard limit on the number of nodes (or in this case identities) that the attacker can add to the network simultaneously with a single machine. This actually seems like a good additional defense to have, but it isn't enough to do anything other than add a fairly wide bottleneck to the abilities of the attacker. ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","21355","2014-01-31T22:30:05","protecting from sybil attacks","Discussion/Security","Your proposed ""setting money on fire"" alternative to Proof-of-Work is interesting, and probably would be somewhat difficult for some smaller adversaries to justify administratively.  It's also unlikely to be a significant hinderance to intelligence agencies/etc, but it does raise the price to play.   You nailed the downside, it makes it harder for legitimate (benign) nodes to join as well.  I smiled at the ""Everybody launches Sybil attacks all the time"" concept, but I think it nets out to no increase in resistance.   My medium sized box in a datacenter can support 100 sybil nodes, an adversary with a box ten times the size can support 1000 nodes.  1:10 = 100:1000.  I really like the idea that you can allow the user to select at least one or two ""more trusted"" nodes that the client will guarantee will be included in its path.   I'd personally prefer to be able to specify my *own* list of trusted nodes to guarantee that more than n are in my mix, but I'm guessing there are implications to that that rhyme with ""schmintersection schmattack"".   I'm guessing it's not an accident that you want to include a *class* of nodes instead of specific nodes, for just that reason.  The only ways I know of to constrain Sybil attacks is to raise their cost to the adversary in one or more of these ways: 1. Proof-of-Work - You're right.. this is an arms race the little guy loses.  Any PoW that *I* can perform before I stand a mix server up is exponentially outweighed by the PoW a large adversary can perform using their spare cycles.  2. Money - again, the little guy probably always loses this one, but it's the only one that *literally* raises the cost for the attacker  3. Time - Routing/mixing decisions preferring more mature servers.. this increases the time window for an attacker to launch an attack, but doesn't prevent anything.  4. Unquantifiable Human Effort - If you remember the 90's remailer days, remailer operators who were more active participants on cypherpunks/alt.privacy.anon-server/etc were often viewed as more trustworthy than unknown remailer operators.  You could argue that their participation in those discussions acted as an ad-hoc PoW of sorts to engender trust to other participants.  This is non quantifiable, and requires manual selection/preference of nodes in a mix to perform.   In those days, it usually wasn't some huge secret who ran which remailer, either, and the world has changed.   But paying somebody to not sound like an idiot and actually participate is probably one of those more expensive resource investments an adversary can have to pony up.  5. Gatekeeping - Restrict new node joins until the existing node owners are convinced the new node isn't malicious.   This strikes me as impossible in the architecture you're talking about.  I think your multi-class mixing idea is probably the right way for you to adjust that until you get the balance you're looking for.  You just have to define the available classes.  You can do it with bitcoin (either set on fire, or pooled).. or:  Routing Cabals You can also do it with a Routing Cabal of sorts, where you and x-many node owners (that you distrust less than strangers) band together to form a ""class"" of service.  Then maybe *I* decide you guys are shady, find y-many of my friends, and we form a different cabal.  Users could then pick between which ones they trusted more from a multi-class mix perspective.   Actually, nodes that choose to self-cluster themselves (joining a definable class of servers that controls admission to the group through a mechanism that group itself defines) would have interesting properties from an anonymity perspective, if a user could select from between 0 and 2 groups of them, with the remainder of their nodes in a path selected randomly (either from unaffiliated nodes, or from the total inventory of nodes, regardless of affiliation).  If you want a Bitcoin-burning lottery-based group, great.  You guys decide that every member of your class needs to donate $500 that gets set on fire.  Users can say, ""I like that approach.  Make sure their servers are always in the mix for my traffic"".  Another user can say, ""I think all you guys are Feds, I'll take my chances with entropy"", and have a single class of service (any random node).   A different one can say, ""I like this group here, it's made up of Riseup, CCC, and some other folks"".   Use them.  And m0rph's bitcoin-burners, for good measure.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","m0rph","21355","2014-01-31T11:59:26","protecting from sybil attacks","Discussion/Security","I suppose another possibility would be crowd funded proof of money spent. Something somewhat analgous to the tor servers organization. People can donate money on behalf of others who they trust and who wish to run nodes, and the money burned is burned from the pool of money that users of the network contribute. This is a good way to take the cost off of the volunteer who operates the node and distribute it across the user base that desires to utilize the network. It also allows for larger sums of money to be burned, which increases the cost to an attacker who doesn't have a distributed network of financial supporters. A single node operator would almost certainly not be interested in paying $1,000 to run a node, but perhaps 20 people who want to use a network protected from sybil attacks would be willing to donate $50 to a trusted volunteer (of course this brings up the issue of how can you trust a volunteer? what prevents volunteer sybil attacks?).   Another possibility would be a lottery system of trust, but done in a decentralized and provably honest way. People who are willing to run nodes create a proof that they have burned $5 and in exchange for this they get a ticket. Periodically a provably fair lottery is held and one of the tickets is selected as trusted, allowing the holder to run a node that clients identify as trusted. The unfair advantage that an attacker could get would correlate directly with the amount of money they spent on buying tickets. This has the disadvantage of allowing an attacker with enough money to probabilistically prevent any other entity from running any nodes at all. But if we imagine theoretically a network with 50,000 users who burn $5 a month in the node selection scheme, with one node being selected as trusted every month, it would cost an attacker then $250,000 a month to have a 50% chance of adding a new sybil node to the network that month. Or if more nodes are needed, it could cost $1.25 a week, and then the attacker would need to spend $62,500 a week to have a 50% chance of adding a new node to the network that week. Only a very powerful attacker would be willing to keep that up for many months, it would cost millions of dollars a year for an attacker to sybil the network with any significant degree of success, but would cost users of the network only $65 or so a year, which isn't necessarily a high price to pay to be so well protected from sybil attacks.   Another possibility is a mixture of this and allowing anyone to add nodes as well, with the routing algorithm selecting to use at least one trusted-via-lottery node on each messages path. Keep in mind that mix networks don't really need very many nodes on them, and a single good node on your messages path provides you with significant anonymity. If your message travels over 4 randomly selected nodes from a pool of all nodes, and 1 trusted node that won the mix lottery, it may provide the best of both worlds in adding a steep cost to mortal sybil attacks while still allowing for a substantial selection of mixes to select from. Sybil could be less effectively protected from on the other nodes via various means, processing proof of work per day to set a basic bottleneck, and the other things I discussed.   At the end of the day a mix network like this could at the very least be used for strongly secure and anonymous E-mail (although that is barely touching on the potential of mix networks), I'm not sure it would be unreasonable to expect users to provably destroy $65 a year to protect from one of the most difficult to defend from attacks against such networks. The problem then would also be that it takes a certain degree of skill and also costs money to operate a mix node, but if only one new one is added per month it would be a cost that could easily be decentralized as well.   Anyway I am just brainstorming here, if anyone can think of good methods to protect from sybil attacks please share, or if you can think of any flaws in any of the methods I proposed feel free to share those as well.

But this is a radical, disheartening development in the history of the organisation, long held out as a beacon for the open, free spirit of the web as a tool for liberation.As Galâs blogpost makes clear, this move was done without much enthusiasm, out of a fear that Firefox (Mozillaâs flagship product and by far the most popular free/open browser in the world) was being sidelined by Apple, Google and Microsoftâs inclusion of proprietary technology to support Netflix and other DRM-encumbered videos in their browsers.In my long-running discussions with Mozillaâs most senior management over this issue, theyâve been clear in their belief that their userbase â and relevance to the internet â will dwindle unless they add support for viewing Hollywood movies in their browser. Not just Hollywood; the BBC has been one of the major ârights holderâ voices calling for the addition of DRM to the web.This shift is part of a change in the way that browsers work in general. Since the early days of the Netscape browser, third-party plug-ins have been a common way to extend browser functionality. Users who wanted to watch DRM-restricted video could install proprietary plugins such as Microsoftâs Silverlight or Adobeâs Flash.The plug-in architecture is a security nightmare, and a source of numerous breaches through which buggy or malicious code was able to reach into usersâ computers and compromise them. Now that browsers run in computers that we carry around in our pockets, connected to microphones and video cameras, and manage everything from our finance to our thermostats, abolishing plug-ins was an inevitable and welcome step.Plugged back inHowever, in the absence of plug-ins, the proprietary browser companies have privately negotiated with Netflix to add DRM. This shift to private negotiations â instead of industry-wide standards â spooked the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and its founder, web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, into a controversial plan to add DRM to HTML5, the next-generation web standard.The W3Câs solution is baroque: it is specifying something called âencrypted media extensionsâ through which the browser creates a âsandboxâ within which a âcontent decryption moduleâ (CDM) operates, receiving scrambled video, descrambling it and passing it out of the sandbox for display.At times, the W3C has insisted that this isnât really DRM â itâs a thing that can be used for DRM. The fact that it was conceived in order to respond to demand for DRM from companies that insist on DRM for their business-models, and that its deployment and use is entirely concerned with DRM, makes this a pretty thin excuse.The fear of irrelevance that drove Mozilla to add DRM is a microcosm of the fear of irrelevance that drove the W3C to standardise DRM. By the same token, Mozillaâs roundabout description of its DRM plan also echoes some of the W3Câs not-really-DRM claims.Mozilla says it isnât providing DRM; itâs providing a fully open utility that automatically fetches and installs DRM from Adobeâs servers. I am unconvinced that there is a meaningful distinction between âinstalling DRMâ and âinstalling code that installs DRMâ.Still, Mozilla has taken some admirable pains to minimise the harms from its DRM. The open sandbox in which Adobeâs software operates very strictly limits the DRMâs access to the computerâs other processes and systems. This is crucial, because the Adobe module is not only closed source, it is also protected by controversial global laws that threaten security researchers who publish information about its security flaws.These laws â the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the European EUCD, Canadaâs C-11 and so on â prohibit revealing information that can be used to weaken DRM, and previous security researchers who disclosed information about vulnerabilities in DRM have been threatened and prosecuted.This created a chilling effect on the publication of vulnerabilities in DRM, even where these put users at risk from hackers. For example, when word got out that Sony BMG had infected millions of computers with an illegal rootkit to stop (legal) audio CD ripping, security researchers stepped forward to disclose that theyâd known about the rootkit but had been afraid to say anything about it.This gap between discovery and disclosure allowed the Sony rootkit to become a global pandemic that infected hundreds of thousands of US military and government networks. Virus writers used the Sony rootkit to cloak their own software and attack vulnerable systems.The inclusion of Adobeâs DRM in Firefox means that Mozilla will be putting millions of its users in a position where they are running code whose bugs are illegal to report. So itâs very important that this code be as isolated as possible.By open-sourcing the sandbox that limits the Adobe softwareâs access to the system, Mozilla is making it auditable and verifiable. This is a much better deal than users will get out of any of the rival browsers, like Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer, and it is a meaningful and substantial difference.Unhappy turnItâs clear that Mozilla isnât happy about this turn of events, and in our conversations, people there characterised it as something theyâd been driven to by the entertainment companies and the complicity of the commercial browser vendors, who have enthusiastically sold out their usersâ integrity and security.Mitchell Baker, the executive chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, told me that âthis is not a happy day for the webâ and âitâs not in line with the values that weâre trying to build. This does not match our value set.âBut both she and Gal were adamant that they felt that they had no choice but to add DRM if they were going to continue Mozillaâs overall mission of keeping the web free and open.I am sceptical about this claim. I don't doubt that itâs sincerely made, but I found the case for it weak. When I pressed Gal for evidence that without Netflix Firefox users would switch away, he cited the huge volume of internet traffic generated by Netflix streams.There's no question that Netflix video and other video streams account for an appreciable slice of the internetâs overall traffic. But video streams are also the bulkiest files to transfer. That video streams use a lot of bytes isn't a surprise.When a charitable nonprofit like Mozilla makes a shift as substantial as this one â installing closed-source software designed to treat computer users as untrusted adversaries â youâd expect there to be a data-driven research story behind it, meticulously documenting the proposition that without DRM irrelevance is inevitable. The large number of bytes being shifted by Netflix is a poor proxy for that detailed picture.There are other ways in which Mozillaâs DRM is better for user freedom than its commercial competitorsâ. While the commercial browsersâ DRM assigns unique identifiers to users that can be used to spy on viewing habits across multiple video providers and sessions, the Mozilla DRM uses different identifiers for different services.And unlike the commercial browsersâ DRM, the Mozilla implementation does not intentionally leak any information about the userâs system or its configuration to video services.The Mozilla DRM is a very neat illustration of the difference between âfreeâ and âopenâ, a distinction that often seems abstract to the point of meaninglessness for most people.Mozillaâs open-source sandbox can be examined and compiled by users who have access to its source code. It is fully transparent and âopenâ to them.But if users modify the sandbox in any way â if they add new features or improvements to it â the Adobe plug-in can detect the alteration and it will refuse to pass any more decoded video. The Mozilla sandbox comes with total openness, but without any of the freedoms that the free software movement cherishes.How the Adobe module validates the sandbox is a mystery â a proprietary technique whose workings are illegal to report, thanks to the same laws that ban reporting vulnerabilities in DRM.I was surprised to learn that there was a GNU/Linux version of Adobeâs module that will work with Firefox on systems running Ubuntu, Red Hat and related operating systems.This seems unlikely to work very well: whatever techniques the module is using to assure itself that the sandbox is behaving as expected ultimately depend on it asking the operating system questions about the sandbox (âis the sandbox running as a process that canât access the hard drive?â).A user who can modify her operating system can easily get it to lie to the Adobe software â we do this all the time, such as when a cheap digital recorder pretends to be a mass storage device to your computer so that it can access its stored recordings.The Mozilla Project has been one of the internetâs most hopeful success stories, and the people who do Mozillaâs good works have been personal heroes of mine for more than a decade.The decision to produce systems that treat internet users as untrusted adversaries to be controlled by their computers was clearly taken out of a sense of desperation and inevitability.Itâs clear that Mozilla plans to do everything it can to mitigate the harms from its DRM strategy and to attempt to reverse the trend that brought it to this pass.Like many of Mozillaâs longtime supporters, I hold it to a high standard. It is not a for-profit. Itâs a social enterprise with a mission to empower and free its users.I understand that Apple, Microsoft and Google are for-profit entities that have demonstrated repeatedly that their profitability trumps their customersâ rights, and I fault them for this. But itâs not unreasonable to hold mission-driven nonprofits to a higher standard than their commercial counterparts.Mozilla says itâs doing everything it can to reduce the harm from what it sees as an inevitable decision. As a Mozilla supporter, contributor and user, I want it to do more. Here are some practical things that Mozilla can do to help:1 Protect security researchersMozilla has demonstrated that it has some negotiating leverage with Adobe â after all, it was able to fend off the demand for details of usersâ systems to be leaked to video companies.It should demand that Adobe give it a covenant not to sue or threaten developers who report vulnerabilities in the Adobe decoder. Adobe does not need to give up the right to sue people who release cracks for their DRM or competing products in order to do this.In an era in which vulnerabilities are leveraged to expose users to identity theft, sexual exploitation and government surveillance, no one should fear legal reprisal for warning people about flaws in the software they use.Mozillaâs competitors don't do offer this protection to developers. They should. Mozilla can shame them for not doing so, and be the leader we want it to be.2 Educate usersMozilla has a brilliant, far-reaching technology literacy programme that teaches users how to be makers and programmers and how to be safe and private on the Web.Mozilla should develop a curriculum about the way that DRM undermines security by making vulnerability reporting illegal and treating users as hostile adversaries.And it should teach would-be makers that DRM only allows you to be a passive viewer and not a tinkerer, because if you change the âopenâ decoder, it stops working.3 Research and publish the case for DRMWith both the W3C and Mozilla ready to add DRM in order to preserve their relevance in the face of Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer and Amazon Video, we need some actual data on how users view these service and to what precise extent the lack of in-built DRM support is enough to drive away users.If Mozilla wants its supporters to accept that irrelevance was the inevitable alternative to DRM, it should have the data to back that up. We can use that data to inform anti-DRM strategies.4 Formulate and articulate a DRM policyThere are lots of industries that want the W3C to standardise DRM for them, too.The ebook people have asked for a W3C standard to lock up formatted text â basically, webpages â and I wouldn't be surprised to see paywall sites and others converging on this.Gal told me he didnât think that users would accept DRM for text in the same way that theyâve accepted DRM for video, pointing out that most text is not DRMed.However, nearly all the video on the web today is DRM-free â YouTube users alone post 96 hoursâ worth of DRM-free video every minute.Itâs only a small slice of âpremiumâ video that is locked up with DRM, in the same way that only a small slice of text â commercial books, paywalled newspapers â would likely be DRMed if the ebook people get their W3C DRM.The promulgation of DRM video on the web is the beginning, not the end. If Mozilla wants long-term support from its stakeholders, it canât make decisions about future DRM fights on an ad hoc basis.We need a statement of principles that explains when DRM is the right answer â itâs certainly a debate Iâd relish participating in.Mozilla wonât comment on whether its forthcoming Firefox OS for mobile devices will be born with DRM, and that's an ominous sign for those of us who were hoping for a free/open alternative to the existing mobile infrastructure, which is basically a global surveillance system that allows us to make the occasional phone call.Like many of Mozillaâs supporters â and like many of the Mozillans I know and respect â I am devastated by this turn of events. The free and open web needs an entity like Mozilla to stand on principle, especially when the commercial internet world so manifestly stands on nothing but profits.I fully accept that Baker and Gal have taken this decision reluctantly and unhappily. I disagree with their rationale, but I understand it. And I accept that they have gone to enormous lengths to devise a DRM with as few harms as possible.But there is more that Mozilla can do, and should do, even if theyâre wrong that DRM is the only way â and especially if theyâre right."

I have been following it for a little while now and there are a number of reasons why i find it so interesting. The possibility of a decentralized marketplace literally makes my willy fizz! What are your thoughts? Does it have potential? I really think it might. Here are some passages from the Nextcoin Wiki.      ******************************CLEARNET WARNING******************************  https://nextcoin.org/ http://wiki.nxtcrypto.org/wiki/Main_Page http://coinchomp.com/2013/12/22/seven-reasons-to-check-out-nextcoin/ http://www.coinwith.me/project/next-coin/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zALTChPsXhQ ","What is Nextcoin?Nxt is considered a second-generation cryptocurrency. With all the altcoins coming out that only change things such as hashing mechanism, time between blocks, starting difficulty, and so on, Nxt brings much much more to the table and was designed this way for a number of reasons:1. It is not an ""alt coin"" like coins such as litecoin, peercoin, and others who have their code based on Bitcoin 's source code.  It is brand new from scratch with its own code.2. It provides built in support for planned extra features such as a decentralized peer-peer exchange, colored coins, messaging/chat, decentralized DNS, and options for instant transactions.3. It is a 100% proof of stake (PoS) versus the proof of work (PoW) mechanism the vast majority of other coins are based on.  This effectively removes a large security risk inherent in most other coins, as the issue of a 51% attack or other vulnerabilities inherent to PoW coins is gone.  The biggest plus here is how ""green"" this protocol is in terms of power consumption, since PoS doesnât require massive amounts of hashing power4. It was announced weeks in advance, unlike mere hours like most coins.  The 73 stakeholders are responsible for distributing the 1 billion Nxt coins that were ejected from the genesis block via an injection of bitcoin (donated by them, 21 BTC total) into the genesis block.  This is a requirement for this PoS system to work and this distribution is now in progress.  Nxt is listed on http://coinmarketcap.com/ and people are trading on a 1-on-1 basis in the forums as well as on a temporary (centralized) exchange http://www.dgex.com.    5. When released for production in Jan 2014, Nxt will have a very slick new feature called ""Transparent Mining"", which will allow each user's client to automatically determine who will generate the next block, so that they can then send their transactions to that node. This will also allow additional fees to be realized for immediate/priority transactions. An equally important feature of Transparent Mining is an outstanding security feature of the protocol to temporarily reduce to zero the mining power of nodes who should generate the next block but don't. This transparent mining feature will prevent against even a 90% majority owner of all NXT branching out and forcing a fork. So if a node that has 90% of all NXT, and doesn't generate a block when scheduled, the system will reduce its mining power to zero temporarily to prevent a bad fork from being forced.;Current FeaturesUnlike other cryptocurrencies, Nxt was written from scratch and is based on all-new code.  Nxt improves upon many of the features of Bitcoin, removes some disadvantages (e.g. bloated blockchain) and resolves a big environmental issue.  Time between blocks is one minute.  This increases the rate of orphaned blocks but makes it more convenient for the users.Limited supply1 billion Nxt coins were generated in the first block, and no new Nxt coins will be created.  Coins are not ""mined"" like they are with other currencies.100% Proof-of-Stake currencyNxt is the first 100% Proof-of-Stake (PoS) currency.  Coins are earned solely by charging transaction fees.  Unlike other currencies with Proof-of-Stake mining, however, Nxt's PoS mining does not cause monetary inflation.Transparent miningNxt will implement a novel ""transparent mining"" system that will temporarily penalize accounts that do not participate in the proof-of-stake block verification process.  This will encourage holders of non-trivial amounts of Nxt to actively participate in the network, instead of merely holding a balance in order to collect transmission fees.  More information about this feature can be found in this Bitcointalk thread .Brain walletAll Nxt account information is stored on the network.  Using a secret passphrase, an account can be accessed from any instance of the Nxt software.    Alias SystemNxt implements an alias system that translates alphaneumeric text into almost anything: Nxt account addresses, email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, SKU codes, and more. This not only gives Nxt the ability to function as a Decentralized DNS system, but adds additional possibilities for mapping short names to other entities.Fast transaction processingNxt does not use ""scripts"" (or predicates), which simplifies and accelerates transaction processing.  Advanced features (such as multisig ) will be created on top of the Nxt core as third-party services.Blocks are generated once per minute.;Planned FeaturesCurrency ExchangeTo exchange cryptocoins right now, you have to sign up for an account on a centralized platform such as Cryptsy/BTC-E/Bter/etc, transfer coins to them and then pay them for transactions. This brings in a large concern: itâs possible that the exchange could just bail with everyone's deposits. This recently happened when the Sheep Marketplace did just that with 96,000 bitcoins. The developers of Nxt are developing a peer-peer exchange into the software to allow for decentralized trading which will eliminate this trust point. It will also eliminate trading fees! Obviously this is all still completely secure and anonymous as are current bitcoin transactions.Colored coinsUnderstanding the concept of colored coins requires a fairly deep view into the mechanics of bitcoin transactions. With bitcoin, each transaction's output hashed address is based on a previous receiving address that originally received that coin. So with the blockchain, a set of bitcoin transactions can be traced: an individual coin or pieces of that coin can be traced back on a transaction by transaction basis. Since this is the case, if it were possible to expand the protocol to allow a person to designate or ""color"" a particular coin, then we could build a bridge from the virtual crypto-currency world to the physical world. In effect that coin could then be used to represent some physical entity here on earth. Property, stocks/bonds, commodites, or really any concept that can be concretely identified could be used, meaning that the Nxt network could be used to trade almost anything.Asset ExchangeA built-in mechanism for trading assets. The API is likely to be completed in mid-January, with a software client released at the end of January.MarketplaceArbitrary MessagesPlanned to be implemented at a block height of 30,000 blocksVoting System"

Hypothetically one simple way to do it is to automatically generate ""x"" amount of bitcoin addresses and their keys in a programming language(such as C++), store all the addresses in an array, figure out some calculation that can randomly split the coins up, distribute them, and just keep doing this, moving them in random amounts, and then eventually put them all back up into a single address.Hypothetically, If you wanted to get to a further level of complexity, you could store all of your coins in 5000+ different wallets that you generate, have your program account for  and keep track of them all, and consider the amount unified. It could display a total balance of all the wallets added together and if you send X amount of bitcoins out of the wallet, it could calculate them and pull the correct total amount in random increments from many of the wallets. You could also make the program able to receive deposits at one address and automatically split it and store it in several other addresses. This is just theory, but the logic is sound and straight forward. Though, I am not a bitcoin mechanics expert. I'm more tuned to the economic side. I would need to know more about how bitcoin network transaction fees work before I can give you a definitive answer on whether or not the above model is viable. I'm honestly surprised there is not more tumbling sites available. If I spent my time researching I could probably put one together and easily charge far less than Fog."

I don't honestly know enough about the bitcoin protocol to get all the ins and outs by any stretch, but I do know that if Wall Street didn't see bitcoin as a cash cow before, they do now, and the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" is made up of people who want to work with them.  darkwallet is a practical way to ensure truly anonymous bitcoin transfers by basically mixing everyone's transactions together using the CoinJoin protocol.  There is already an implementation of CoinJoin written by a couple of darkwallet's founders.  They are now writing one to work in the firefox browser.  Imagine making free, anonymous bitcoin payments using your browser's toolbar!  These are some of the planned features:  Auto-anonymiser for your Bitcoins. Broadcasters to avoid triangulation of your financial transactions. Automatic fee discovery. Ability to set a tradeoff between confirmation time and fee size. Decentralised market discovery mechanisms. Distributed identity. Distributed reputation. Encrypted messaging. Private asset issuance. Decentralised trading   Distributed reputation is like Silk Road feedback that can never be taken down.  Imagine that shit! ","Here's the thing:While it may be possible to try to trace the origin of certain coins to a black market, if somebody receives coins in a legitimate fashion, it is not their fault if those coins went through the black market. Such a model as above would render bitcoin useless more or less, and the company trying to declare bad/good cons would self-collapse.Another reason it wouldn't work is because bitcoin tumblrs are not as complex to build as people think. They're not easy, granted, but anyone with an understanding of bitcoin and some programming knowledge can put one together. The only reason they are needed right now is for sites like this, mostly. If that company tried to declare good/bad bitcoins there would be a greater collective effort to release public bitcoin tumbling software. Honestly, anybody could have a software that auto generates bitcoin addresses and tumbles coins through them. Such a software, if made public, could be entirely free and could be used endlessly and can be used to tumble cons to a potentially infinite degree of complexity, if fees are not involved. Such a program would not be hard to create either. I'm sure someone has done it for private use. Anyone can create as many bitcoin addresses as they want and tumbling is merely a matter of mixing bitcoins through addresses. I don't think they will succeed. That is just my 2 cents."

(BitFuckers) are actively working with law enforcement and big finance-tied government regulators to drastically change bitcoin into a regulated, bloated, over-complex mess with ""bad"" bitcoins and ""good"" bitcoins.  ""bad"" bitcoins are ones that have supposedly flowed through a black market site like SR2.  Their goal is really to turn bitcoin into a company controlled by the BitFuckers that will totally control the bitcoin software, its future, and ultimately, the profits when they sell the whole thing off to the financial sector on Wall Street.darkwallet is a brilliant design:  think bittorrent for coin tumbling/mixing.  everyone connects within a fully encrypted network (the bitcoin network) to locate others looking to transact similar amounts and mixes their coins by sending each payment to the other transaction's destination.  Totally free, totally anonymous, totally all the time forever.What will happen if the ""Bitcoin Foundation"" wins, which I assume means they convince a majority of miners and full bitcoin clients (?) to use their bitcoin implementation, is that black market transactions with bitcoin will no longer be possible.Unless darkwallet succeeds.  darkwallet has a huge advantage over the good/bad coin insanity because the darkwallet design works with bitcoin's existing design, while the BitFuckers design cuts against the flow in many ways.  Some think the BitFucker idea can't really work, which I think might be true.  The problem is that it may not matter if it works as long as politically, the independent bitcoin developers like the darkwallet team are kept outside of future design and development talks.  The government and wall street will then control bitcoin and it will die for everyone but the wealthy.Now, if this happens, we'll all just likely move on and use litecoin, or darkwallet's team can fit their system onto another currency, and all those who are invested in bitcoins now may lose their funds if its determined their coins ""came from a tainted source"".  But do we really want to let the multinational criminal corporate cartel take bitcoin away from us?  Its not theirs.  They already have their USD and their GBP and goddamned bonds and stocks and all that other shit they invented to skim off their massive take from the global fucked-up economy.  Hell government-corporate central banks create their fiat currencies out of thin air to bathe in with each other every day to the tune of billions of dollars.  And now that bitcoin has become a massive success (and by any estimation its a fucking blockbuster), Wall Street is licking its chops and drooling over all the money it can ""earn"" by owning the bitcoin infrastructure.  darkwallet may mean that BitcoinFog will go away (or not).  But they've made a bundle off grabbing an opportunity first and its time for that system to become free and fully socialized.Completely anonymous bitcoin transactions forever versus Goldman Sachs Bitcoin Fuckers, Inc.  darkwallet has the plan.  and its way more fantastic than I've been able to explain, with many more amazing features and plans for expansion.  Read their home page.  Its clearnet but you can view it on Tor no problem.****CLEARNET WARNING*****https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/****CLEARNET WARNING*****I don't know how far along they are in development, but they have the expertise and the determination so with some support I imagine they can succeed."

And now for the first time, a clear majority of Americans (58%) say the drug should be legalized. This is in sharp contrast to the time Gallup first asked the question in 1969, when only 12% favored legalization. Public support for legalization more than doubled in the 1970s, growing to 28%. It then plateaued during the 1980s and 1990s before inching steadily higher since 2000, reaching 50% in 2011.  A sizable percentage of Americans (38%) this year admitted to having tried the drug, which may be a contributing factor to greater acceptance.  Success at the ballot box in the past year in Colorado and Washington may have increased Americans' tolerance for marijuana legalization. Support for legalization has jumped 10 percentage points since last November and the legal momentum shows no sign of abating. Last week, California's second-highest elected official, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, said that pot should be legal in the Golden State, and advocates of legalization are poised to introduce a statewide referendum in 2014 to legalize the drug.  The Obama administration has also been flexible on the matter. Despite maintaining the government's firm opposition to legalizing marijuana under federal law, in late August Deputy Attorney General James Cole announced the Justice Department would not challenge the legality of Colorado's and Washington's successful referendums, provided that those states maintain strict rules regarding the drug's sale and distribution.  The movement to legalize marijuana mirrors the relatively recent success of the movement to legalize gay marriage, which voters have also approved now in 14 states. Public support for gay marriage, which Americans also overwhelmingly opposed in the past, has increased dramatically, reaching majority support in the last two years.  Independents Fueling Growth in Acceptance of Legalizing Marijuana  Independents' growing support for legalization has mostly driven the jump in Americans' overall support. Sixty-two percent of independents now favor legalization, up 12 points from November 2012. Support for legalization among Democrats and Republicans saw little change. Yet there is a marked divide between Republicans, who still oppose legalizing marijuana, and Democrats and independents. Young Adults More Likely to Support Legalization  Americans 65 and older are the only age group that still opposes legalizing marijuana. Still, support among this group has jumped 14 percentage points since 2011.  In contrast, 67% of Americans aged 18 to 29 back legalization. Clear majorities of Americans aged 30 to 64 also favor legalization.  Americansâ Views on Legalizing Marijuana, by Age Bottom Line  It has been a long path toward majority acceptance of marijuana over the past 44 years, but Americans' support for legalization accelerated as the new millennium began. This acceptance of a substance that most people might have considered forbidden in the late 1960s and 1970s may be attributed to changing social mores and growing social acceptance. The increasing prevalence of medical marijuana as a socially acceptable way to alleviate symptoms of diseases such as arthritis, and as a way to mitigate side effects of chemotherapy, may have also contributed to Americans' growing support.  Whatever the reasons for Americans' greater acceptance of marijuana, it is likely that this momentum will spur further legalization efforts across the United States. Advocates of legalizing marijuana say taxing and regulating the drug could be financially beneficial to states and municipalities nationwide. But detractors such as law enforcement and substance abuse professionals have cited health risks including an increased heart rate, and respiratory and memory problems.  With Americans' support for legalization quadrupling since 1969, and localities on the East Coast such as Portland, Maine, considering a symbolic referendum to legalize marijuana, it is clear that interest in this drug and these issues will remain elevated in the foreseeable future.",""

CLEARNET:  NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption)  ","The National Security Agency has made repeated attempts to develop attacks against people using Tor, a popular tool designed to protect online anonymity, despite the fact the software is primarily funded and promoted by the US government itself.Top-secret NSA documents, disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, reveal that the agency's current successes against Tor rely on identifying users and then attacking vulnerable software on their computers. One technique developed by the agency targeted the Firefox web browser used with Tor, giving the agency full control over targets' computers, including access to files, all keystrokes and all online activity.But the documents suggest that the fundamental security of the Tor service remains intact. One top-secret presentation, titled 'Tor Stinks', states: ""We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time."" It continues: ""With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users,"" and says the agency has had ""no success de-anonymizing a user in response"" to a specific request.Another top-secret presentation calls Tor ""the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity"".Tor â which stands for The Onion Router â is an open-source public project that bounces its users' internet traffic through several other computers, which it calls ""relays"" or ""nodes"", to keep it anonymous and avoid online censorship tools.It is relied upon by journalists, activists and campaigners in the US and Europe as well as in China, Iran and Syria, to maintain the privacy of their communications and avoid reprisals from government. To this end, it receives around 60% of its funding from the US government, primarily the State Department and the Department of Defense â which houses the NSA.Despite Tor's importance to dissidents and human rights organizations, however, the NSA and its UK counterpart GCHQ have devoted considerable efforts to attacking the service, which law enforcement agencies say is also used by people engaged in terrorism, the trade of child abuse images, and online drug dealing.Privacy and human rights groups have been concerned about the security of Tor following revelations in the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica about widespread NSA efforts to undermine privacy and security software. A report by Brazilian newspaper Globo also contained hints that the agencies had capabilities against the network.While it seems that the NSA has not compromised the core security of the Tor software or network, the documents detail proof-of-concept attacks, including several relying on the large-scale online surveillance systems maintained by the NSA and GCHQ through internet cable taps.One such technique is based on trying to spot patterns in the signals entering and leaving the Tor network, to try to de-anonymise its users. The effort was based on a long-discussed theoretical weakness of the network: that if one agency controlled a large number of the ""exits"" from the Tor network, they could identify a large amount of the traffic passing through it.The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated in the documents would rely on the NSA's cable-tapping operation, and the agency secretly operating computers, or 'nodes', in the Tor system. However, one presentation stated that the success of this technique was ""negligible"" because the NSA has ""access to very few nodes"" and that it is ""difficult to combine meaningfully with passive Sigint"".While the documents confirm the NSA does indeed operate and collect traffic from some nodes in the Tor network, they contain no detail as to how many, and there are no indications that the proposed de-anonymization technique was ever implemented.Other efforts mounted by the agencies include attempting to direct traffic toward NSA-operated servers, or attacking other software used by Tor users. One presentation, titled 'Tor: Overview of Existing Techniques', also refers to making efforts to ""shape"", or influence, the future development of Tor, in conjunction with GCHQ.Another effort involves measuring the timings of messages going in and out of the network to try to identify users. A third attempts to degrade or disrupt the Tor service, forcing users to abandon the anonymity protection.Such efforts to target or undermine Tor are likely to raise legal and policy concerns for the intelligence agencies.Foremost among those concerns is whether the NSA has acted, deliberately or inadvertently, against internet users in the US when attacking Tor. One of the functions of the anonymity service is to hide the country of all of its users, meaning any attack could be hitting members of Tor's substantial US user base.Several attacks result in implanting malicious code on the computer of Tor users who visit particular websites. The agencies say they are targeting terrorists or organized criminals visiting particular discussion boards, but these attacks could also hit journalists, researchers, or those who accidentally stumble upon a targeted site.The efforts could also raise concerns in the State Department and other US government agencies that provide funding to increase Tor's security â as part of the Obama administration's internet freedom agenda to help citizens of repressive regimes â circumvent online restrictions.Material published online for a discussion event held by the State Department, for example, described the importance of tools such as Tor.""[T]he technologies of internet repression, monitoring and control continue to advance and spread as the tools that oppressive governments use to restrict internet access and to track citizen online activities grow more sophisticated. Sophisticated, secure, and scalable technologies are needed to continue to advance internet freedom.""The Broadcasting Board of Governors, a federal agency whose mission is to ""inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy"" through networks such as Voice of America, also supported Tor's development until October 2012 to ensure that people in countries such as Iran and China could access BBG content. Tor continues to receive federal funds through Radio Free Asia, which is funded by a federal grant from BBG.The governments of both these countries have attempted to curtail Tor's use: China has tried on multiple occasions to block Tor entirely, while one of the motives behind Iranian efforts to create a ""national internet"" entirely under government control was to prevent circumvention of those controls.The NSA's own documents acknowledge the service's wide use in countries where the internet is routinely surveilled or censored. One presentation notes that among uses of Tor for ""general privacy"" and ""non-attribution"", it can be used for ""circumvention of nation state internet policies"" â and is used by ""dissidents"" in ""Iran, China, etc"".Yet GCHQ documents show a disparaging attitude towards Tor users. One presentation acknowledges Tor was ""created by the US government"" and is ""now maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)"", a US freedom of expression group. In reality, Tor is maintained by an independent foundation, though has in the past received funding from the EFF.The presentation continues by noting that ""EFF will tell you there are many pseudo-legitimate uses for Tor"", but says ""we're interested as bad people use Tor"". Another presentation remarks: ""Very naughty people use Tor"".The technique developed by the NSA to attack Tor users through vulnerable software on their computers has the codename EgotisticalGiraffe, the documents show. It involves exploiting the Tor browser bundle, a collection of programs, designed to make it easy for people to install and use the software. Among these is a version of the Firefox web browser.The trick, detailed in a top-secret presentation titled 'Peeling back the layers of Tor with EgotisticalGiraffe', identified website visitors who were using the protective software and only executed its attack â which took advantage of vulnerabilities in an older version of Firefox â against those people. Under this approach, the NSA does not attack the Tor system directly. Rather, targets are identified as Tor users and then the NSA attacks their browsers.According to the documents provided by Snowden, the particular vulnerabilities used in this type of attack were inadvertently fixed by Mozilla Corporation in Firefox 17, released in November 2012 â a fix the NSA had not circumvented by January 2013 when the documents were written.The older exploits would, however, still be usable against many Tor users who had not kept their software up to date.A similar but less complex exploit against the Tor network was revealed by security researchers in July this year. Details of the exploit, including its purpose and which servers it passed on victims' details to, led to speculation it had been built by the FBI or another US agency.At the time, the FBI refused to comment on whether it was behind the attack, but subsequently admitted in a hearing in an Irish court that it had operated the malware to target an alleged host of images of child abuse â though the attack did also hit numerous unconnected services on the Tor network.Roger Dingledine, the president of the Tor project, said the NSA's efforts serve as a reminder that using Tor on its own is not sufficient to guarantee anonymity against intelligence agencies â but showed it was also a great aid in combating mass surveillance.""The good news is that they went for a browser exploit, meaning there's no indication they can break the Tor protocol or do traffic analysis on the Tor network,"" Dingledine said. ""Infecting the laptop, phone, or desktop is still the easiest way to learn about the human behind the keyboard.""Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody's going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on.""But he added: ""Just using Tor isn't enough to keep you safe in all cases. Browser exploits, large-scale surveillance, and general user security are all challenging topics for the average internet user. These attacks make it clear that we, the broader internet community, need to keep working on better security for browsers and other internet-facing applications.""The Guardian asked the NSA how it justified attacking a service funded by the US government, how it ensured that its attacks did not interfere with the secure browsing of law-abiding US users such as activists and journalists, and whether the agency was involved in the decision to fund Tor or efforts to ""shape"" its development.The agency did not directly address those questions, instead providing a statement.It read: ""In carrying out its signals intelligence mission, NSA collects only those communications that it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes, regardless of the technical means used by those targets or the means by which they may attempt to conceal their communications. NSA has unmatched technical capabilities to accomplish its lawful mission. ""As such, it should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract targets' use of technologies to hide their communications. Throughout history, nations have used various methods to protect their secrets, and today terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers and others use technology to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.""â¢ This article was amended on 4 October after the Broadcasting Board of Governors pointed out that its support of Tor ended in October 2012.â¢ Bruce Schneier is an unpaid member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's board of directors. He has not been involved in any discussions on funding."

Combine that with any address that wasn't an actual legal destination, whether it's return receipt or destination, would really be getting suspicious IMHO.  Obviously they can't monitor everything this way, but they have the system in place to do it automatically for a whole lot of mail already.  Why not use it?  The reason that an address doesn't exist could be (at least) that it's a brand new residence (which is unlikely, as I believe companies actually get paid to provide updates like that to USPS); or, perhaps the person wrote a 3 when they meant a 5 (happens, but not very often, especially not when you're using automated software and should be shipping things with the same return address every time the way 95% of business mail does); or, what seems much more likely, is that someone didn't want to be able to recover their valuable mail that they've paid you to make sure gets to somebody.  Now why on Earth could someone not want to be able to recover something valuable enough to send it through the mail, hmm... I wonder...    I don't know.  Just my layman's opinion.  Although, if I'm honest, I did find the way you've made up a [SHITLIST] tag and even closed it properly rather amusing... that may not be valid in HTML, but it's perfectly valid XML.  Cute joke -- I got it, anyway  ","It does not matter if you use e postage from the usps website as long as the sender uses real return address and names.

Your coins will be added to a bunch of  other random coins from other users and tumbled. Then fresh coins, equaling the amount you deposited minus the fee, will be deposited back into a Wallet you created. Then you can send them to where ever you want.Why did you send money obtained from your coins to your own personal savings account without tumbling those coins first?

The two I would look at are Bitcoinfog and Bitblender. They randomly take out a 1 - 3% fee for the service which is well worth it IMO. Your coins will be added to a bunch of  other random coins from other users and tumbled. Then fresh coins, equaling the amount you deposited minus the fee, will be deposited back into a Wallet you created. Then you can send them to where ever you want.  Why did you send money obtained from your coins to your own personal savings account without tumbling those coins first? Please do some reading on tumbling your coins and what  blockchain analysis is.  ","well i always send my btc to a different adress with each withdrawal to my saving's account. however when it come to SENDING my btc, i am pretty clueless. and i dont want to use the same adresses i withdraw to.ill need to use a tumbler? basically this is a service i send the btc to, it takes a fee and then sends the rest using mixed , random adresses? is it?"

If that were true, it wouldn't be possible to send coins directly from bitcoin blender to Evo because Evo changes its deposit address with every transaction; and I've sent coins from bitcoin blender directly to Evo many times. It's probably just that you are just chosing the wrong option when you withdraw from bitcoin blender. I suggest that you go back to bitblender's site and put in a support ticket. Tell him what you're trying to do and he will help you. If something has changed and the option to withdraw to only one address is no longer possible, I'd be surprised.  Good luck.       And for the record, you probably should rethink vending for a while until you get this all figured out.

If you see your method of buying BTC as the major de-anonymizing factor, consider trying to buy BTC with a cash bank beposit, prepaid card type-deals, or in person cash trades. All would make you harder to trace. Also, if you're using a Windows machine, just don't. But overall, the public wifi and burner machine is a good combo.

What I gathered was that if you were to choose 10 ""relays"" (for lack of a better word---your's does just fine, thank you) and you want to tumble 1 bitcoin, it scrambles the coins between wallets 10 times.

I think I got more like 15. So, how does that make sense? Now I'm really confused, and I miss Shared Send even more!  Does anyone know of a service that creates a forwarding address? I met this guy in the forums--bitpro--and his service created a forwarding address, but you had to send your address PGP encrypted. Once it hits the blockchain NOTHING is encrypted, as we know, so I didn't really understand why the added headache.   Please don't suggest bitcoin fog. I've used it many times, and if I had time to wait a week to get my coins from point A to point B every time I need to make a transaction, I'd be sitting in front of the computer constantly.

As from a Vendors perspective the only time we lose out is when the BTC Rate fluctuates dramatically when cashing out.

All of your traffic exits from the same node. You vastly reduce your exit anonymity set size, it might not be usable to trace you but it can certainly be used to vastly improve the chances of linking your connections to different sites together to the same entity.   B. Absolutely no protection from a single entity spying on 100% of your exit traffic. At least when you use a different exit node every ten minutes then a single attacker can't easily spy on 100% of your exit traffic. If you exit via a VPN and it is compromised 100% of your exit traffic can be spied on by one attacker.  C. No ability to access hidden services. Your VPN doesn't know how to be a rendezvous node.  D. Way easy for an attacker to be able to monitor 50% of your connection 100% of the time, which means as soon as you use a Tor entry guard they own you are totally fucked. At least if you enter via a VPN your exit node still changes rapidly making the probability of near 100% correlation go down.  E. It isn't like you wont be traced to your VPN if you exit from it and use it for illegal shit. Now you are vulnerable to the payment being traced to you and your anonymity is reduced to that which you used to pay for the VPN.   F. Not to mention that now there is a single point of compromise that can be used to feed you all kinds of targeted browser and other exploits. If you exit from a VPN and use it for illegal shit it WILL be compromised and now the attacker can view 50% of your circuit for correlation attacks plus they can spy on 100% of your exit traffic plus they can inject attacks to you whenever they want and target them much easier.   VPN -> Tor  Has much fewer downsides. If you trust your VPN at least as much as your ISP you are probably better off doing this than using straight Tor even. Because now you have some level of membership concealment to hide that you use Tor, you have a non-rotating entry guard that could protect you from some internal attacks, etc. The only problem is that if your VPN is malicious they can spy on 100% of your entry traffic which gives them 50% of a correlation attack, but the chances of your VPN spying on random Tor users is much lower than the chances of LE forcing your VPN to spy on you after you exit to an illegal site and they send a court order to the VPN provider.

The idea behind bridges used within Tor is that it is there to hide the fact that you are using Tor and make it look like normal HTTP traffic to your service providers.  So it is obvious that using a public obfs3 bridge is the same as using a shared VPN provider and that you are all trusting way to much in a VPN provider than you should, instead setup a perfectly legal private Tor bridge either on a friends connection, cheap VPS or Amazons free tier service and only share it with those that you trust and you will be safer than using a service like TorVPN or AirVPN.

Better rent a cheap VPS somewhere in iceland or latin america and install your own OpenVPN server.  For 100% security it's wise to work in virtual machine (VirtualBox or VMware) where network adapter does not have internet gateway and any connections there are made thru tor proxy running at host.

There is really no need for a tumbler if you use an offline wallet stored in an external hard drive that can be hidden or destroyed if need be. Just be sure to generate new address for each transaction. Send and receive them in different amounts instead of the total amount each time. If you have some buddies that want to do the same thing and you trust each other just store all your coins in the same external wallet on the external hard drive. The same way any tumblr service works, it simply receives a ton of coins and blends them together and then sends them to you in staggered withdrawl amounts. However their serve can always be reviewed by LE when they drop the hammer on tumblr and money laundering. Why not use a $70 external insurance policy that can be destroyed and losses the tie between you and the coins travels.  Just my .0005",""

These versions typically generate DSS/Elgamal keyswith signing keys with a size of 1024-bits, and an encryption sub-key of as little as 512-bits. 512-bit keys are so unsafe, that they were being broken by hobbyists on spare hardware a dozen years ago. 1024-bit keys were deprecated by NIST more than 3 years ago.Version: BCPG C# v1.6.1.0This version of PGP generates by default a PGP key of 1024-bits, with NO encryption sub-key.

My case is still ongoing, but once this all blows over or I'm out of jail (one of the two   ) I'm going to frame it.  In my case (I can't speak for all search warrants) it was approved in my local magistrates court by a Justice of the Peace. I imagine this is a very simple, routine, almost mechanised operation nowadays.  The reason they raided my house was that a parcel was intercepted, of a quantity that might be a bit difficult to explain as personal, so they broke into my house hoping that they'd find more evidence. But they did a Lisa Stansfield because I have a spotlessly clean house where the strongest drug they'd find is real coffee. My case has stalled, and I suspect they're waiting for me to fuck up again. I might sound calm now but it's fucking scary, no matter how clued-up and informed you think you are.  Violet  ",""

The other reason is that even if it doesn't matter  now, SR could be taken over by LE and connect the dots after they control the servers.  It only takes 1 paper trail to unravel before your OPSEC is compromised so it's always best to take protective measures like tumbling your SR coins.  Everybody though TorMail was safe and now it's controlled by the FBI and being used as evidence.  The people that used PGP religiously per OPSEC protocol have little to worry about, but those that were more lax could have a case being built against them.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","The Jigsaw Puzzle","54042","2014-09-18T05:57:38","Has a Single Tor/Public Wifi User Ever Been Caught","Discussion/Security","  Sorry Baraka but unfortunately Ross made several mistakes. To suggest Ross didn't make any ""noob"" mistakes is ludicrous. Ross wasn't tricked into sending those fake IDs to his IRL address with his real pics attached to them. No, Ross made a conscious decision to purchase them from a SR vendor in Canada to enable him to open up various fake accounts such as cashing out Bitcoins, changing the locations of the SR servers, I.S.P account, ID for renting out a room or at some stage, a home / unit,  etc.  A couple of big ones that come to mind are entering his real life Gmail email address , which just happened to contain his real life name, into the Tor Stack Exchange website when looking for a little programming help during his time building SR. He took his email address down and changed it (I think he then used the nym, frosty) within minutes once he realized what he'd done but it was too late by that stage. One of his biggest mistakes that he may regret not doing for many years to come was ensuring that all SR staff used PGP encryption when communicating with each other without exception. LE were able to gather a wealth of knowledge without doing anything other than just reading the plethora of plain text PM's stored on the SR servers, especially those between staff members. These messages contained info. such as BTC deposit addresses sent to DPR from staff members to deposit their ""wages"" into, including the amounts they were paid plus loads of other incriminating documented evidence which LE should never have even known about. Had he made it compulsory for all staff, including himself, to use PGP when PMing each other, LE wouldn't know half the shit they do now. There are other mistakes Ross madeb which contributed to his demise however to be honest, I can't be bothered listing anymore because I'm sick of fucking typing. Ross is a very intelligent man in anyone's language however his field of expertise wasn't Programming or Internet Security, coding, hosting and configuring a Tor hidden service called the infamous Silk Road, a hugely successful and very profitable darknet market selling loads of illegal products right under the nose of LE agencies world wide for years. What he created was sheer genius and revolutionary IMO however, along the way mistakes were made which ultimately resulted in his arrest and that of most of his staff.    @truecrypt29 - Tails does spoof your MAC address by default, which is excellent. Another way to perhaps answer your question could be to look at it another way. The fact that no one has come forward or even mentioned an instance where a bust such as the one you've described may have even occurred says to me that even if someone has been busted in that fashion, it was such a rare event that others have literally forgotten all about it anyway! I think it's fair to say that it doesn't happen very often, if at all. Just a thought.  ","Not to my knowledge and I follow this shit pretty closely. One guy was identified over Tor but only after he was found IRL first by giving away too much info to undercovers over the original SR. Can't remember his name but you should be able to find it pretty easily. LE had to be sure they had the right guy so they tracked his Tor activity and online presence and compared it when he was at home. It was a 100% match.Don't believe even half of what's in the criminal complaint against Ulbricht. He was either busted by NSA (parallel construction in full effect) or was tricked into sending those fake IDs to his IRL address with his real pics attached to them. One or the other. Any noob mistakes he was said to have made are complete bullshit and aren't to be believed. Especially the one about him having an unencrypted wallet with 100K BTC in it or whatever the amount was.

I wonder how TAILS manages to choose a unique address that won't be a duplicate on any given network? Its highly unlikely to match another one but is definitely possible.  Each network interface has its own hardware address. Your ethernet adapter has one. Your wifi adapter has one. If you plug in another wifi adapter into a USB port then it'll also have its own hardware address. Each port on your router has one. Same with your switch if you're using one. Each address is 48 bits long. The first 24 bits is a vendor ID. The last is unique to the interface. Each address is in hexidecimal form.  Ethernet rules the world in terms of local connection. The internet protocol runs on top of ethernet. The internet protocol uses IP addresses and packets for moving information. Ethernet uses hardware addresses and frames for moving information. Packets fit inside frames. This is called encapsulation. Further protocols like TCP and HTTP are encapsulated inside IP/Ethernet.  The protocol that bridges IP and ethernet is called ARP or address resolution protocol. You can use the arp -a command in Windows to check out what IP addresses you're currently communicating with. The IP and MAC (physical address its listed as) will be there for each entry. Since the most basic and underlying (called datalink) form of digital communication operates with hardware addresses there can't be any duplicates under any circumstances. Not likely with more than 280 trillion possible addresses but if something like TAILS is making them up as they go along a duplicate is possible. That would seriously jeopardize your anonymity if it were to happen.",""

I'm just saying that most of the noob mistakes he is said to have made are bullshit. Calculated lies by LE to build a case against him. Some drug LE will do almost anything to get a conviction. Especially when the stakes are high enough. Lie. Cheat. Steal. Sometimes even kill. Believe it.   And you know this how?? Because the government said so in its criminal complaint?      Not in dispute. But the FBI timeline is. They only found his IRL gmail address after determining who he was IRL  first. Enter NSA to put together the historical pieces afterwards. See ""parallel construction"". This is a noob mistake but not one that led to the downfall of SR in any way. Its just another piece of evidence in the case against him. They worked in reverse to find it. This ability is one of the reasons why NSA is so valuable.    Completely 100% right!!! They never had a proper opsec procedure for everyone to follow. I wouldn't call this a noob mistake. I would call it complacency after 2 years of evading the most powerful government in the world. Or just nowhere near enough paranoia. They WILL find you. The guys behind SR eventually came to believe that would never happen. Bad move. Hindsight is 20/20 though. SR's failure has led to much more opsec which is a good thing. Some people will  only communicate encrypted now. Thank God for that.   Agree completely with you again.  But it all comes down to that single act which compromised Ulbricht's IRL identity and led to the downfall of SR: those fake IDs. LE knew when they were coming and where they were going. They weren't randomly found by customs. There are 3  and only 3 possible ways this happened:  a) LE worked on Ross for over a year to build trust with him. They had a full psych workup done on him by the very best people the government had access to. They knew his weaknesses. Preyed on his IRL loneliness. Then eventually got him to place this fake ID order. Still its hard to believe he didn't use a proxy for this kind of activity. Every other kingpin and billionaire does. That's the only way to ensure that the trail ends with the proxy. And not with you.  b) NSA intercepted relevant info to this order and that info was flagged as so important that the package was located and intercepted. LE got lucky and ""stumbled"" on Ulbricht IRL. The least likely scenario but not impossible.  c) the government found out in the weeks before the intercept (probably through NSA) who Ulbricht was and followed him. When he didn't give them enough info to establish probable cause they arranged the bullshit shipment themselves so they could create it. Then they had all they needed to secure the warrants which eventually led to the location of SR's servers.  I still lean towards the first scenario. Every human being is vulnerable to psychological manipulation. I posted a guide to LE's tactics along those lines very recently. No one is immune. If a person is lonely enough they may be more willing to place trust in someone who is undeserving. People need human interaction. Multiple witnesses have come forward to confirm that Ulbricht spent almost every waking hour inside his place. Perfect pickings for the right mindfuck manipulator.","Sorry Baraka but unfortunately Ross made several mistakes.

No, Ross made a conscious decision to purchase them from a SR vendor in Canada to enable him to open up various fake accounts such as cashing out Bitcoins, changing the locations of the SR servers, I.S.P account, ID for renting out a room or at some stage, a home / unit,  etc.  ;A couple of big ones that come to mind are entering his real life Gmail email address , which just happened to contain his real life name, into the Tor Stack Exchange website when looking for a little programming help during his time building SR. He took his email address down and changed it (I think he then used the nym, frosty) within minutes once he realized what he'd done but it was too late by that stage. ;One of his biggest mistakes that he may regret not doing for many years to come was ensuring that all SR staff used PGP encryption when communicating with each other without exception. LE were able to gather a wealth of knowledge without doing anything other than just reading the plethora of plain text PM's stored on the SR servers, especially those between staff members. These messages contained info. such as BTC deposit addresses sent to DPR from staff members to deposit their ""wages"" into, including the amounts they were paid plus loads of other incriminating documented evidence which LE should never have even known about. Had he made it compulsory for all staff, including himself, to use PGP when PMing each other, LE wouldn't know half the shit they do now. ;There are other mistakes Ross madeb which contributed to his demise however to be honest, I can't be bothered listing anymore because I'm sick of fucking typing. Ross is a very intelligent man in anyone's language however his field of expertise wasn't Programming or Internet Security, coding, hosting and configuring a Tor hidden service called the infamous Silk Road, a hugely successful and very profitable darknet market selling loads of illegal products right under the nose of LE agencies world wide for years. What he created was sheer genius and revolutionary IMO however, along the way mistakes were made which ultimately resulted in his arrest and that of most of his staff. "

"Silk Road 2 Forums","BulletToothTony","54042","2014-09-19T14:14:00","Has a Single Tor/Public Wifi User Ever Been Caught","Discussion/Security"," Huh? The mac address is ""in simple terms"" your computers ""finger print"" that is broadcast to the wifi network for identifying purposes. Tails does spoof your mac, meaning it alters the ""finger print"" when you are using it to connect to a wifi network.  I like to think about it like this.   My computer's mac address is its finger print. Every time I log into a wifi network my computer leaves its finger print. I also have a finger print. Every time I open a door I leave my finger print. There are ways to alter your finger print and ways to cover your finger print so it is not left behind. The same holds true for your mac address.  Using tails is much like altering your finger prints in real life. You can use many methods to alter your finger prints but in time they will return to their original state. As long as you continue to use a method to alter your finger print they will not return to the original state. This is a lot like how tails alters your computer mac address. You can however ""cut"" to deep and change your print forever. It now has a new print though, that is still unique to you. So, you have to alter it again. Tails does this continuously for your mac address each time.   I hope this explanation was helpful.  BTT","No. The hardware/mac address is bound to the network interface. You would have to login to the setup for your network (wifi) adapter and change it manually. TAILS is separate from all that. It is an encrypted platform which runs over Tor by default. You'll have to figure out how to change the mac address and verify that it took. You can do that by logging into your router and checking what's connected. You'll see your internal IP and the associated mac address. If the mac is your fake address then you have it right.Quote from: truecrypt29 on September 19, 2014, 05:29:45 amQuote from: 100trials on September 19, 2014, 04:10:51 amI'm surprised people don't talk about MAC addresses more often when it comes to privacy.

So yes the added layers of security are there to cover your ass. You will be as hard to catch as you are hard to find. The amount of effort you put into your hiding spot determines how long you get to hide. The more steps you go through to hide the more steps THEY have to go through to find you.I like that... The more effortyou put into your hiding spot determines how long you get to hide.

You can then buy top ups for cash and you have your own mobile access point that is not watched by a third party administrator! Public wifi opens you up to lots of other issues, you are making a open connection to your device from a network anybody can access, in the right hands this is a easy way to gain access to devices using the same network!"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","UncleFester","51076","2014-09-06T14:40:11","Dread Pirate Sunk By Leaky CAPTCHA","Discussion/Security","Ever since October 2013, when the FBI took down the online black market and drug bazaar known as the Silk Road, privacy activists and security experts have traded conspiracy theories about how the U.S. government managed to discover the geographic location of the Silk Road Web servers. Those systems were supposed to be obscured behind the anonymity service Tor, but as court documents released Friday explain, that wasnât entirely true: Turns out, the login page for the Silk Road employed an anti-abuse CAPTCHA service that pulled content from the open Internet, thus leaking the siteâs true location.  Tor helps users disguise their identity by bouncing their traffic between different Tor servers, and by encrypting that traffic at every hop along the way. The Silk Road, like many sites that host illicit activity, relied on a feature of Tor known as âhidden services.â This feature allows anyone to offer a Web server without revealing the true Internet address to the siteâs users.  That is, if you do it correctly, which involves making sure you arenât mixing content from the regular open Internet into the fabric of a site protected by Tor. But according to federal investigators,  Ross W. Ulbricht â a.k.a. the âDread Pirate Robertsâ and the 30-year-old arrested last year and charged with running the Silk Road â made this exact mistake.  As explained in the Tor how-to, in order for the Internet address of a computer to be fully hidden on Tor, the applications running on the computer must be properly configured for that purpose. Otherwise, the computerâs true Internet address may âleakâ through the traffic sent from the computer.  And this is how the feds say they located the Silk Road servers:      âThe IP address leak we discovered came from the Silk Road user login interface. Upon examining the individual packets of data being sent back from the website, we noticed that the headers of some of the packets reflected a certain IP address not associated with any known Tor node as the source of the packets. This IP address (the âSubject IP Addressâ) was the only non-Tor source IP address reflected in the traffic we examined.â      âThe Subject IP Address caught our attention because, if a hidden service is properly configured to work on Tor, the source IP address of traffic sent from the hidden service should appear as the IP address of a Tor node, as opposed to the true IP address of the hidden service, which Tor is designed to conceal. When I typed the Subject IP Address into an ordinary (non-Tor) web browser, a part of the Silk Road login screen (the CAPTCHA prompt) appeared. Based on my training and experience, this indicated that the Subject IP Address was the IP address of the SR Server, and that it was âleakingâ from the SR Server because the computer code underlying the login interface was not properly configured at the time to work on Tor.â  For many Tor fans and advocates, The Dread Pirate Robertsâ goof will no doubt be labeled a noob mistake â and perhaps it was. But as Iâve said time and again, staying anonymous online is hard work, even for those of us who are relatively experienced at it. Itâs so difficult, in fact, that even hardened cybercrooks eventually slip up in important and often fateful ways (that is, if someone or something was around at the time to keep a record of it).",""

Now my original usb stick had about 16gb on it. and i put a persistent volume on it but i dont recall putting it somewhere in the neighborhood of around 14gb..mainly the rest of what is left after i put tails onto it.  So after i downloaded the iso and pretty much made a whole new tails usb stick on my second one. lets jsut call the one im on tailsB and the one that is fucked tailsA Now i tried to use the tails installer on tailsB to put it back onto tailsB but it said there is not enough disk space. wth it had 16gb how could that be? so i go onto the my computer section on tails desktop and it says there is only 2.44 gb left. so i used the disk utility to essentially try to wipe it clean. did that. and now i need to reformat it. okay cool did that. went back onto my normal computer with windows so i can try to just redo everything on tailsB...the installer download another new iso.the whole 9 it says it needs to be reformatted again but windows cannot complete it. kinda telling me to just fuck off.  So basically if anyone has any ideas of how to either delete the persistent volume on TailsA while im using TailsB im all ears. i tried using the delete persistent volume on applications menu but it comes up with an error. probably because TailsB doesnt have one. but i digress. im currently trying to use the nautilus diskwipe but it isnt making any progress on it after about 30 minutes.   halphalphalp! i know i could always just buy another stick and probably less GB but either way i will want to be able to recover the space on this one for further use.

Still for personal use they are perfect - almost small enough to swallow in the event of an emergency too.  A decent 512 KiloByte/sec (4.1Mb/s) relay will use a good 200MB+ RAM, only modest CPU cycles (perhaps < 2% on a 2ghz core) and next to no disk space. In our experience having HSDir will occasionally cause the number of simultaneous connections to increase by an order of magnitude (often well over 1500) . Although I have noticed that since SR and Atlantis have gone - those intense circuit storms have very much subsided.  Obviously bandwidth is key and the greater your advertised bandwidth, the greater the maximum simultaneous connections will be. Each connection costs a little cpu but very little memory. If you are CPU bound then disabling netfilter (specifically connection tracking) will probably help performance but obviously losing your firewall is far from ideal so better to just up the cpu if this is the case.  Money for increased performance - bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth. You get to the point though where it is better deploying multiple relays rather than trying to build giant ones. ",""

At worst if they suspect organised crime connections (if you have been fronting ounces to multiple people) they may or may not monitor you for a bit.

Nothing new there -- data retention laws are being debated in many countries around the world -- but this [1] was something I did not know:   Wireless providers' current SMS retention policies vary. An internal Justice Department document (PDF)[2] that the ACLU obtained through the Freedom of Information Act shows that, as of 2010, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint did not store the contents of text messages. Verizon did for up to five days, a change from its earlier no-logs-at-all position[3], and Virgin Mobile kept them for 90 days. The carriers generally kept metadata such as the phone numbers associated with the text for 90 days to 18 months; AT&T was an outlier, keeping it for as long as seven years.  An e-mail message from a detective in the Baltimore County Police Department, leaked by Antisec and reproduced in a 2011 Wired article[4], says that Verizon keeps ""text message content on their servers for 3-5 days."" And: ""Sprint stores their text message content going back 12 days and Nextel content for 7 days. AT&T/Cingular do not preserve content at all. Us Cellular: 3-5 days Boost Mobile LLC: 7 days""  That second set of data is from 2009.

As Nightcrawler posted the mobile phone carriers don't keep SMS text records for long.  As for iMessages (they are blue on the iPhone instead of green) the carriers and even Apple don't have access to those as they are end-to-end encrypted.  for future text message communiaction I highly recommend wickr.  The police genearlly need non-stale evidence to do a search on your home but if they really want to get into your home they'll find a way.  Many police departments don't put a lot of effort into busting weed dealers though from what I'm seeing.  Keeping your house clean is smart.  What about your computer?  The one with the iPhone backup.  I recommend TrueCrypting the entire hard drive.  If the police come then ask for consel.  Asking for consel doesn't mean you're guilty it means you're not stupid.  Don't fall for police retoric like the dumbasses you see on Cops (tv program).

Newbie here just looking for some tips/advice.So some friends of mine who were dealing were recently raided and they found probably around an ounce of weed in their room with a scale and like $500 cash. They also took their cell phones for a month.This is where I come in. I would middle man ounces for them on occasion so my texts are in there. I was wondering how much should I worry about getting charged? I am in Iowa btw. My apartment is completely clear so they won't find anything in a raid here. But I was wondering what I should do with the cell phones? My plan was when they come knocking was to gather up everyones phone and hop out the window(not very high up) and just chill out somewhere for a bit til they finish their search and find nothing. Anyway, I was just looking for some advice on how to handle this and was also wondering if there was some kind of program to completely wipe a phone, kind of the opposite of the device LE has to get everything off the phone.Anyways, thanks for any advice"

They can go to your network and have messages as far back as 3 years pulled up. If your name is mentioned, it'll look bad, but still isn't concrete evidence.Clean the house; get an attorney - never tell the attorney the truth, everything you speak about is 'hypothetical' as if you straight up tell them and then in court they are asked they can't lie for you."

The NSA might. The NSA might also keep records of your phone calls. The NSA could also link the sound of your voice on your normal phone to a burner phone. The fact is the NSA doesn't give two shits about some kid selling ounces of weed. The NSA certainly is not going to help out local LE. Contrary to popular belief, every branch of govt does not stay in very high contact with every other branch, often times it takes personally knowing somebody in a certain division or being fairly high up yourself. Drug dealings that aren't major cartel/kingpen level don't usually get much inter-department communication, nor much actual effort from the main department working on them. Ever notice how vendors rarely get caught unless they make some stupid mistake like using a real return address that is linked to them? Cops are lazy. It is entirely within the NSA's ability to bust every single vendor out there if they put forth enough effort and violate a ton of privacy laws.  I seriously doubt cops will raid you over an ounce of weed anyways, especially if all they have is possible text records.

Here in Georgia (tough laws on marijuana) I was busted with a couple of ounces and the cops could careless about the whereabouts of the marijuana, he just got a decent bust. Like I said, it depends where you live and I live in a rather small town. Now if your friends got charged with posossesion and distributing there could be a posibility that the phone is just being used for evidence as to who and how they were distributing to. It wasn't large quanitites of weed they were busted with. If they went to jail they probably got out in under a week and will be facing good charges if they were charged with distributing.   As for you: Wipe the iPhone, take it apart and pull the battery (unscrew the phone its easy), and hide it somewhere safe if you don't want to trash it. I doubt they will be looking for you but only using the phone as evidence, on the unlikely hood that they are looking for you, stay low and deny that it was you using any type of phone on any number.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","R160K","958","2013-10-18T20:02:29","Best escrow system for anonymous marketplaces?","Discussion/Security","With so many people losing money when Silk Road went down, should anonymous marketplaces be looking at alternative approaches to escrow? All the available options seem to have some issues:   1. Centralised escrow with coins held on server Positives: -Arbiter can be trusted (assuming marketplace is a reputable one). -Disputes can be resolved even when neither buyer nor seller agree (e.g. they both want 100%, but the arbiter decides it should be 50/50). -Central mixing service can be used. Negatives: -Coins lost if server is busted   2. Centralised pseudo-escrow using bitcoin's built-in feature with coins held locally Positives: -Arbiter can be trusted (assuming marketplace is a reputable one). -Coins are never in the hands of a third party. -Buyer and vendor do not depend on escrow provider if they agree with each other on what should happen with the coins. -Coins are safe if market goes down, though are unusable if buyer and seller can't agree on what to do with them. Negatives: -Buyer and vendor use their own addresses, with no automatic mixing meaning if vendor is lax about anonymity precautions security of both parties could be compromised. -Stalemate if neither buyer nor seller agree with a dispute resolution decision (e.g. they both want 100%, but the arbiter decides it should be 50/50).   3. Decentralised escrow with coins held by third party Positives: -Coins are safe if market goes down. -Disputes can be resolved even when neither buyer nor seller agree (e.g. they both want 100%, but the arbiter decides it should be 50/50). Negatives: -Scope for theft of coins by provider. -Scope for provider colluding with either buyer or seller. -Reliant upon the security precautions of a third party. -Vendors could require buyers to use particular providers they know are likely to side with them in case of a dispute. -Provider could try and gather information from participants. More than likely all they would get was ""username x"" transacted with ""username y"" - but if a dispute is opened, they may get information about when a package was (or wasn't) dispatched, possibly what was in it and the estimated shipping time (possibly even what country from/to).   4. Decentralised pseudo-escrow using bitcoin's built-in feature with coins held locally Positives: -Coins are never in the hands of a third party, so no scope for theft. -Buyer and vendor do not depend on escrow provider if they agree with each other on what should happen with the coins. -Coins are safe if market goes down, though are unusable if buyer and seller can't agree on what to do with them. -Coins are safe if escrow provider goes down, though are unusable if buyer and seller can't agree on what to do with them. Negatives: -Scope for provider colluding with either buyer or seller. -Vendors could require buyers to use particular providers they know are likely to side with them in case of a dispute. -Provider could try and gather information from participants. More than likely all they would get was ""username x"" transacted with ""username y"" - but if a dispute is opened, they may get information about when a package was (or wasn't) dispatched, possibly what was in it and the estimated shipping time (possibly even what country from/to).   What about a fifth option?  5. An alternative system using PGP: -When a buyer submits an order, n pairs of bitcoin addresses are generated (or taken from a list of previously generated but unused addresses) and the bitcoins for the purchase are divided amongst them randomly (perhaps with slightly staggered timing for greater anonymity), with each transaction going to both addresses in a pair such that both addresses must consent to any spending of the coins. Call these pairs of addresses ""Bit"". The server encrypts the private keys of each pair of addresses, ""Bit_Pr"", using server-owned PGP keypair ""S"", to make ""S(Bit_Pr)"". -The buyer is asked to enter a public key (or else one stored on file is used), ""B_Pu"", which is used to encrypt ""S(Bit_Pr)"" to make ""B(S(Bit_Pr))"". -When (if) the vendor agrees to the transaction, they are asked to enter a public key (or else one stored on file is used), ""V_Pu"", which is used to encrypt both ""S(Bit_Pr)"" to make ""V(S(Bit_Pr))"" and ""B(S(Bit_Pr))"" to make ""V(B(S(Bit_Pr)))"". The server then decrypts ""V(B(S(Bit_Pr)))"" to make ""V(B(Bit_Pr))"", which it sends out to both buyer and seller, then deletes. It then deletes the unencrypted ""Bit_Pr"" and the encrypted ""S(Bit_Pr)"", leaving only ""V(S(Bit_Pr))"" and ""B(S(Bit_Pr))"" on the server. -If a buyer finalises, they are asked to decrypt ""B(S(Bit_Pr))"" using their private key, ""B_Pu"", to make ""S(Bit_Pr)"" which the server can either decrypt straight away and pay the coins on to another pre-withdrawal account, or hold onto until the vendor decides to withdraw then pay the coins into the mixing service. If the buyer can't/won't decrypt, then the vendor is asked to decrypt ""V(S(Bit_Pr))"" to make ""S(Bit_Pr)"". -If a dispute resolution is opened, the submitting party is asked to decrypt ""B(S(Bit_Pr))"" or ""V(S(Bit_Pr))"" to make ""S(Bit_Pr))"" (if they are unwilling or unable to decrypt it, the other party is asked). The arbiter now has complete control over where the coins go, even if the disputants can't agree. -If the market goes down, then if the buyer and seller can get in touch with each other they can decrypt ""V(B(Bit_Pr))"" to make ""Bit_Pr"" and they are now in control of the coins. The reason ""Bit_Pr"" is made up of pairs of addresses, both of which need to agree transactions, is so that in the event of a dispute the vendor can decrypt one of each pair before the buyer to make ""B(Bit_Pr1)"" which the buyer then decrypts to get ""Bit_Pr1"", whilst the buyer can decrypt the other of each pair before the vendor to make ""V(Bit_Pr2)"" which the vendor then decrypts to get ""Bit_Pr2"", meaning both buyer and vendor each have 50% control of the money, and both need to agree on any transacting it,  and are able to negotiate a resolution between themselves.  Positives: -Whilst the site is in normal operation, this functions just like #1 above, except for the first two (trivial) negatives listed below. -If the site goes down, then the situation is similar to #2 above AFTER a site failure. -If the site were busted, the coins would not be in the hands of LE (unless either buyer or seller colluded with them). -Arbiter can be trusted (if marketplace is reputable). -Disputes can be resolved even when neither buyer nor seller agree (e.g. they both want 100%, but the arbiter decides it should be 50/50). -Central mixing service can be used for deposits and withdrawals. -Buyer and vendor do not depend on escrow provider if they agree with each other on what should happen with the coins. -Coins are safe if market goes down, though are unusable if buyer and seller can't agree on what to do with them. Negatives (very trivial):  -An order can only be finalised if at least one party both agrees to it and has access to their private key (this is an extremely trivial negative). -A dispute resolution can only be opened if at least one party both agrees to it (agrees to a dispute being opened, the outcome hasn't been decided yet) and has access to their private key. (This would realistically only cause headaches when a buyer wanted to open a resolution but had lost their key, whilst the vendor refused to even entertain the idea of a resolution. Although in that case, the money would not go anywhere so eventually the vendor would have to agree to decrypt it if they wanted their money.) Negatives (less trivial): -Holding the coins for a particular transaction in one or more bitcoin addresses might make it easier to identify individual transactions in the block chain (especially if it involves the unusual step of sending transactions to two addresses - the escrow addresses will be easily identifiable), though there are ways of mitigating this. Either one randomly breaks the transaction up and spreads it across multiple escrow addresses, perhaps slightly staggered so they don't all hit the blockchain at the same time; or else the mixing service itself could create some ""pre-paid"" escrow address pairs each with 0.2BTC or whatever, as well as larger holding accounts like it does at the moment, then if there was a payment for say 3.340015BTC, then the private keys for 16 pre-paid address pairs would be encrypted and distributed as described above, with the excess 0.140015BTC remaining (irrecoverably) in the larger holding account (from which it would still be withdrawable in the same way it is now). If the combined excesses from multiple transactions exceeded 0.2BTC, then the vendor would be given another pre-paid address pair (though this time only encrypted with his private key, or not encrypted at all). Then blockchain activity would be harder to link to individual transactions, and when the site went down, the vendor would be able to recover almost all their funds (losing at most 0.19999999BTC).  NOTE: this idea is only concerning escrow; this particular system would not prevent coins being lost that were not in escrow. However, if the coins were kept in the escrow addresses and the vendor was given ""V(Bit_Pr)"" upon finalisation, then unwithdrawn money in vendor accounts would be recoverable too.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","SirLucy","48320","2014-08-11T04:45:55","Tails USB vs Torified Linux VM on a Windows USB","Discussion/Security","I'm trying to decide which method to go with. I'm not a super genious when it comes to some of the technical stuff about computers, specifically Linux, so I apologize for any misunderstandings. I also want to point out that I'm no re-seller or vendor, I'm just a dude that wants to have a good weekend with some friends. My goal is to stay as anonymous as possible and feel confident if for some reason I ever did get a knock on my door. Below I will explain my understanding of both guides and go from there.   1) Using the "" Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume"" -  silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=27.0  My understanding: The end result is booting into a USB stick that is running Tails. Your data is encrypted and requires a password to access it. Your internet traffic via TOR can still be monitored the same as if it were run on the desktop but since it leaves no trail on your HD because you're basically running a portable encrypted mini computer where all your incriminating data is, you can simply just unplug hide/flush/wipe/destroy the drive itself if shit hits the fan, leaving no data to be sniffed through, such as accounts, passwords, bookmarks and wallet.  My questions: -Is there a way to run a VPN along side this or should I use bridges or obfs3?     I did some searching and I apologize if I'm completely oblivious, but all I found was someone mentioning VirtualBox on a USB running Tails and a VPN and no responses.     This also led me to the ""Torified Linux VM on a Windows USB"" guide.   2) Using the "" Tutorial: Encrypted and Torified Linux Virtual Machine on a Windows USB"" -  silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=185.0  My understanding: The end result is an encrypted USB drive running VirtualBox that sets up a Linux based (Xubuntu) virtual machine, where you then run Tor and have access to a bunch of other ubuntu related features. All this, while still being on your desktop, which then leads me to assume you can run a VPN from the desktop which your VM can utilize for more anonymity. Plus I like the fact that it's always persistent and you can snapshot your drive. I'm not all that familiar with Linux, but the guide does a good job at explaining how to get everything up and running to someone who has barely used the OS.  My questions: -Is running a VPN from my desktop and then utilizing that connection within the USB VM possible? obfs3? -Does this option offer a higher level of security compared to tails?   Is one method more convenient and the other safer, or is one both? I plan on things being stored on a USB since I like the portability and I don't want all that incriminating stuff on my HD.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Trust In Us","48320","2014-08-11T05:12:58","Tails USB vs Torified Linux VM on a Windows USB","Discussion/Security","Ill be brief as I am writing up pages of information for someone. Tails is better imho. It is easier to work with all around first. Second Edward Snowden said when asked about all of the different systems that tails was the best. In fact that is what he uses. The amnesiac part of tails can save your ass, but you really don't have much to worry about as a buyer. Still you are way over protected with tails, so I recommend it. In tails under network connections where you connect to either your Ethernet or wifi, there is a button to configure vpn. It is simple to set up. Also tails has the setting to make it look like you are using the newest system of windows in disguise. Sorry if I didn't answer everything, I am in a rush doing what I am doing, Good Luck, Trust Saying something is better is really opinion so Im sure you want to hear from others as well","I'm trying to decide which method to go with. I'm not a super genious when it comes to some of the technical stuff about computers, specifically Linux, so I apologize for any misunderstandings. I also want to point out that I'm no re-seller or vendor, I'm just a dude that wants to have a good weekend with some friends. My goal is to stay as anonymous as possible and feel confident if for some reason I ever did get a knock on my door. Below I will explain my understanding of both guides and go from there.1) Using the ""Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume"" - silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=27.0My understanding:The end result is booting into a USB stick that is running Tails. Your data is encrypted and requires a password to access it. Your internet traffic via TOR can still be monitored the same as if it were run on the desktop but since it leaves no trail on your HD because you're basically running a portable encrypted mini computer where all your incriminating data is, you can simply just unplug hide/flush/wipe/destroy the drive itself if shit hits the fan, leaving no data to be sniffed through, such as accounts, passwords, bookmarks and wallet.My questions:-Is there a way to run a VPN along side this or should I use bridges or obfs3?   I did some searching and I apologize if I'm completely oblivious, but all I found was someone mentioning VirtualBox on a USB running Tails and a VPN and no responses.   This also led me to the ""Torified Linux VM on a Windows USB"" guide.2) Using the ""Tutorial: Encrypted and Torified Linux Virtual Machine on a Windows USB"" - silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=185.0My understanding:The end result is an encrypted USB drive running VirtualBox that sets up a Linux based (Xubuntu) virtual machine, where you then run Tor and have access to a bunch of other ubuntu related features. All this, while still being on your desktop, which then leads me to assume you can run a VPN from the desktop which your VM can utilize for more anonymity. Plus I like the fact that it's always persistent and you can snapshot your drive. I'm not all that familiar with Linux, but the guide does a good job at explaining how to get everything up and running to someone who has barely used the OS.My questions:-Is running a VPN from my desktop and then utilizing that connection within the USB VM possible? obfs3?-Does this option offer a higher level of security compared to tails?Is one method more convenient and the other safer, or is one both? I plan on things being stored on a USB since I like the portability and I don't want all that incriminating stuff on my HD. It would also be nice to be able to use my desktop at the same time but it's not at all a requirement. At the moment I have one computer, planning on probably snagging a laptop later on, but for now this is what I got. I appreciate any and all replies.-SirLucy"

There are other ano OS whonix is made for VM's, jon do is a live OS tor and proxys there are lots to choose from. Just because Snowden said so doesn't make it true, look how many gaping security holes found since he was in USA.  using a vpn with tails is important, as every single connection is forced through tor your ISP can easily see you're running tails, not that is illigal but its a good start for LE these days.  In my opinion tails is great, easy to use, setup etc but I'll only use as a live OS myself. Shame to run such a secure OS inside windows or iOS for that matter",""

Simple as that. So messaging a vendor can be shown to be conspiracy.  But in the examples you gave for Uk is as follows: 1. Paying a vendor - conspiracy to supply 'x' you have made and paid for an agreement to break the law. 2. The vendor posts your package - they have committed supplying 'x' or at least attempting to supply it. Forgetting point 1 you haven't done anything. 3. When the package is in your letterbox - plausable deniability (not a defence in Uk) but straight up denial is. At this point if the prosecution cannot prove beyond doubt that you know what the delivery is and that you are willfully possessing it - no offence 4. Opening the package and keeping 'x' - possession of 'x' is committed, unless lawful, such as taking it to hand it in to the police etc.  There are obviously many different scenarios but hope this answers your questions",""

If LE can somehow link you to the payment then you would be charged with money laundering.   Yes. The vendor can be nailed for distributing controlled substances. Again LE needs enough evidence to secure a conviction.   No. This is NOT a crime. That's because you haven't taken possession of it yet.   Maybe. If LE can prove that you received contraband through the mail and have possession of said contraband then you're dead. The only way they can do that is by having them send a disguised mail carrier to deliver the package to gauge your reaction and have you sign for it. Or a controlled delivery using electronic surveillance gear in the package. So when you open it they're alerted right away. Otherwise the only thing LE can do is ask you directly if you've done anything illegal. Then put pressure on you to spill your guts. So many idiots cave when they pull that shit.  Know your rights and how to exercise them. I've said it countless times. And read ""How to Legally Accept a Drug Package as per Police and Prosecutors"" under Shipping.  Edit: I'll add that the average American citizen commits 3 felonies a day. That's right. AVERAGE CITIZEN. In other words people who are seen as ""law abiding citizens"".

Just like when you arrange a transaction on the street and an undercover cop is there. When you hand him the money thats when they swoop in. You dont technically need to actually recieve anything. As long is it was your intent. This happened to a friend of mine years back. Once they post your package then you are breaking another set of laws specifically if you are in the united states or sending over countrys. Once a boarder of a state or country is crossed, you have just trafficked drugs. If its within a country it isnt as bad, but stil another set of laws broken. When the package is in your letter box does not matter. I can send anything to anyone. If I send a kilo of blow someone and call the police on them will they go to jail? Of coarse not. They need to prove you accepted the package. Once you have opened the pack you have accepted it and claimed ""possesion"" of it.  Whats great about tor is they are unable to prove the pack is yours. Anyone else could be using your address as a drop.

With that in mind, I think the most dangerous period is actually receiving your package (never ever ever sign for one). This can be easily circumvented, however. When you get your package, just write ""RETURN TO SENDER"" on the outside and leave it on your desk/counter/whatever for a day or two.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","1830","2013-11-01T22:44:08","How Risky is Clearnet?","Discussion/Security","IMHO, It's not unacceptably risky, using a clean browser that you don't also use for non-Tor clearnet stuff.  Off the top of my head, here are a few things malicious exit nodes can do: 1. Return the wrong response to DNS queries, so when you go to 'www.somesite.com', you're going to *their* phishing version of that site.  2. Inject any evil HTML/JavaScript/Java/etc into the responses you're getting from any HTTP (not HTTPS website).  Basically, run any web-based exploit on earth on your browser, and you'll think it comes from the destination site.  3. Use 'sslstrip' or the like to try to trick your browser into reconnecting via unencrypted HTTP instead of encrypted HTTPS, then do #2 above.  Your browser will show the URL as ""http:"", instead of ""https:"" but they'll load a picture of a lock icon to make it *look* like it's an SSL connection. 4. Act in conjunction with a compromised or monitored entry guard that you're using to deanonymize you.  So they could theoretically tie your real source IP to the clearnet site you're using.   This doesn't necessarily mean that they could later tie your source IP to .onion addressed hidden services you're using, however.  Just to the clearnet sites you visit through that specific exit node while you're sending via the compromised entry guard/bridge.  They have to own/monitor your first Tor hop to do this.  #2 is the really important one to remember.  It's tempting to turn on Javascript via Noscript for sites you 'trust' (i.e. 'cnn.com probably isn't going to ship me malware'), but it's not just the destination site you're worrying about using clearnet over Tor.  It's a malicious exit node.  If you're connected to the real site via HTTPS, and you're comfortable you haven't been sslstrip'd, Javascript should be as safe as it is ordinarily.  For that site only.   Every other site you have to enable JS for brings the same problem.  This includes components on the webpage of the clearnet site, since damned near all of them are loading shit from fifty sites on the Internet.  Use noscript to keep Javascript off.  HTTPS Everywhere helps give you a fighting chance of noticing an sslstrip attack.  Any unencrypted protocol involving authentication, like POP3 (port 110) or IMAP (port 443) (w/o SSL) is just plain retarded to use through an exit node.  If there's SSL, and it's working (i.e. no sslstrip), the exit is blind to the content.    And always remember.  Unlike non-Tor clearnet surfing, every time you decide whether to trust a site that's not HTTPS, you're having to trust your exit node, too.  I'm not saying there aren't risks, there damned sure are.  But there are risks to NOT using Tor, too.. it's one of those decisions you have to make.  But it's not some crazy risk to take for most people.  Hope this helps a little bit.. ",""

I went looking for a copy when it got mentioned.. I discovered Tor after the OVDB days, so I missed out on most of that..  Would personally like to read it just to see if there are any tips or concepts that didn't get rehashed at the old forum, but haven't found a copy.  Wouldn't mind seeing it for historical reasons if nothing else.  You occasionally find gems of wisdom in even dated documents.  So if somebody has a copy somewhere that they can get clean enough to feel comfortable sending, I'd still like to see it.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","snowwhite421","21058","2014-02-06T01:39:04","Caught with 8g of MDMA MICHIGAN","Discussion/Legal","In regards to the mcl statutes, those are not mandatory minimums. Michigan has sentencing guidlines and the judge has to go by those guidelines, and can not sentence beyond those guidelines without having a very compelling case to support his decision. Even then if he does it opens it up to appeal. You need to contact legal representation, or get work out the requirements to need counsel provided for you if you cannot afford it. A  appointed attorney is not good for trial unless you stay on them and do a lot of work yourself. They would be able to get you a decent deal though. If you qualify for HYTA then an appointed attorney is probably adequate. If you can get hyta, and your counsel doesn't think you can beat it in trial, take the hyta and don't jack off your probation. With the guidelines in Michigan on first offense I'd be surprised if you did any time, but sometimes the county/judge has a lot to do with whether or not you're gonna just get like five years of paper, or if they are gonna hit you with 6mo or 12mo. In Michigan anything beyond 12 months you go to mdoc. Good luck, talk to no one but your counsel and keep your life clean. From now until you discharge or beat your charges is the time to straighten your shit out, and not add to your problems.",""

Yes, he did rob you, but there's a good chance he did in good will to save your ass from getting arrested by avoiding a visual from the other cops. Imagine that situation yourself.

Please give me your thoughts in regards to opsec etc.   My thinking goes like this: There are a lot of passwords to remember if you want to stay secure, and you want every password to be 30+ characters made up of a random set of characters etc. So why not have them all this complex, then keep them in Password Safe with encryption (hell you could put the password safe in an encrypted volume too if you wanted), and that way you only have to remember ONE extremely long password.  Obv. there may be issues regarding the encryption surrounding the Password Safe, and I'm not sure how to get it on to the Tails Persistence volume. But it's a good idea right?",""

For starters, you've mentioned talking over phones and text, your drop is a human who knows you and you're going to be receiving weight in the mail.   Imagine I'm a DEA agent wanting to make a case. I sell quantities on SR to collect addresses. Your stuff shows up at your drop's house. It's under surveillance and his phone, as well as everyone he talks to, is also at this point. Because of this they know what you're up to. Your drop is not going to do 10 years for you in prison, so he squeals on you.   If you read the drug crimes defense book we posted a while ago, you'll notice that the uncorroborated testimony of one person is - in itself, without any other evidence - sufficient to sustain a conviction for a conspiracy case.   It's your life and your risk decision,  but your plan gives me chills and is unsophisticated in my opinion.

Change numbers constantly with burner phones. Buy those shitty $20 chinese phones, buy a sim and load credit on it at a gas station very, very far away from where you live. Change phone numbers at  LEAST every 2 weeks. The more you change, the more expensive it is for them to keep submitting court papers for approval of a phone-tap on a new number.  2. Carry only as much as you're going to sell. Never carry too much, if a person requests a higher quantity of the said substances, split the transaction up into 3 transactions on the same day. Say, someone wants a quarter of coke, split it up into 3/4 different transactions, delivery a percentage of it in the morning, some midday, rest in the afternoon. This gives you plausable denability that you had just purchased the coke and that you're an addict trying to break free.   3. Carry the product in smell-proof bags in your underwear at all times.   4. If you are caught, deny everything.

That case was in the District of Colorado and it was United States v Fricosu. I talked about it directly above the post you just quoted. (This is now the 3rd time in the thread I've mentioned it actually)  She didn't claim she forgot her password until the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered her to reveal it. And after she claimed she forgot, her husband handed the police a list of possible passwords, one of which worked.  As I said above, because of that, the case never reached the appeals court. But honestly, they made clear that they were not going to block the District Court's order, so I'm not sure how that supports your claim. If you fail to comply with a judge's order, you're getting arrested and fined heavily for contempt, at least until a hearing can be scheduled.

She appealed the District Court judge's order to reveal the password to the 10th Circuit, but they refused to intervene. So that tells you where the 10th Circuit stands.

I come here because I know there are some very bright and creative minds that may think of something that I have not. So if you have any advise or been thru something similar, please share. Thanks family."

It only has to describe how it could have built its case, and persuade a judge to sign an arrest warrant.That is why suspicion is growing that the Silk Road servers were actually quietly hacked, and were exploited to reveal details about their users.Those suspicions won't have been eased by the comments of the director general of the UK's new National Crime Agency, Keith Bristow, who said of the arrest of the four Britons that ""the hidden internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you."";So we're left with uncertainty which might not be answered until the FBI brings its full charges to the courtroom. Did a US agency use an exploit - perhaps even a zero-day one (ie, not previously notified) to hack the Silk Road server, and so gain access to details about who was accessing the server - and then follow the trail back to its alleged owner and users?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Mrs X","42","2013-10-08T23:38:17","Guardian theory: Servers hacked before takedown. Your thoughts?","Discussion/Security","That is why hidden servers that need to stay hidden have the following characteristics:   1) They have no public internet address 2) They have no route directly to the Internet and preferably no default route 3) They can only 'talk' to a TOR bridge or a TOR relay - nothing else, nada 4) They are probably virtualized 5) They are subject to a rigorous OS hardening lockdown and patched (somehow)  That way, even if a local user has root access to the server (and you should assume that a powerful or maybe just lucky attacker will be able to do this), he will ONLY BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET VIA TOR and not reveal in anyway the location of the server.   The only way that could possibly change is if he has another exploit which he can use to break out of the virtual machine and onto the underlying virtualization platform (e.g. ESX, Virtual PC etc). Then there is more of a problem. But again, we hope that the underlying virtualization macihne also has a private IP address and only receives inbound connections through a separate VPN device which is the only thing that would have a real IP address. that VPN would only ever be connected to via TOR except in some extreme emergency in which case the server would need to be burnt afterwards anyway.  There are in fact far stronger and safer ways of deploying hidden services but the principals above apply.  I hope that this server has most if not all of the above.",""

Your thoughts?","Discussion/Security"," Yes it would be possible to do this and it provides for a more secure solution technically, as long as the physical link back to you can be overcome. I personally do like the multiple, independent servers in a hardened box setup though. I seem to remember reading a thread about that somewhere just the other day. Similar construction to high-grade encryption units, with tamper sensors, physical barriers, epoxy resin and things were all discussed.  Regarding never using virtualization though, I think as long as you are virtualizing on your own hardware, it is not such a problem and I have a sneaking suspicion that is what Mrs X was trying to show above. It is still vulnerable to physical attack but at least it is no where near as vulnerable as a VPS.  regards  EP","Never use A virtual machine.DPR did this and it allowed a backup w/o detection.better use compartementalized system.Use powerfull micro boards , witch work independent.only connected true a network cable INSIDE the 1 u case a= board 1b= board 2c= board 3d= board 4all boards have 4x1 gbit NIChttp://www.littlepc.com/product/lpc-480g4-powerful-mini-pc-with-four-4-gigabit-lan-ports/spec Processor Intel Coreâ¢ i7 Processor Mem up to 16 GBThis is perfect for single task cases...so what do you do board A you connect to the real internet. board a has a firewall set up and aloows only connection inward to board BBoard B can only reach outside over tor.

While cash is not perfect, it certainly is better than a credit card linked directly to you instead of a fuzzy surveillance picture inside your local Walgreens.

As for teh TOR getting hacked - the real worry is what machine you're using.  Microsoft/Apple are for sure collecting everything you do (your computer never truly deletes all it's information, you're going to have 'bits' of history backlogged on there.   With all these new services rolling out, cloud, microsoft upload syncing, integrated FB/Skype/Hotmail - you're whole life is not only being stored o nthe machines but also in California/Washington/anywhere else (probs Moscow too  ).  The only real way of being safe, is to go back to the old skool physical transactions.  Being invisible is easier that way.    If you're really worried, create new accounts constantly, change your pgp constantly, don't use your home internet! go somewhere remote, VPN, and then come back.      And to top it all off, individuals who buy one or two packages of something a month, probably aren't going to get targeted.  IT's the vendors that SR has to protect, they're the main target.  As for childporn - I hope they all get caught and have their dicks chopped off!!!

There just isnt all that many that will, but there out there.  Ive been using coinbase for a while, and they make the instant btc verification process a real cunt. With out being a level 2 account you have to wait min. 4 business days to receive the coin to your wallet, after having had it deducted from your account. Also its not anonymous, and if your noid you would have to use coinfog, which is another fee and process in itself.   Ive just began using LBTC yesterday, and i must say i dont see any reason why i would need/want to use any other method from here on out. ",""

I did it tonight to try it out, i wanted to see how it worked since its a system you can buy using a credit card. First off DO NOT do this lol. I had no idea how rediculously high the fees were going to be by the time i was done, i spent 100 dollars and ended up getting about 87 dollars in bitcoins back, GOUGED! Yeah that hurt. Anyways you buy the lindons or whatever theyre called and then you can convert them to bitcoins, then you can export them to a wallet. So i went through all that but apparently on your first time you have to wait 48 hours after you pick Withdraw for it to finalize, i knew this part going in. Has anyone else done this? And how long did it really take to finalize your withdraw? Also about 4 hours after i placed it i got an email from the company that handles the original transaction when you purchase the lindons on your CC ""moneybookers"" saying they want a picture of my photo i.d. and a copy of a bill proving my address... WTF are they high? LOL! So i made shure it was really them and not a phishing scam and it really was them. I did some looking around online and alot of people get this message when they buy currency for video games etc, even established customers get these sometimes, its weird, no clue what sends up the flag for this email to be sent out. It's listed on their website under the policies for anti money laundering, for some reason i sent up a red flag that made me a potential money launderer. Maybe they figured thatd be the only person stupid enough to pay such a gaudy fee on 100 dollars *facepalm*. Anyways obviously i'll never be using them again, i was just wondering if anyone else had ever used this and how long it really took for them to be able to withdraw their bitcoins, at this point i could care less if they cancelled the order completely, infact i'd prefer it that way since the charge on my CC is still just pending.",""

Up 'til now I've been using the Tor Browser Bundle in Windows, and I think it basically forced HTTPS Everywhere.  I've now set myself up a Tails Live USB with Persistent Volume, which was impressively easy.  However, there is one thing that is really bothering me.  Everytime I post any information via an online form (when I submit this post, for example) IceWeasel is giving me a warning message telling me: ""The information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party. Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?""  Is this right?  Is this post I'm sending now using IceWeasel on Tails going out unencrypted?  I get it when I log into the forum and enter my password too.  Even happened when signed on to Sheep to have a look around.  Or does the fact that it's going via Tor to a .onion site mean it's encrypted end-to-end anyway, and IceWeasel is giving me the warning unneccesarily.  If so, very alarming to a noob.    Just to be clear - I'm using a fresh set of identities at the moment with the intention of getting the hang of all the PGP, security, etc. Once I feel like I've got the hang of how this all works, I'll then set up a whole new Tails drive and set of identities for actually using the various Dark Net services, in the hope of avoiding Ross Ulbricht syndrome (i.e. making basic mistakes early on that catch up with you later.)

What Iceweasel doesn't know is that it's actually being submitted as a http: request *over Tor*, to an encrypted hidden service.  Traffic between you and hidden services is always encrytped end-to-end, but Iceweasel has no way of knowing that.   I wish the Tails project would patch Iceweasel to get rid of that warning for .onion addresses, but that's probably more trouble than it's worth from their perspective.  Hidden services aren't why they build Tails.  It's probably why everybody really *uses* Tails, but that's a different discusssion.

However, there is also an option in PGP to encrypt a second copy of the message to your own public key.  This means that now you would also be able to decrypt the message because your private key can unlock the copy that's encrypted with your public key.  It's not a good idea to do it here on the Road though, because that leaves meta-data behind in the message that directly connects you to that message.

From; http://miki.it/articles/papers/#bitiodine  We are in an arms race right now against the people who want to destroy Bitcoin, and this is one attack vector that they will use. Now, more than ever, is the need for technologies such as DarkWallet and ZeroCoin of utmost importance. We can not let the forces of evil destroy the fungibility of Bitcoin.  What is fungibility and why is it important? Read this; http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-fungibility-essential/","BitIodine: Extracting Intelligence from the Bitcoin NetworkMaster thesis work - University of Illinois at Chicago - Politecnico di MilanoBitcoin, the famous peer-to-peer, decentralized electronic currency system, allows users to benefit from pseudonymity, by generating an arbitrary number of aliases (or addresses) to move funds. However, the complete history of all transactions ever performed in the Bitcoin network, called blockchain, is public and replicated on each node. The data contained into the network is difficult to analyze manually, but can yield a high number of relevant information.In this thesis we present a modular framework, BitIodine, which parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are likely to belong to a same user or group of users, classifies such users and labels them, and finally visualizes complex information extracted from the Bitcoin network.BitIodine allows to label users automatically or semi-automatically with information on who they are and what they do, thanks to several web scrapers that incrementally update lists of addresses belonging to known identities, and that connect information from trades recorded in exchanges, thus allowing to trace money entering and exiting the Bitcoin economy. BitIodine also supports manual investigation by finding paths and reverse paths between two addresses or a user and an address.We test BitIodine on several real-world use cases. For instance, we find a connection between the founder of the Silk Road, the famous black market operating in Bitcoin, and an address with a balance exceeding 111,114 BTC, likely belonging to the encrypted Silk Road cold wallet. In another example, we investigate the CryptoLocker ransomware, a malware that encrypts the victim's personal files with strong encryption, asking for a ransom to be paid in order to release the files. Starting by an address posted on a forum by a victim, we accurately quantify the number of ransoms paid and get information about the victims.We will release BitIodine to allow the community of researchers to enhance it, thanks to its modular infrastructure. Our hope is that it can become the skeleton for building more complex frameworks for Bitcoin forensic analysis."

Found a post on the subreddit by user TempOnion:  ""Install OpenVPN on the primary host OS; whether this be Windows, MacOS, or Linux. Connect to your VPN provider on the host OS. Then load up Tails as the guest OS in VirtualBox.  Alternatively, you can try setting up a VPN when you run an actual Tails LiveCD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL DO, IT MIGHT CONNECT TO YOUR VPN THROUGH TOR, WHICH WOULDN'T BE GOOD. You want the opposite. I'm too lazy to test this, but you can test it and just see what your IP is. I don't know what's in the software repositories Tails uses, but you can try following this guide *clearnet* https://www.ipredator.se/guide/openvpn/ubuntu/gnome#intro.   If you decide to use a different provider, the steps are identical except you'll use your chosen provider's certificates. You can use that guide if you use a linux distro for setting up OpenVPN on a host OS also. If you are on Windows and will be using the VirtualBox method, OpenVPN has a client called, ""OpenVPN."" Just search for where to download it and put the certificates in the ""Config"" folder under C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\Config.  Your VPN will be faster than Tor; you will not notice a differerce in speed.  Conceivably, if you were super paranoid, you could set your router up with DD-WRT. Assuming your model of router supports OpenVPN (not all DD-WRT implementations support OpenVPN), you could use that as your first VPN layer. Then, using a different VPN provider, you can set up OpenVPN on your host OS."" *clearnet* http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1l19ww/new_to_tor_a_few_questions_on_vpn_and_tails/  You'll have to subscribe to a vpn to get OV functionality however.

Please don't say ""eat them and see what happens"".Pretty much ALL ''Pfizer Xanax Bars'' are fake unless they come from the USA.  Xanax bars are regulated and only prescribed by psychiatrists in the UK.  In europe excluding the UK they are more likely to be real.  Do not eat the Xanax bars.  Give it a lick and see what it tastes like.  If you know the taste of xanax you will know.  But bars advertised on here are fake.  Placebo's and do not contain any active ingredients.  We sent some bars off for testing and came back with no active substance added.  The vendor also did not add any magnesium sterate to the mix which means its obviously an amature pressing pills.  They are usually brittle and badly pressed.  Most vendors who press like to get as many pressed as possible to get more tablets.  The slower the press the better the form/solidity of the tablet.  So when the press is set to a proper speed the tablet will look perfect.  Xanax bars are usually in tubs if/when prescribed.  Not loose unless the doctor puts them into a sealed unit for you.  Loose tablets tend to be fake anyway.  Imported from the phillopenes and sold on in UK with no active substance.  People who take these bars think they are getting a high but its really a placebo.  You take about 3 real bars and your out for good.  Take 3 bars that are sold on SilkRoad and you will get no results.  We are looking into pressing some tabs that will be loose obviously but we have Alprazolam powder They will be normal pills.  No counterfeits or immitations of any kind.  Just blank tabs because we know we have real Alprazolam.  Look out for some tabs from us in the near future and we will sell them at proper prices as they will contain exact amount as advertised.  Not fake pills -_-"

Civil liberties groups denounced the FBIâs move as âbrazen and potentially dangerousâ. Photograph: Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media  Ed Pilkington in New York  Wednesday 29 October 2014 14.42 EDT      Share on Facebook     Share on Twitter     Share via Email     Share on LinkedIn     Share on Google+  Shares 2,859 Comments 227  The FBI is attempting to persuade an obscure regulatory body in Washington to change its rules of engagement in order to seize significant new powers to hack into and carry out surveillance of computers throughout the US and around the world.  Civil liberties groups warn that the proposed rule change amounts to a power grab by the agency that would ride roughshod over strict limits to searches and seizures laid out under the fourth amendment of the US constitution, as well as violate first amendment privacy rights. They have protested that the FBI is seeking to transform its cyber capabilities with minimal public debate and with no congressional oversight.  The regulatory body to which the Department of Justice has applied to make the rule change, the advisory committee on criminal rules, will meet for the first time on November 5 to discuss the issue. The panel will be addressed by a slew of technology experts and privacy advocates concerned about the possible ramifications were the proposals allowed to go into effect next year.  âThis is a giant step forward for the FBIâs operational capabilities, without any consideration of the policy implications. To be seeking these powers at a time of heightened international concern about US surveillance is an especially brazen and potentially dangerous move,â said Ahmed Ghappour, an expert in computer law at University of California, Hastings college of the law, who will be addressing next weekâs hearing.  The proposed operating changes related to rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure, the terms under which the FBI is allowed to conduct searches under court-approved warrants. Under existing wording, warrants have to be highly focused on specific locations where suspected criminal activity is occurring and approved by judges located in that same district.  But under the proposed amendment, a judge can issue a warrant that would allow the FBI to hack into any computer, no matter where it is located. The change is designed specifically to help federal investigators carry out surveillance on computers that have been âanonymizedâ â that is, their location has been hidden using tools such as Tor. Advertisement  The amendment inserts a clause that would allow a judge to issue warrants to gain âremote accessâ to computers âlocated within or outside that districtâ (emphasis added) in cases in which the âdistrict where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological meansâ. The expanded powers to stray across district boundaries would apply to any criminal investigation, not just to terrorist cases as at present.  Were the amendment to be granted by the regulatory committee, the FBI would have the green light to unleash its capabilities â known as ânetwork investigative techniquesâ â on computers across America and beyond. The techniques involve clandestinely installing malicious software, or malware, onto a computer that in turn allows federal agents effectively to control the machine, downloading all its digital contents, switching its camera or microphone on or off, and even taking over other computers in its network.  âThis is an extremely invasive technique,â said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, who will also be addressing the hearing. âWe are talking here about giving the FBI the green light to hack into any computer in the country or around the world.â  A glimpse into the kinds of operations that could multiply under the new powers was gained this week when Soghoian discovered from documents obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation that in 2007 the FBI had faked an Associated Press story as a ruse to insert malware into the computer of a US-based bomb plot suspect. The revelation prompted angry responses from the AP and from the Seattle Times, whose name was also invoked in the documents, though the FBI said it had not in the end imitated the newspaper.  Civil liberties and privacy groups are particularly alarmed that the FBI is seeking such a huge step up in its capabilities through such an apparently backdoor route. Soghoian said of next weekâs meeting: âThis should not be the first public forum for discussion of an issue of this magnitude.â  Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford center for internet and society, said that âthis is an investigative technique that we havenât seen before and we havenât thrashed out the implications. It absolutely should not be done through a rule change â it has to be fully debated publicly, and Congress must be involved.â  Ghappour has also highlighted the potential fall-out internationally were the amendment to be approved. Under current rules, there are no fourth amendment restrictions to US government surveillance activities in other countries as the US constitution only applies to domestic territory.  However, the US government does accept that it should only carry out clandestine searches abroad where the fourth amendmentâs âbasic requirement of reasonablenessâ applies. In a letter setting out its case for the rule 41 reform, the department of justice states that new warrants issued to authorise FBI hacking into computers whose location was unknown would âsupport the reasonableness of the searchâ.  Ghappour fears that such a statement amounts to âpossibly the broadest expansion of extraterritorial surveillance power since the FBIâs inceptionâ. He told the Guardian that âfor the first time the courts will be asked to issue warrants allowing searches outside the countryâ.  He warned that the diplomatic consequences could be serious, with short-term FBI investigations undermining the long-term international relationship building of the US state department. âIn the age of cyber attacks, this sort of thing can scale up pretty quickly.â  Another insight into the expansive thrust of US government thinking in terms of its cyber ambitions was gleaned recently in the prosecution of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of the billion-dollar drug site the Silk Road. Experts suspect that the FBI hacked into the Silk Road server, that was located in Reykjavik, Iceland, though the agency denies that.  In recent legal argument, US prosecutors claimed that even if they had hacked into the server without a warrant, it would have been justified as âa search of foreign property known to contain criminal evidence, for which a warrant was not necessaryâ.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","1750","2013-10-31T18:22:41","Compelled to Disclose Password","Discussion/Security"," Agreed, 100%.    In the U.S., the various Circuits are split on this issue. Some Circuit Courts have held that forcing someone to divulge a passphrase is contrary to the 5th Amendment. Other Circuits have held that forcing someone to give up a passphrase is akin to forcing them to provide a physical key for a lock. Right now, a great deal depends on which circuit you happen to be tried in.   Eventually the Supreme Court is going to have to rule on this, once and for all. I find that prospect frightening, because only one of the nine Justices on the Supreme Court appear to have any clue with respect to technology. In fact, it's so bad that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court actually writes out his decisions in longhand with a felt-tip pen, on a lined yellow legal pad -- he does not use a computer.  Given the Court's particular ideological bent (conservative) I would hazard a guess that they will eventually rule that the 5th Amendment does not apply to passphrases, and that suspects may be compelled to give them up.

A couple of years back, there was a man from Puerto Rico, who was visiting family in South America. He picked up a few porno DVDs from a flea market while there. On his return, these DVDs were seized-upon by a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer, who believed the model in those videos was underage.   The CBP officer consulted with a pediatrician, who stated that, based on the model's breast size, that she was 13 years old. The man was detained and charged with importation and possession of child pornography.   The man was actually put on trial. His attorney, in a brilliant move, contacted the actress in the videos, Lupe Fuentes. Ms. Fuentes, who dubbed herself as Little Lupe Fuentes, was 19 at the time these videos were made and distributed. She actually appeared as a witness at the defendant's trial, where she testified that she was 19 at the time the videos were made. She produced her passport in evidence, as proof of age. Also, during the trial, it turned out that she  was registered as a performer, as required by USC 2257.   The Customs officer and pediatrician based their age determinations upon the work of a British physician, a Dr. Tanner, who produced a scale (the Tanner scale) showing degrees of breast and pubic hair development in the process of normal development. Dr. Tanner later wrote to the journal Pediatrics, where he decried the misuse of the scale that he developed -- he stated that it was  never intended to determine chronological age from the degree of breast and pubic hair development.

I'm only angry at you because a dumb-ass newbie with a poor attitude and an inability to comprehend certain things has now twice accused me of purposely misleading others to gain advantage when nothing could be further from the truth. I've helped anyone who has ever asked for it when I could. What the fuck have you done champ? The main issue here is that you, foopa, are having trouble understanding the differences between the Tails browser, Iceweasel, and the TBB, and the roles they play in each OS.     Again I'll ask you here (since you ignored my question from my last post as seen above), can you detail here and explain just what changes you intend to make, where these changes will be made and what role will they play in improving the security of my Tor browser? I look forward to reading what you have to say because if you don't answer, or can't answer the question, I'll answer it for you and make an example of you to others here of what not to be. Your opinion of me is completely irrelevant and something I couldn't care less about, especially when it comes from such an ignorant, arrogant prick like yourself. Can't wait to read all about these security improvements you speak of for the Tails OS, cause that is what OS you claim to be currently using foopa and posted your delight at fixing a problem you actually created yourself when modifying existing settings -      This below confirms the OS you've used to modify settings on -     Yep, you've mentioned you're using the Live OS, Tails. The anticipation of seeing these security improvements of yours has just grown immensely. I can hardly wait to see what you come up with.............. ","thanks anonymousguy57.I'll tell you this: Mr Jigsaw Puzzle, you sound like a very angry, vindictive person just based off of what you have said.This will be my final post on this subject and I have one more thing to add - NOTHING that I posted in this guide will cause anyone to ""fuck up big time.""Again, leads me to wonder why you would dissuade anyone on these forums from implementing additional security.;  For my own curiosity, what is this ""added security"" you're trying to add to the TBB and exactly what does it entail?  ;  So, I've figured out the problem.  Follow EACH step in the process, EXCEPT this one:network.cookie.cookieBehaviorLeave that as is and you will be able to access both the forums and SR.The only thing I noticed is that I have to set this up every time I turn on Tails, it doesn't save it in the persistent volume no matter what I try.You can thank me later. ;  The only thing I noticed is that I have to set this up every time I turn on Tails, it doesn't save it in the persistent volume no matter what I try.

In the guide it clearly states the following:  ","Now we are going to disable HTTP_Referers because it also is a risk having them enabled. How do referers work? Let's say you are on a website and somebody posts a hyperlink to a picture. If you click on it, the browser will send a request to the server where the picture is, so they can send it back to you and display it in your browser. That request also sends a referer field to that server, telling it where you are coming from, which is the website where the hyperlink was posted. That doesn't sound too bad, but what if that website was private and only your family and closest friends knew about it? Well, not private anymore, since whoever controls the server where that picture is stored, can track you back to where you came from.QuoteI do not wish to have anyone knowing what websites I am visiting, regardless if on the darknet or not.  It is most likely inevitable to access a clearnet image at some point and I value my privacy.  I guess you don't.Again, I wish you the best in your life and sincerely hope you find your way."

Fuck, it that were true, why not develop and use a single Browser for all our needs, regardless of what we got up to?  Geez, thanks for your wonderful insight and for taking the time to explain some important revalations such as informing us all that while Tails and Iceweasel are excellent, secure set-up, (drum roll...................) it's not perfect because by default, Javascript is enabled. WOW penisenvy, you're completely blowing my mind here with this fascinating development none of us knew anything about. Oh please hold my hand Mr penisenvy and explain everything to me again because it's absolutely riveting information and I want to absorb as much as possible from the emotional Tails / Tor / Linux  Genius. we all know you are!  I wonder why Tails uses Iceweasel instead of the TBB for Linux if the parameters set in ""THE GUIDE"" are not just for Tor browsers, but clearnet ones as well. That's interesting penisenvy, that ""THE GUIDE"", a link to a website all about enhancing the security in the TBB, wants you to use the same settings for all your browsers, whether it's a Tor Browser or a Clearnet Browser, is that correct? Why don't we apply the same settings we use in our clearnet browsers and use them in our Tor Browsers too when accessing sites over the hidden web, especially darknet markets and drug forums. Yes, that makes perfect sense to me. The net is the net, isn't that right? A big THANKS goes out to ""THE GUIDE"" for providing such wonderful and innovative security advice which people all over the world should all adopt immediately! (tongue in cheek) . I wouldn't mind some of that popcorn penisenvy? You're right champ, this should be fun now that ""THE GUIDE"" with this awesome security advice is suggesting we can now use Microsoft's Internet Explorer to access the Tor network once I change my settings as per the advice offered by dumb and dumber or AKA, Lloyd and Harry!",""

You have absolutely no concept of what Tails is if you feel the need to make additional changes to the already pre-configured, cut-down and modified version of the Tor browser used by Tails, Iceweasel. For the last time, Iceweasel is NOT the Tor Browser Bundle!! For my own curiosity, what is this ""added security"" you're trying to add to the TBB and exactly what does it entail?   I actually take offence at your suggestion below -    This is the sort of thing that really pisses me off! Who the fuck are you to make such as baseless claim when one just has to look at my post history to know I would never and have never done such a thing. Not only is it completely untrue but you've reached this conclusion because of your own inability to comprehend the difference between the TBB and Iceweasel in Tails. You can't get your head around the fact that one's pre-configured and modified for a reason and the other IS NOT!!  Have you ever considered why the developers just didn't use the TBB in Tails instead of using a modified, cut-down version?? Probably not based on everything you've said thus far.  You really need to pull your head in and understand what your doing before you fuck up big time. Educate yourself and understand what you're preaching to others because people take a very dim view of individuals giving others misleading advice on security related matters. It's all yours mate.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","danjango1","1510","2013-10-27T15:41:02","pine tutorial whonix","Discussion/Security","In this tutorial I shall demonstrate how it is possible to download files from the Tor Network and use them without worrying about possible LE malware concealed from within. Of course you should not be downloading dodgy looking files from mysterious websites, but obviously a LEO operation to spread malware would not be advertising their presence so that it would appear to come from quite legitimate sources e.g. Putting exploits into a PDF press release from the Tor Project or something sneaky like that.  Before you roll your eyes, this is the kind of thing that many governments have tried to do  before, e.g. redirecting people to fake Tor Project websites, that kind of thing. Don't put it past our Western governments to be playing similar tricks, they're not really getting any better at putting restraints on their behavior, just usually more subtle and far better than most one party states at using damage control propaganda when they goof up.  I intend for this tutorial to be used when you want to safely open things like compressed zip files or view PDF files, that is the scope of it so please don't extrapolate too much more beyond that.   -- -- Part 1 :: Some basic questions --   1. What is a VM or Virtual Machine?  The wiki says it is a ""completely isolated guest operating system installation within a normal host operating system"".  In colloquial English, a VM makes your machine temporarily think it's another machine. Your computer is roleplaying! Awesome.  2. Ok, that's weird, but why would I want a sandbox?  You may remember the advice of the good folks of the Tor Project when you have downloaded files from before now, or when you read the instructions on their website.  It went something like this:   Quote      Load external content?      An external application is needed to handle:      http://www.example.com/suspectfile.pdf      NOTE: External applications are NOT Tor safe by default and can unmask you!      If this file is untrusted, you should either save it to view while offline or in a VM, or consider using a transparent Tor Proxy like Tails LiveCD or torsocks.   Remember?! Ok, so this tutorial will show you how to view a file in a VM.   -- -- Part 2 :: Step by step instructions --   1. Download VirtualBox for your machine's Operating System:  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads  2. Obtain an operating system ISO. I strongly suggest using Linux. This tutorial will use a version of Linux called Lubuntu: http://www.lubuntu.net/  3. Exit Tor. Install VirtualBox, go through the installation with all the default options, just click next until it is finished.  4. Run VirtualBox. Up pops a window labelled as ""Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager"". You are good to go.  5. You see a button called 'New'. Clicky.  6. Click Next and;    6.1  Call your VM something e.g. Lubuntu OS or topsecretstuff or whatever.   6.2  Set ""Operating System"" to Linux.   6.3  Set ""Version"" to Ubuntu.   6.4  Click next.  7. The next screen asks how much RAM to allow the VM to use. Just leave it at the default and click next.  8. The next screen asks how much Hard Drive space you want for your VM. Leave at default settings and click next.  9. The next screen asks what file type to use for your new VM 'HD'. Leave at default and... you may be sensing a theme here.  10. Next screen, leave settings at ""Dynamically Allocated"" and click next.  11. Virtual Disk File Location and Size. Leave at defaults, click next.  12. Click ""Create"", and again. Now you're back at the original window. Select your new powered off VM and click 'Start'.  13. The First Run Wizard pops up. Use it to find that the Lubuntu ISO you prepared earlier. Click next and then Start. A 'Summary' dialog box will appear for no reason. Click Start yet again to prove to the machine you are in control. The machine respects a firm handler, if you keep second guessing yourself it'll just crash when it feels like it, mooch around the house all summer, come in late after curfew and even hide your socks so you never find matching pairs. That's just how it is.  14. Suddenly your mouse is captured. It is toying to see how far it can push you around. Press Right Ctrl to liberate your mouse from its clutches. Not because you need to, but because you can. The screen should read ""Language"" and show a list of Languages with English being the default. Click back on the screen, choose your language with the arrow keys and press the Enter key (See! It captured your mouse for no reason at all!)  15. Now you're back at the Lubuntu installation screen. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to select ""Install Lubuntu"" and press Enter.  16. Wait for a moment. A blue screen appears. Wait longer. Sometimes the screen will say technobabble gibberish or change color. The machine now wants to impress you, so things are going as they should be.  17. While the VM is doing its technowizardry, make yourself a nice pot of coffee. Pine recommends using real coffee because although I once could not tell the difference between instant and power coffee, I have come to realize that the fastest way to wish for a premature demise is to suffer the stench of granulated coffee every morning. As such consider using good real coffee as an investment in your future health.  18. Lubuntu will now request a language setting. Click what you want and continue on. Another screen tells you about something called ""best results"". Just leave everything at the default and click continue.  19. The Installation Type screen appears. Keep the default option which is: ""Erase disk and install Lubuntu"" and click continue. Don't worry, it isn't referring to your real machine's hard disk to be completely wiped. It is playing with you again! Click Install Now.  20. Sip your coffee while the OS installs. It requests your location. It's tempting to choose Longyearbyen because it sounds so completely made up, but you can choose anything you like as long as it isn't actually your time zone. New York is the default, it's fine to leave it as that for everybody. Continue!  21. Lubuntu now requests a keyboard layout. Marvel at the number of ""Englishes"" and leave at defaults.  22. Lubuntu now requests:    22.1 Your Name. Do not enter your real name or any online handle. Anything else is fine.   22.2 Your Computer wants a name too. Give it a name, but not your machine's real name.   22.3 Your password. Choose anything, but not any password you use elsewhere. Click continue.  23. Wait while the OS continues to install. If you are a geek, feel overwhelming relief when you realize Lubuntu doesn't use Unity.  24. At long last it is finished and you click ""Restart Now"". If you get a blank screen or nothing happens, hammer on the Enter key a few times.  25. After restart, up come the login screen. Login. Might be slow the first time.   -- -- Part 3 :: Setting up a Folder Share --   1. Logout of the VM. Logout is located in the bottom left menu button just as with standard windows operating systems.  2. Create a special folder on your real machine. Ideally this should be on an encrypted memory stick or similar. This folder is not to be used for anything except passing files to your Virtual Machine, so don't use it for anything else and put it somewhere out of the way.   3. Go back to the ""Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager"" control panel and select ""Shared Folders"". Select ""Add Shared Folder"" (small icon with a '+' in the top right). Set the Folder Path to your special shared folder (should be a 'machine folder'). Tick ""Read Only"" and ""Automount"".  4. Power on your VM again. After login, click on the ""Devices"" menu at the top of the the VM. Then at the bottom of the menu is a option called ""Install Guest Additions"". Click on that. A dialog box will pop up saying ""Removable medium is inserted"". That's fine, click Ok.  5. A folder should appear. Now follow these command line using instructions (if you are a non terminal using windows user say ""Unto the valley of death, but I fear no evil...""):  Open the command line (it is called LXTerminal and it lives inside the little blue 'Start' button at the bottom left. Click that and then choose Accessories and then LXTerminal).  First you need to get some software that hasn't been installed by default:  Type this in:  sudo apt-get install build-essential  // type in your password upon being prompted for it (you won't see the keys being typed appearing on the screen). // Follow any instructions. Select Y for yes when prompted. Wait until the install is finished.   Type this in:  cd /media/VBOXADDITIONS_4.1.20_80170  We are unlikely to all have the same version of VBOX Additions over time, so if you just type in cd /media/VBOXADDITIONS and then press your Tab key the terminal will fill in the appropriate directory for you.  // Now you are in the correct directory  Type this in to make sure:  ls  // You should now see a list of files on the screen. One of them is called VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  -- UPDATE: blurbleep says VBoxLinuxAdditions.run may be hiding out elsewhere!   Quote from: blurbleep on December 13, 2012, 06:26 pm      I believe that one change needs to be made to the tutorial. On my machine when looking for the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run it wasn't found in /media/VBOXADDITIONSVERSION, but instead /media/USERNAME/VBOXADDITIONSVERSION.  --  Type this in:  sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  // A message will appear ""[sudo] password for YourUserAccountName:""  Type in your password that you use to login to Lubuntu. You won't see the characters appearing on the screen when you do this. This is normal. Enter the password correctly and press Enter.  // You should know see a bunch of stuff happening on the terminal. Wait until it finishes.  Type in: exit  // Final command line/terminal note. If you get stuck, carefully repeat your steps.  Now reboot the Virtual Machine.  6. Login and click the little blue 'Start' Button again. Go to System Tools -> Users and Groups.  7. Select ""Manage Groups"" and in Group Settings scroll down until you find ""vboxsf"". When you find this, click on it and select Properties. Tick your username in the Group Members box and enter your password to confirm this.  8. Open the file manager. This is either the picture of a folder next to the blue 'start' button, or else it is in Accessories.  9. Back in the real machine, put a experimental PDF file into your shared folder on the encrypted memory stick or wherever you have it.  10. Go back to the file manager in the virtual machine and navigate to /media/sf_shared. You should see your test PDF file     -- -- Part 4 :: Battening down the hatches --   We are not yet finished. For this tutorial to have a point the Network Connection has to die and we should change the kind of permissions we have currently.  1. Turn off the VM machine and go back to the VirtualBox Manager window. Select ""Network"" for your VM. Deselect the tick mark on ""Enable Network Adapter"".  Double check that it reads ""disabled"" in italics under the ""Network"" link in the VirtualBox manager.  2. Start up the VM. Login and then go to ""System Settings"" -> ""Users and Groups"". Set your account's type to ""Desktop User"".  Now go to ""Advanced Settings"" and look at the ""User Privileges"" tab.  ""Connect to wireless and ethernet networks"" and ""Share files with the local network"" should already be unticked.  Untick these other options too:  [ ]  Connect to Internet using a modem. [ ]  Send and receive faxes. [ ]  Use modems.  Why are we taking away functionality from ourselves? Because the philosophy of Linuxâs superior security is that you should only use those powers you need, when you need them, and never otherwise. Strictly speaking my last instruction just above is almost certainly redundant, but pine is a cautious platypus and so should you be too.   3. Maybe getting to the shared folder is annoying you.  For ease of getting to the shared folder, open up the terminal and type this:  cd ~/Desktop  ln -s /media/sf_shared/ ./shared  Now there ought to be a shortcut on your Lubuntu desktop which takes you directly to the shared folder with a click.   -- -- Part 5 :: Possible Issues --   Q: This seems more complicated than it should be. Is there an easier way? A: Yes. No.  Q: I downloaded the file to the correct folder on my real machine, but I cannot see it in the shared folder on the virtual machine. A: You need to refresh the file explorer. Go to the shared folder in the virtual machine and press Ctrl-R to refresh.  Q: I have an error that says there's a problem mounting/unmounting the Guest Additions CD thingy. A: There are two ways. The fastest is to turn the VM off, and then turn it on again.  Q: I only have granulated coffee, can I continue the tutorial? A: You can, but have you considered the long term implications?   Q: The VM seems awfully sluggish and slow. A: If this a persistent issue over a couple of boots, you need to give the VM more RAM to use. Don't give it much more than half of your physical RAM otherwise your real machine will start becoming the slow one. Turn off the VM and change the RAM setting in the VirtualBox Manager. Also while you're not using your VM you can always pause it to converse resources for your real machine.  Q: You don't need to use apt-get install build-essential, you could just request the gcc directly. A: True. But there can be complications with dependencies and I don't care. This works and is straight forward.  Q: Why don't characters appear on the screen when I type my password? A: If you're sure you've clicked on the VM window, then it is that the terminal doesn't ""echo"" typed characters for a password. This is a security feature that prevents a shoulder snooper from seeing the length of a password. Yes, *unix people are more paranoid by default.  Q: There's something wrong/inefficient with the tutorial! A: Very likely! Tell us what it is then.  Q: I have a issue that isn't addressed here. A: Speak up on the thread, maybe we can help     -- -- Part 6 :: Important Notes --  In this example I use a lightweight Linux operating system (Linux comes in many different forms/packages called distributions or just distros) called Lubuntu. I chose this particular one for two characteristics:  1. It is free and I won't have to register a OS license like you would with Mac/Windows. 2. It is a very fast OS. We don't need nine zillion features, we just need a responsive environment with which to read files.   -> You put files into the shared folder. Then you read them from the virtual machine. Don't get confused!  -> Do not move files from the VM to the real machine. If there is malware it could infect one of those files you move back into your real machine.  -> Make sure that shared folders are read only.  -> Any files that go into a shared folder should be considered infected by malware. Why?  The shared folder at the real machine's end should be thought of as a black hole. Information goes in. Information does not come out. The reason for this is simple: if malware in a VM manages to infect a file in the shared folder then the malware will be triggered when you execute/view that file from the real machine. Files you put into the shared folder become untouchable the moment they are placed inside it + the VM is switched on.   Finally; some last words.   Ideally you should be doing validation on files you download, double checking MD5, SHA hashes, verifying PGP signatures etc so that you're sure you've downloaded the thing the website owners intended you to receive. However there's two fairly basic problems with that kind of approach:  1. 80% or so of the people on here probably have never checked or even heard of a SHA hash, let alone understand how they work. I mean this is ok. We cannot seriously expect everybody to take COMP101 or its equivalent, in the same way that we can't expect everybody to take ECON101 in order to use Bitcoin. Using PGP is a must have, other things less so.  2. Although there are clever ways of compromising your machine (e.g. the redirection to a fake Tor website by screwing around with DNS [this is why you should only download Tor, through Tor itself since Tor can't be fooled by this as it doesn't even use DNS...]), there is the much more basic problem of LE agents forcing the website owners to do a switcharoo with their modified version of the software.  Creating and using a sandbox in the manner I describe is proof against all those scenarios. You don't need to verify a hash (indeed, the majority of files you download don't have them anyway) and it does not matter if you do actually download malware.  This is not a panacea, it is not as secure as having a dedicated machine* exclusively for reading files from the Internet but it is a 'one time investment' and it will produce more practical security for nearly everybody because it is infinitely better than downloading files via Tor and hoping your virus scanner catches any malware before you open/view those files.   * It would receive them via read only CD/DVD, have no physical net connection, this is called an ""Air Gap"" i.e. what the Iranians were supposed to be maintaining until Stuxnet got around it). This is going a bit too far for most of us! Kmfkewn said he might make a SELinux (secure enhanced Linux) tutorial. We could use that to bring this tutorial to the next level (called 'hardening' in security jargon) just slightly below utilizing an Air Gap because SELinux was invented by the NSA itself.

The first question to ask yourself is - why would they come and search my house? - if you only ever have small personal amounts then it is highly unlikely that you would be on anyones radar. If you are holding larger amounts/selling then of course its a different story. Dont store large amounts in your home - find a stash point locally.  Would they use sniffer dogs?  -  depends on what drug and quantity they are looking for - definatly yes for large amounts.  Do they check everything - i.e. Every book, cupboard and potential stash hole? - a search warrant will entitle them to search the complete property - so technicaly they can search werever they want within the boundaries of the property - remember the human element.  If you live in a big house - would they check every room? - the first thing they would do is search every room in the property to find any people within.  Are they likely to find small amounts hidden away? - that would really depend in the hiding place, the more inventive the less chance.  Would they search the garden and out-buildings such as sheds? yes.  Is it best to store stuff up high or down low (if dogs are involved high up may be best?) It would not make any difference, dogs follow scent trails and as such can work there way step by step to the main stash, although if you search the clearnet you will find various opinions on what can confuse a sniffer dogs sniffing:-)  personal amounts id just keep somewere that you can access easily and ditch should the wolves come a knocking.  peace",""

This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt.Gox was the result of one companyâs abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry. There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. These companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age. In order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds. As part of the effort to re-assure customers, the following exchanges will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, Circle, and BTC China. We strongly believe in transparent, thoughtful, and comprehensive consumer protection measures. We pledge to lead the way. Bitcoin operators, whether they be exchanges, wallet services or payment providers, play a critical custodial role over the bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers.

So basically, here's the problem as I understand it: SSD drives are really big on caching and performance.  Basically that's their one advantage over classic hard drives: performance.  They cost more and they hold less, but since they're substantially faster people like them.  The thing is that they're so much faster because they're basically batter-backed RAM sticks (I'm half joking, but they really kind of are like that).  They need the battery because without it, just like the RAM in the rest of your computer (RAM = memory), when you flip the power off the data degrades and is gone almost immediately (this is actually really complicated and it can hang around for minutes sometimes, but that's beside the point).  That isn't true with a classic hard disk.  Those store magnetic bits, and when you delete something what you're doing is marking it as available.  But it's still there on the hard drive for anybody to read.  Over time it slowly gets reused and eventually is totally wiped out.  Things like DBAN don't just let it sit around, they write 0s or random data to every accessible part of the hard drive (usually several times, just to make sure).  But hard drives have little caches that aren't usually accessible from the outside.  They're used to keep data that's accessed frequently in a really fast, readily accessible place so it can be served quickly when it's asked for.  So you see how this can be a serious problem for securely deleting files.  Now presumably a disk wipe utility is going to know about this and be able to deal with it.  Personally I've never tried to write a program that accesses the disk cache itself and have no clue how to do that or how difficult it is... but I'd wager it can be pretty difficult depending on whether a manufacturer actually follows what standards exist for that sort of thing (frequently they don't for one reason or another, and you need a special way to deal with just that company's hard drives, etc., etc.).  Now that's how classic hard drives work.  I know very little about how SSD drives work and have no clue what sort of optimization strategies they employ.  They could entirely defeat encryption or secure deletion for all I know.  That's why I said you should research it or ask somebody who knows already.  Personally I don't, but since I don't know I'm not comfortable saying you're safe because there could be something like a cache going on that's gonna screw you.  So again, in a nutshell... yeah, you're probably safe.  But really I can't tell you that for sure, hopefully somebody else can.  P.S. -- sorry, I get kinda wordy sometimes.  Just ignore it if you aren't interested  ","Nice with many answers so far. I have now installed Win7 through bootcamp and it looked great.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","kok","3104","2013-11-15T20:57:34","Wiping Macbook Pro R clean and only use windows7 - TRUECRYPT","Discussion/Security"," Pretty much the only way to securely wipe an SSD is to use ATA Enhanced Secure Erase, and this requires your SSD to support it which means it needs to have an AES chip and RNG on it in most cases. Most of the newer SSD's seem to have this property though.     There really are battery backed RAM disks but they are called RAM disks not SSD's. SSD is closer to a USB memory stick. RAM disks are orders of magnitude faster than SSD's are orders of magnitude faster than HD's.    Totally incorrect due to your not knowing the difference between a RAM disk and an SSD. Wiping data from a RAM disk is easy, you just remove the battery and it is all gone in a matter of seconds. They are totally different devices.    Yeah some hard drives have SSD built into them for cache and then they take on the security properties of SSD, which are generally worse than HD when it comes to wiping. The worst part about the hybrid drives is that they almost certainly are not going to have AES hardware on them to do an Enhanced Secure Erase of the SSD portion. I would totally avoid hybrid drives just like I would avoid old SSD that don't have support for Enhanced Secure Erase (which is more like ""rekey and erase 256 bits only"", compared to a HD which is ""erase the entire thing""). Lots of hard drives have a RAM cache instead of SSD cache and this is fine since RAM loses state shortly after power is cut.       Wiping an SSD with most disk wipe utilities is going to enormously fuck its performance to the point that it will be essentially unusable until you do a firmware reset of the SSD (Secure Erase or Enhanced Secure Erase, Secure Erase with most SSD doesn't necessarily actually erase it but just resets it, Enhanced Secure Erase doesn't necessarily reset it but does wipe it in the sense that the integrated AES key is erased and a new one is generated. Specifics of these commands vary by the manufacturer though). Actually securely ""wiping"" an SSD absolutely requires using firmware, the firmware can be interacted with either via proprietary tools or open source tools like hdparm. Some regular HD wiping tools that support ATA Secure Erase can probably reset an SSD but unless they support Enhanced Secure Erase they might not be able to wipe it. Also, doing a traditional wipe on an SSD will vastly shorten its lifespan. So make sure you know what you are doing if you try to wipe an SSD. Worst case you will shorten its lifespan significantly, massively fuck its performance up, and not even have actually securely erased everything.     Older and cheaper drives make it essentially impossible to securely erase anything from them. You can still encrypt everything on them, but you can't actually securely erase them with any degree of certainty. That means that if your password for the encryption key is later compromised that even if you reinstalled since the previous installation, previous data could be recovered partially or even to a large extent if the symmetrically encrypted AES key is recovered and your password to decrypt it is discovered. Modern higher end SSD have on board automatic encryption and random number generators, secure erase doesn't actually erase anything other than the encryption key in most cases (probably varies depending on the drive). With a HD you are actually erasing the drive as in overwriting it with new data to make the old data impossible to recover. Secure Erase in the context of SSD is actually just overwriting the integrated AES key that is held in a secure part of the drive that is made to be possible to securely overwrite, and then generating a new key to replace it. The entire purpose of the hardware encryption on SSD is to be able to securely make previous data essentially impossible to recover, it isn't to protect the content of your SSD prior to issuing the Enhanced Secure Erase command. This still isn't quite as good as a HD where you can actually overwrite the data and make it impossible to recover, but in practice it is as good unless you think someone can brute force a 256 bit randomly generated key or break AES-256. It is more secure to secure erase in this way than by encrypting yourself due to the fact that you can actually securely erase the encryption key that the SSD firmware is aware of (whereas the Truecrypt header might still be present on your drive even after you have done several new installs).  But of course you still need to encrypt yourself to protect your data prior to doing an Enhanced Secure Erase, because prior to doing an Enhanced Secure Erase the AES key the SSD is using to encrypt everything is stored in plaintext.

If you completely blow away OS X and just install Windows, you would have to have the Bootcamp Drivers set aside on a USB to load once Windows is installed.   When deleting OS X completely and installing Windows as the only operating system on a Mac, follow these steps regarding two partitions so that Truecrypt Full Disk Encryption will work.     NOTE: I am not familiar with SSD drives, but this is the correct method for FDE when running Windows on a Mac computer with a HDD. Also, I have tested this method running ONLY windows on a Mac computer, but I'm sure there's a way to tweak these steps to make multi-boot possible.    Steps to apply Full Disk Encryption to a Mac computer running Windows: 1. Before you wipe OS X completely, create a bootable Recovery USB (instructions can be found on the apple website). You will need this so you can format and partition your HDD. Also make sure you have the correct Boot Camp drivers downloaded and saved on a separate USB to be used in step 6.  2. Boot to the Recovery USB. Go into Disk Utility and create two partitions. You will need a tiny partition (I think smallest allowed is 1.07GB) so Truecrypt has a place to install their bootloader. Format this partition as MS-DOS(FAT) and go to ""options"" and make sure ""Master Boot Record"" is selected. Format the second, large partition as MS-DOS as well. This partition is the one Windows will be installed on.  3. Remove the recovery usb and insert your Windows install media 4. Restart the computer and hold the option key. Select the Windows installer 5. Follow the Windows install prompts. 6. Once Windows is installed, insert your USB with the Boot Camp Drivers and run the setup.  7. Go to Disk Management (right click on ""computer"" and select ""Manage"". Admin rights are required) 8. Delete the small partition that was created in Step 2 so that it becomes unallocated space 9. Download and install Truecrypt 10. Follow the Truecrypt prompts.  11. Sit back and watch Truecryt do it's thang.      NOTE: During set up, Truecrypt will ask you to create a recovery disk, using an .iso the program creates. If you don't have a blank DVD my suggestion is to simply mount the .iso using a virtual disk program; truecrypt will ""verify"" that the disk was created, and then you can proceed to the final steps.

Also I don't see the point of a VPN.  The only thing I can see it will do is hide the fact that you use Tor from your ISP.   You could do the same thing, and more effectively, with a bridge, could you not?  And for free.  The VPN may SAY it doesn't keep logs, and maybe it doesn't now, but it may in the future.  Or maybe it keeps logs anyhow.  There is no way to know.   Personally I don't know about some offshore VPN company.  I am sure they would take my bitcoin, but not so sure I'd take their word.  ","Never publicly state what VPN you are using.  Makes it easier for LE to narrow down your real IP address."

Just burn tails on a CD/DVD(bootable). At the the startup screen press and hold ALT, then on the screen you have to wait a little until the CD shows. Then you can boot Tails from the CD. Once in tails you can then use an USB stick to create a persistent volume. (Though you have to start Tails 2 times, first to turn your USB in a tails drive and the second time you are able to create a persistent volume)  Once you have configured your USB as  a persistent volume, you can then use Tails normally, but you always have to use the CD, because mac doesn't allow booting from an  USB.  If you want to additionally install electrum on the persistent volume, then you have to install tails 0.19 first. So you have to create 2 CDS, the fist with Tails 0.19, the second with the current version. After you have installed tails 0.19 on your USb and turned it into a persistent volume, you then can upgrade to the new version.  You have to install tails 0.19 fist to be able to use electrum because in 0.19 there is a function called ""custom persistent volume"" which you need to use electrum, but was disabled in the later versions.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","SelfSovereignty","4075","2013-11-22T05:33:42","Printers have data storage too","Discussion/Security","Printers have spools that are designed to accept and queue printing jobs as they're received (much like they queue multiple pages of a single job -- they can't print them all at once after all).  To do that they need to store the data somewhere.  While reading the PlutoPete thread here, I suddenly realized this is something I've never seen pointed out on the forums.  They also can store a great deal these days, I understand.  I believe usually this memory is volatile, meaning the contents of it is lost when power is cut; so unplugging the printer will do the job, but I seriously doubt anything short of physically pulling the plug will actually suffice.  I wouldn't be surprised if expensive ones have some kind of setup that allows the power to go out during a print job without losing the document too (meaning their memory could be non-volatile, as it's gotten awfully cheap these days).  That would be very undesirable for us, though I'm not a vendor and don't really know how most of them print out their orders.  In the case of PlutoPete, who I'm sure was printing out the addresses of vendors ordering MBBs using some method other than pen-and-paper, this could be a truly catastrophic bit of bad luck for some.  There is no full-disk encryption or the like in your average printer, nor really any good way of accomplishing this via software.  They aren't designed to hide or erase data.  They're designed to print stuff and to be cheap to manufacture.  I felt it worth mentioning, since I can't recall ever seeing it explicitly stated before.  If you're the sort of vendor that I'd shake the hand of and sincerely thank in person for deliberately tossing customer addresses, try to remember it's a concern that exists on top of the computer you're using.  Pull the plug after you deal with your computer during your enormous free time when raided by a SWAT team, or something    I know all vendors are supposed to do that, but c'mon.  Let's be realistic: I'm sure most keep them.  Ironically though the reality is that all they're doing is keeping well organized records of their vast sales of illegal substances that will most definitely be used against them in court (and possibly influence their sentencing too even if they plead guilty).",""

There are lots of good posts around here on encryption and using it with Tails.  Personally I'd trust Nightcrawler, Astor, and kmfkewm with my freedom.  In fact I actually do, given that I take most anything those three say as having come from the lips of the Oracle itself.  Oh, and no, I have no clue which Oracle it is that I'm actually referring to.  Take the ones that know the answers to even intractable questions and provide them on demand in theoretical computer science, toss them all in a hat, and snatch one those suckers out of it; any number of them will do, I'm sure.  ... Ya know, maybe I should work on making my jokes less, mm... esoteric?      As for how far back they can go, I really have no justification for giving you a concrete number.  Since I'm sure you want one anyway though... let's say a month.  Sure, why not a month.  I mean it sounds reasonable enough, doesn't it?  In fact it's so reasonable it might actually be right too!     Frankly I have no idea how a label maker is engineered, but it depends entirely on how much memory is on the device and how much of that memory gets taken up for each address printed -- neither of which I have anything but wild guesses regarding, hence the very reasonable sounding and possibly recklessly inaccurate statement of a month.","Operating systems also have a print spool.  Know where it is and delete with data wiping software.  For Linux there's a wiping program named Bleachbit.  There's also wiping software for Windows, but I don't recommend even using Windows.  I'm not sure if the privacy versions of Linux like Tails have this problem.  I'll likely go to Tails.  For those of you using it, do you know if Tails has a print spool that needs to be Bleachbitted?

For ink Jet, tape over the label to be sure it does not get wet and made unreadable.  This thread is really about the memory in the printer though. I have worried about it before, but would +1 the OP for making a thread about it as I have not seen it discussed before. Very smart idea unplugging the printer if under attack. Maybe put it and other such memory devices on a ""plug in strip"" so one switch kills the power to them all?

As TAILS loads the greeter will again ask you ""More Options?"" - select NO, then wait for TAILS to finish loading.Step 6 - From the menu at the top-left of the desktop screen, go to Applications > Tails > Configure Persistent Volume, This opens the Persistence WizardStep 7 - Enter your Strong Password twice then click ""Create"".Do not forget this password! You (nor anyone else) will EVER recover any saved persistent data without this password!Step 8 - Check the persistence options you want to enable. For now, put green checkmarks â next to the first two items only - Personal Data and GnuPG.Step 9 - Reboot from the USB one last time. Now when the greeter presents you with ""More Optons"" (check NO as always) it also asks ""Enable Persistence?"" - check YES and enter the password.Now you can save files by storing them in the ""Persistence"" folder and also your pgp keys are not all lost at the end of every session"

The reward puts the small company in the same league as Google, Facebook and Microsoft, all of which offer substantial payouts to security researchers for finding dangerous bugs that could compromise their users' data.  Wickr has already closely vetted its application so the challenge could be tough. Veracode, an application security testing company, and Stroz Friedberg, a computer forensics firm, have reviewed the software, in addition to independent security researchers.  In a statement, Wickr said ""we expect finding critical vulnerabilities in Wickr to be difficult and are honored to work with those that do.""  Companies benefit from these bug bounty programs because they create an incentive for a large number of engineers with various types and levels of expertise to test their applications. It can be a better investment than hiring full-time staff, according to one study.  Wickr said vulnerabilities that substantially affect the confidentiality or integrity of user data could qualify for the maximum reward. Less severe bugs could garner a researcher $10,000 or more. Researchers are required not to publicize their discoveries for three months without written permission, giving Wickr time to review and fix potential issues. Bug information should be sent to bugbounty@mywickr.com.  Messages sent through Wickr are encrypted on the mobile device. Although the scrambled data passes through Wickr's servers, Wickr does not have a key to decrypt the content. A message can be tagged with an expiry date that causes it to be erased on the recipient's phone after a specific time.  Wickr, based in San Francisco, promotes its application, which runs on iOS and Android, as a safe way to send messages, photos, files and video. Since it does not retain data on its servers, the company maintains it would be unable to turn over users' data to law enforcement.""    ",""

First, they charged a flat fee of 1.5% (which I believe was reduced to 0.5%), and when you sent the coins to your anonymous address, the fee would be subtracted, and the rest would be deposited to your real bitcoin address in exactly two transactions, within about 10 minutes. So if someone identifies your SR address as belonging to SR and they see the deposit came from another address, which they suspect belongs to blockchain.info, because the coins in that address came from two transactions a few minutes apart, then they merely have to look in the block chain for a transaction that occurred about 10 minutes earlier and involved exactly 1.5% (or 0.5%) more BTC. Now they are on the other side of the mixer and they can follow the transaction chain back to the exchange and your identity.There are much better mixing services that give you more options for how you deposit and withdraw your coins, along with charging variable rate fees, to defend against that kind of traffic analysis."

Install. Now, navigate to where ever you installed it to, and open ""start I2P (restartable)"" Command prompt should come up, do some computer stuff, and then it should open ***Your default internet browser***  I2P is now started on your computer. You can close out all of your browsers, and that will not turn off I2P. You have to exit I2P from the toolbar. This is good, so you don't accidentally turn off your session of I2P. For some reason, my I2P wants to starts in IE. Here is my recommendation. Have one browser used only for I2P. So if you mainly use chrome, don't use chrome for I2P. the reason for this, is because I2P starts up slow. You have to let it collect information before you can move around in the I2P world. You want to be able to surf the normal internet on chrome, while I2P boots up on IE.  Okay, so you started the I2P program, it did it's thing, and it popped up a internet browser window with a purple background and words. If you don't want to use the browser it popped up, copy the address from the URL bar, open whatever browser you want, and paste it in. That simple.  Step 2: Ready for the ""hard"" part?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","sphinox","5066","2013-12-02T05:41:51","Hey everyone, lets learn to I2P before it goes mainstream and uncool.","Discussion/Security","I2P has definitely not been researched enough to be used for anything sensitive IMO. It also has inherent weaknesses for vendors, primarily the fact that enumeration of clients is trivial. Most I2P nodes route traffic for other I2P nodes, generally speaking it is not hard to enumerate the IP addresses of most clients using I2P. For most people this isn't an issue, but for vendors it is an issue due to the fact that they leak their rough geographic location when shipping product. If a vendor sends a package with a return address from a small rural city and the feds determine that the vendor is someone in that city or the surrounding area, they already have an anonymity set size for the vendor that is equal to every person in the geographic region around where the vendor shipped from. They also know that the vendor is someone using I2P if the vendor talks to them over the I2P network. The crowd size of people who live in any given small rural city who use I2P is going to be very small, it will probably consist of one person. Even in many large cities the number is going to be so small that it wouldn't cost much to put all potential targets under surveillance. Since the list of IP addresses of users of I2P is not hard to enumerate, this attack is not hard to carry out. I2P does allow for clients to configure themselves so that they do not route traffic for other nodes, the anonymity hit this brings with it has not been fully researched but it is thought to be significant. It certainly could increase vulnerability to internal correlation attacks, possibly negating one of the primary anonymity advantages of I2P. Also, if only vendors are operating in this mode then someone finding a client operating in this mode could guess with high probability that the detected client is a vendor.   Tor offers protection from this attack in many ways. Primarily, Tor has entry guards that clients always connect to as their first nodes. Entry guards are only rotated every few months by the client, limiting the clients exposure to enumeration. Bridges and obfsproxy can add significantly more protection from these attacks. Tor is by virtue of its initial design resistant to attacks like this, and due to the fact that the defenses from censorship also tend to protect from this class of attack Tor has further benefited from the great amount of time the developers have put into protecting from censorship.   Although Tor hidden services are not perfect they are resistant to a variety of quite bad attacks against the I2P network. Frequent downtime of an I2P hidden service can quickly degrade its anonymity set size even in the presence of a fairly weak attacker. I2P hidden services are weak to various intersection attacks that Tor hidden services are largely protected from. There really isn't much of an anonymity benefit to I2P, my opinion of it is that it is a trendy hobbyist network whereas Tor is more of a serious academic project. ",""

It's an encrypted email / messaging system, based on the bitcoin technology. It's peer-to-peer and it's distributed (so no central authority) and messages are both: (1) anonymous (no one knows who you are) and (2) encrypted (no one knows what you've said... except the recipient)  Why is it better than current freely available GPG or OpenPGP systems of public key / private key encryption ? These systems are excellent. But they are highly technical, they require a knowledge of encryption and a knowledge of the software's features to use them properly. In short, not very user friendly for non-technical users. (Like my gran, or my sister).  Bitmessage requires none of this. It hides the all the encryption / digital signing complexities. All you do is create an 'address' (or multiple addresses). Your correspondents send messages to this address and they arrive at your inbox. You, in turn, can send messages to someone else's address and they receive them in their inbox. The encryption and digital signing is done automatically when you press the send button. The msg signature is verified and decrypted when the recipient opens the message. No keyservers. No certification authorities, no 'web of trust', no key-signing, no master keys and sub-keys... no revocation certificates. etc. etc.  It's anonymity and privacy for all... and it's free.  so....   this is why we should use bitmessage.

For this reason i feel that news of the existance of bitmessage should be circulated. People can't choose to access this technology unless they are aware that it exists.  I agree with your view that this is new technology that needs code reviewing, and security auditing. So i have two simple questions for you.  1.  Would you consider offering some of your time to help perfect this application ? 2.  Can you think of others with relevant expertise that might be willing to help assess and critique bitmessage ?  If so you could perhaps contact the author at bitmessage.org (I am personally not associated with this project).  have a nice day .. be happy  :-)  playground  ","Quote from: Sunwu on February 17, 2014, 09:18:20 amcertainly bitmessage is a great idea, I agree -- if it lives up to its billing, it could be a tremendous asset.

I see little reason not to use bitmessage once it is used over TOR (in which case attackers won't even know if you're using bitmessage let alone what messages you're sending/receiving) and run inside a mounted Truecrypt volume. One can use PGP when sending extra sensitive information as well if they want to be extra careful. All messages are deleted after 2 days in any event which is excellent. Even if somebody obtained your PGP key, the chances are a lot of evidence would be destroyed.    Given all the troubles with centralised market places and the fact I'm not getting any responses from anyone in regards to being instated as a vendor on the market site here, I'm seriously considering setting out alone and vending through bitmessage. I could set up a customer feedback thread on the hub to so prospective buyers can monitor my business. "

This private half has to be guarded more closely than your wallet, or your credit card, or your most precious possession. -- it should never leave your custody nor control. This separation of keys and functions is the cornerstone of the system.   The problems with iGolder are as follows:   First, you are using software hosted on a machine that you should not trust. You do not know for certain who the owners/operators are, or what things their server could be doing in the background. The user has no way to know whether the PGP keys were properly generated or not.

Quote from: Sunwu on February 17, 2014, 09:18:20 amwe would like to use Bitmessage + PGP,we never know in the future the NSA could crack the encryption of PGP and then what? if we are using PGP over Gmail, and its recorded forever, until its too late.  I agree that PGP should be used as an underlying crypto layer as well. Bitmessage is less than two years old, and the author has been soliciting for people to security audit his software. Sure PGP keys might be broken in another few decades, but who is really going to care about some deals that were made 25-30 years in the past?  There are very few crimes that would be prosecuted after such a length of time: murder, sexual abuse, child pornography are some offenses that come to mind. Many countries have statutes of limitations which bar prosecutions after a certain period. As I said, it's relatively new. Maybe in 5 years, Bitmessage will be as essential a tool as PGP is today. It needs a lot more time and scrutiny before it is mature. NightcrawlerHi Nightcrawler,   good post. :-)As is perhaps evident, i believe that bitmessage or other applications inspired by it, are strategically important because they hold the promise of granting individuals easy access to privacy and anonymity.For this reason i feel that news of the existance of bitmessage should be circulated.People can't choose to access this technology unless it exists.I agree with your view that this is new technology that needs code reviewing, and security auditing.So i have two simple questions for you.1.  Would you consider offering some of your time to help perfect this application ?2.  Can you think of others with relevant expertise that might be willing to help assess and critique bitmessage ?If so you could perhaps contact the author at bitmessage.org(I am personally not associated with this project).have a nice day .. be happy  :-)playground "

After that time, they approached the FBI for help. The FBI spent another 12 months unsuccessfully attempting to access the data.  So, while TrueCrypt may not have been audited, it has been tested in the real world, and not found wanting.

If you are a researcher capable of reviewing the source code, please email the lead developer. You will be helping to create a great privacy option for people everywhere! How many of the forum users rely or have been relying on truecrypt? That has been touted as the holy grail of HD encryption for ages, yet only recently it has been audited for security. I would claim the author's message is more proof of proper attitude towards security than a proof of the software being not safe. He is inviting more eyes to look into the code, for items he might have missed. Using an encryption is not hard. Implementing it safely/fool proof is hard. I don't consider it propable that the protocol and the transfer of mesages in bitmessage are unsecure/weak. After all, bitcoin technology has been in use for quite long and seems to be quite bulletproof. The possible weaknesses are most likely in the client program and could be expoited by a targeted attack (=specifically crafted malware / confiscation of the equipment,,, etc)"

The best area being Time Square in New York. Then when you are finished switch it off, pull out the battery and put both the phone and battery in a faraday bag or wrap it in aluminum foil several times. To make sure your bag works properly, try calling it (from a pay phone) while it is still on and your phone should not be able to receive calls because the bags/foil block the signals making it to the phone and keep the phone from pinging off the towers.   Once your phone is secure you can then transport it home. Once the battery runs out, throw out the phone since most phones require the battery to be in the phone when charged. If you can charge the battery without being inside the phone, then bag/wrap the phone, and charge it somewhere. The less time that phone is able to ping off a tower, the better.  Of course you now have a phone that will raise red flags, since this is not normal behavior. So only use it in crowded areas for short periods of time.

(Not that there's anything essentially wrong with 3072-bits, it's just that I believe it prudent to generate the maximum size key currently possible with the stock software.)  Software to avoid like the fucking plague:  Any software that uses the Java Bouncycastle crypto libraries. This includes any Java-based software like PortablePGP. You can identify these versions from their version string: Version: BCPG 1.4x or BCPG 1.6 -- this software is not just broken, it's absolutely BRAIN DEAD.   I've seen people use BCPG 1.4x and the default encryption keys are 512-bit!  Keys that small were being broken more than a dozen years ago on spare hardware people had laying about the office. In Schneier's excellent Applied Cryptography, he included a table listing the recommended key sizes to protect against various threats. Even when the book was published, in 1995, the recommended key size for protection against INDIVIDUALS, not corporations or governments, was 768-bits. 512-bits is many, many, orders of magnitude smaller than that.   GPG4USB is good, and highly recommended because of its intuitive user interface. GPGTools is great, if you have a Mac. Another really good one is Gnu Privacy Tray, or GnuPT.  It is put together by a German group, and they track the changes in GPG,a nd update their software quite rapidly. For example, GPG 1.4.15 was released less than a week ago, and the GnuPT folk have already updated their software to 5.1.0.    What the GnuPT folk have done is to create an installer that installs not only the latest version of GPG 1.x, but they also have a neat front end. It places an icon in the Windows system tray, which when you right-click on it, bring up a menu allowing you to perform various operations, such as encrypting/decrypting the clipboard, for example.  This software is highly recommended -- I would be using it myself, if I were a Windows user.

(Not that there's anything essentially wrong with 3072-bits, it's just that I believe it prudent to generate the maximum size key currently possible with the stock software.)Software to avoid like the fucking plague:  Any software that uses the Java Bouncycastle crypto libraries. This includes any Java-based software like PortablePGP. You can identify these versions from their version string: Version: BCPG 1.4x or BCPG 1.6 -- this software is not just broken, it's absolutely BRAIN DEAD. I've seen people use BCPG 1.4x and the default encryption keys are 512-bit!  Keys that small were being broken more than a dozen years ago on spare hardware people had laying about the office. In Schneier's excellent Applied Cryptography, he included a table listing the recommended key sizes to protect against various threats. Even when the book was published, in 1995, the recommended key size for protection against INDIVIDUALS, not corporations or governments, was 768-bits. 512-bits is many, many, orders of magnitude smaller than that. GPG4USB is good, and highly recommended because of its intuitive user interface. GPGTools is great, if you have a Mac. Another really good one is Gnu Privacy Tray, or GnuPT.  It is put together by a German group, and they track the changes in GPG,a nd update their software quite rapidly. For example, GPG 1.4.15 was released less than a week ago, and the GnuPT folk have already updated their software to 5.1.0.  What the GnuPT folk have done is to create an installer that installs not only the latest version of GPG 1.x, but they also have a neat front end. It places an icon in the Windows system tray, which when you right-click on it, bring up a menu allowing you to perform various operations, such as encrypting/decrypting the clipboard, for example.  This software is highly recommended -- I would be using it myself, if I were a Windows user.

To be successful, one must ensure the seller will not have the opportunity to use that information.  Safe drops without connection to your person would be sufficient if you plan on sampling from unknown vendors.

If its WPA/2 then it becomes quite a bit harder and having a nice GPU rig could be helpful unless the password is <5or6 chars. To even start you have to grab a handshake from a legitimate client (deauth attack speeds this up) then its try and crack it, I can't remember specific numbers but a decent CPU will do maybe 20k/s, I think my GPU rig was about 350-400k/s. Hashcat is a good tool for cracking passwords and supports plenty of GPU's. There is a exploit in some routers WPS implementation that makes getting the key easier, i think its 10^4+10^3+10 maximum. I think the easiest software for this technique is called reaver, it can take a while tho as some routers lock you out for XXmins after so many wrong attempts. Hypothetically if I were attempting to crack a target I would identify the type of router (by MAC address or SSID) , see if it is one given away by the ISP (which usually have defaults that rarely get changed) some have calculators available online for the default password but failing that you can sometimes get an idea of the password structure, be it 8 chars all lowercase or 15 chars hexadecimal etc which will allow you to set your cracking software rules appropriately. Its been so long since I cracked any WPA but you do notice patterns with passwords.... and most do get left on default.  The funniest way i got into one once was through a web interface exposed to the internet with a default password, once logged in the WPA key was visible in plaintext lol. ",""

As a leader you are left with making tough choices and decisions. I'm sure they probably get tons of messages from trolls , members about information they have that the feds are closing in. So upon receiving this info you left with a dilemma.  If the message is to be taken seriously, make the public announcement of the message which will create mass panic throughout the community, and after all said and done..Nothing happens? Then what? Go back to business as usual? Sorry man, it doesn't work that way and the name DPR would lose all credibility towards him and that's when things start to fall and everyone here would be saying some thing different. Would you take that risk? That if you're wrong you could lose everything you worked hard to build. People aren't as forgiving as many would think especially in this game.  2. People keep talking about kill switches to be spread out to 2-3 different people. You really don't know what you're talking about. While DPR and everyone has their strong feelings about the cause at the end of the day this is a multi-million dollar business. And if you ever ran your own crew before you would know, never give your soldiers that much power or trust to hold over you. His employees aren't people who are around him in person all the time, this is an anonymous  market where people can be who ever the hell they want to be...and to give a person that much trust and power. That's something you cannot take a chance on especially when there's big money involved. For me, unless this person was a equal partner that kill switch stays in my hands. Of course trust and power needs to be given to the mods and admins but just enough that they will stay loyal and you'll be able to keep it contained if anything were to happen.  3. If kill switches are in play, what makes you think they would make it known to all? Why give the other side any hints or information on how our security and structure is built?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Vicious_Delicious","3812","2013-11-20T13:14:05","Tutorial: Portable Encrypted Whonix on a Windows USB Stick","Discussion/Security","Hey Guys, this tutorial was not written by me, copied from old Sr forums, originally created by Bazille, This tutorial explains step by step how to create an encrypted portable USB stick with Whonix, which you can start directly from Microsoft Windows without rebooting. Don't be put off by having to type stuff in the command line, you will mostly only have to do this during installation.   Completing the tutorial produces a torified Linux installation, similar to Tails. The main advantage over Tails is complete encryption and complete persistence. Furthermore, compared with Tails, Whonix makes it even harder for attackers to find out your real IP address by using root exploits against your browser, because the virtual desktop machine can't connect to the internet even when someone gets admin privileges.  As Whonix is based on good old Debian, you will receive (security) updates directly from the Debian servers, so you won't have to download a new version of Whonix all the time.  For a comparison between Tails and Whonix, have a look at this page: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Comparison_with_Others  Whonix feature list: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Features  Whonix preinstalled software: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Software  Whonix documentation: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Documentation  System requirements: * Microsoft Windows XP or higher (it's possible to run it on Mac and Linux, if you're know what you're doing) * 8GB USB stick or better  Time needed to complete the tutorial: 3+ hours  Don't send me private messages asking for support. Use this thread to ask your questions instead.  CC-BY Bernd Liefert, 15.08.2013     [WARNING] After you've removed the USB stick from the machine, it may be possible to tell that you've used TrueCrypt and VirtualBox by looking at the Windows registry. However it's not possible to tell that Tor was used or what else was run from the USB stick. Putty, VirtualBox and TrueCrypt do not get installed onto your hard drive. [/WARNING]",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Vicious_Delicious","3812","2013-11-20T13:15:50","Tutorial: Portable Encrypted Whonix on a Windows USB Stick","Discussion/Security","5. Tor configuration  The Tor Server is running on the Whonix-Gateway virtual machine, which doesn't support copy + paste. To make the configuration of Tor easier, we have to use a SSH client on the Windows desktop.  Start putty.exe from the USB stick Enter Hostname 127.0.0.1 and Port 2200, then click Open and increase the size of the Putty window At the login prompt (""login as:"") enter ""user"" and enter the user password you set during the Whonix-Gateway installation  5.1. Common Tor configuration  Enter this line at the command prompt (you can paste the text by clicking the right mousebutton inside the Putty window): Quote sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc  Press enter and enter your Whonix-Gateway user password when prompted Scroll down to the bottom of the text by using the cursor keys or the Page Down key on your keyboard  Paste these lines into Putty: Quote AvoidDiskWrites 1 ClientOnly 1 StrictNodes 1  5.2. (Optional) Define exit node countries  Many people don't recommend this, because it may make you less anonymous, but I prefer to have my exit nodes in countries which are not part of the NSA's PRISM program.  If you don't set any exit nodes yourself, then Tor will randomly choose exit nodes for you. As there is a huge amount of exit nodes running in the USA and other PRISM partner countries,  you will often use exit nodes which can be sniffed by the NSA. However, as many websites are in the USA and PRISM partner countries, this is no ultimate protection against getting sniffed by the NSA.  By adding the next line to the bottom of /etc/tor/torrc we make Tor only use ExitNodes in Asia, South Africa and Russia:  Quote ExitNodes {hk},{tw},{za},{in},{id},{th},{vn},{cn},{ru}  You can find a list of more country codes here (these are not always the same as internet top level domains) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2  Note that not all countries have a large amount of ExitNodes, and that it's better if Tor has more than 20 ExitNodes to choose from. Most ExitNodes in this example will most likely be slow, except the ones in China (probably run by their secret service) and Russia. South Korea and Japan also has a lot of ExitNodes, but they may be too friendly with the NSA, so they haven't been added to the list.   5.3. (Optional) Define entry node countries  If there are enough Tor relays in your country, you should only use EntryNodes in your country. If you are in the USA, add this line to the end of /etc/tor/torrc:  Quote EntryNodes {us}   If you are not from the USA, check the above list of country codes to find out which code your country uses. These are not internet top level domains.  If you want to use specific trusted EntryNodes in your country, e.g. because you always want to have a fast entry node with large bandwidth, then you can specify those by using fingerprints.  In this case You should at least add 3 EntryNodes then, better more.  manning2.torservers.net, bolobolo1.torservers.net and manning1.torservers.net are among the fastest EntryNodes in the USA (and the world) right now, so you may want to use them, if you live in the USA. Instead of using the above EntryNodes example, you'd have to use something like this:  EntryNodes $D0236B1908B3CC686DB0A361F4931073A25793F1,$9F7A37446BC034B4FDB27CAE2C6CAAB83A40A361,$073F27934762FF8BA956FFCE136AAC1CCF45EA13  To get more fingerprints of servers, go to http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ and click on the servernames. Copy the fingerpint line and add a $ in front of each fingerprint. Seperate individual fingerprints in the config with commas. Remove spaces in the fingerprints. You should use at least 3-10 fingerprints as entry nodes.  5.4. (Optional) Tor bridges  Instead of using public EntryNodes you may want to use Tor bridges, but this may not help against NSA sniffing. They may know the bridges from https://bridges.torproject.org/ anyway. To have a very secret bridge you'd have to use hidden bridges run by your friends. As with the EntryNodes, you should use at least 5-10 bridges.  To use bridges you'd have to add the line  UseBridges 1  to the end of your /etc/tor/torrc. To get a list of bridges, go to https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges and copy the list of IP addresses it shows you. Paste the addresses at the end of your /etc/tor/torrc text file and add ""Bridge "" (note the space) before each IP address.   This will however not show you only bridges from your country, but from random countries. When you connect to a bridge in another country, then it is more likely that one or more secret services sniff your traffic. This would allow them to do time/size correlation when you browse clearnet websites.  It may be best if you skip the Tor bridges part and only use the EntryNodes part of this tutorial, unless you know how to find out in which countries those bridges are hosted. If you do use bridges, then the EntryNodes line will be ignored by Tor.     Once you're done with the Tor configuration text file, save it by pressing CTRL + x followed by pressing ""y"" the enter key",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Vicious_Delicious","3812","2013-11-20T13:16:59","Tutorial: Portable Encrypted Whonix on a Windows USB Stick","Discussion/Security","8. Using Whonix  Congratulations. The installation of Whonix is complete. You can now create snapshots in VirtualBox if you like. However it is not recommended (by overly paranoid people) to use the Restore Snapshoot feature of VirtualBox every time, instead you should properly shutdown the virtual machines (start button on desktop or ""sudo halt"" on the command line/gateway) and boot them normally when you want to use Whonix again. Especially the snapshot of the Whonix-Gateway should not get restored every time you use Whonix. Instead you should restore the snapshot only if you broke something or you think you may have been under attack by malware.   [WARNING] If you restore a snapshot, all changes made after the snapshot will be lost. So if you've made important changes to Whonix or the browser, you may want to create another snapshot and delete the old one. [/WARNING]  Before taking the snapshot you may also want to disable the Shared Clipboard feature from the Devices menu in VirtualBox. Overly paranoid users do not recommend to have this turned on all the time.  To create a snapshot, click the ""Machine"" menu in the running virtual machine window and select ""Take Snapshot"". You can basically create an unlimited number of snapshots, this is only limited by the size of your TrueCrypt container. Deleting a snapshot will merge it with the previous machine state, so the changes you made before taking the snapshot will be made permanent.  8.1. Booting the virtual machines  Plug the USB stick into a Windows computer, open the USB drive folder and start Truecrypt.exe Select the drive letter you used while creating the TrueCrypt container (in this tutorial we used drive letter L:) Click the ""Select File"" button and choose the ""crypt"" file on your USB stick Click ""Mount"" and enter your TrueCrypt password  Start Portable-VirtualBox.exe from the USB stick If it displays an error message you can usually ignore it  Click the green Start arrow to start Whonix-Gateway and wait until it's booted Click the green Start arrow to start Whonix-Workstation   8.2. Using PGP  [IMPORTANT]  PGP is broken in the current version of this tutorial. You can encrypt messages, but you can't decrypt them.  Until this has been fixed you can use GPG4USB to create a key and to encrypt/decrypt text.  Download GPG4USB from http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de to the /home/user folder Click the Konsole icon on the desktop and enter the following line Quote sudo apt-get install unzip  Click the ""Dolphin File Manager"" icon in the KDE task bar Click gpg4usb-xxxx.zip with the right mousebutton and select Extract -> Extract Archive Here  You can start the program by using the Dolphin File Manager and clicking the ""start_linux"" icon in the gpg4usb folder.  [/IMPORTANT]   You can either use GNU Privacy Assistant or Seahorse to manage PGP keys.  GPA can be started by click the start button -> Applications -> GNU Privacy Assistant. Seahorse (Passwords and Keys) can be started from the icon you created on the desktop.  8.2.1. Adding public PGP keys to your keyring  To add a public PGP key to your list, copy it to your clipboard and start Passwords and Keys from the KDE desktop Open the ""Edit"" menu and click ""Paste""  To see the newly added key, click View -> Show any  (Important) Click the newly imported key with your right mousebutton, select Properties, click the Trust tab and click the ""Sign this Key"" button (Important) In the ""Sign Key"" window select ""Casually"" or ""Very Carefully"", click the ""Sign"" button and enter your PGP passphrase  You can now close the ""Passwords and Keys"" window again or add some more keys. The last 2 steps are important because otherwise Geany will refuse to encrypt your messages later.  8.2.2. Encrypting text with Geany  Start Development -> Geany and type or paste your text into the editor Select the whole text, either with Edit -> Select All or by pressing CTRL + A Open Tools -> GeanyPG -> Encrypt, select the recipient(s) and click the ""OK"" button  Select the encrypted text and copy it to your clipboard.  8.2.3. Decrypting text with Geany  This is broken in the current version of this tutorial.  Start Development -> Geany and paste the encrypted text into the editor Select the whole text, either with Edit -> Select All or by pressing CTRL + A Open Tools -> GeanyPG -> Decrypt/Verify and enter your PGP passphrase  8.2.4. Copying your own public PGP key to the clipboard with Seahorse  Start Settings -> Passwords and Keys and select the ""My Personal Keys"" tab Click the key you want to copy with the right mousebutton and select ""Copy"" You can now paste the key into your browser, text editor etc.  8.3. Changing Tor configuration  You can change the configuration of Tor by using Vidalia on the Whonix-Workstation, if you installed the Tor Browser update as suggested in this tutorial.  However it may be better to make those changes on the Whonix-Gateway instead, by using Putty as described in step 5.  8.4. Using shared folders  If you specified shared folders at step 3.2.2.2., have a look at this page to understand how to access them: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions#Shared_Folder  8.5. Updating Whonix  You have to update both, Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway seperately.   Whonix-Workstation: Open Konsole and enter ""sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade"" Whonix-Gateway: Open Konsole and enter ""sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade""  If you want to upgrade not only the software, but the whole OS, you have to use ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" instead.  See this page on how to upgrade the OS in an overly paranoid way: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Install_Software#How_to_install_or_update_with_most_caution.3F     Do you have any suggestions or questions about this tutorial? Im not the man to ask, maybe some of the more techie guys here can help you out. You may also use the Whonix forum to ask your questions, anonymous posting is allowed: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Special:AWCforum/sf/id5/General_Discussion.html",""

When there is a question (*** something (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?), press enter. When you see the command prompt (root@host:~$) again, proceed to the next step.  4.2.4. VirtualBox Guest Additions  To be able to use copy + paste, resize the desktop and use mouse pointer integration, we need to install the VirtualBox Guest additions.  In the Konsole window, enter this line: Quote apt-get install --no-install-recommends virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils Enter ""y"" when prompted.  When you see the command prompt again, enter this line: Quote apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11  When installation is done, enter ""reboot"".  Once the virtual machine rebooted and the desktop is loaded, you should be able to increase the desktop size by resizing the VirtualBox window.  Furthermore you should be able to copy + paste text from your Windows desktop to the KDE desktop, and the virtual machine should stop capturing your mouse pointer.  If that works, proceed right to step 5. If that didn't work, then the VirtualBox Guest Additions weren't installed properly due to version issues. In that case we have to install them through VirtualBox itself.  Click the Konsole icon on the desktop and enter this line and enter your user password when prommpted: Quote sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)  When you see the command prompt again, enter these lines: Quote sudo mkdir /media/cdrom sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  Enter ""y"" when prompted and reboot the virtual machine. You can do this by clicking the KDE start button and clicking ""Leave"".",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Vicious_Delicious","3812","2013-11-20T13:16:34","Tutorial: Portable Encrypted Whonix on a Windows USB Stick","Discussion/Security","6. Preparing Tor Browser  Do not use the ""Update Tor Browser"" icon on the KDE desktop to update the browser, unless you're ok with losing all your browser settings.  If you don't mind losing your browser settings and bookmarks every time you update the browser, and you don't want to use Vidalia, ignore step 6.1.  Click the ""Start Tor Browser"" icon on the desktop and  [IMPORTANT] DEACTIVATE JAVASCRIPT [/IMPORTANT] by clicking the ""S"" icon next to the green onion icon in the browser and selecting ""Forbid Script Globally""  You can then configure your browser as desired, but don't change the language. Otherwise you may become more pseudonymous than anonymous.   6.1. Updating Tor Browser  After starting the Tor Browser, follow the link to the download page  Download ""Tor Browser Bundle for GNU/Linux"" Click Launch Application and OK Click Save Click < User > to change the download folder to your home folder Click Save Close the browser window  Click the Konsole icon on the KDE desktop and type ""ls"" Select the filename of the downloaded archive by holding the left mousebutton (something like ""tor-browser-gnu-linux-i686-2.3.25-12-dev-en-US.tar.gz"") Click the selection with the right mouse button and select Copy Type ""tar -zxf "" (with trailing space), click inside the Konsole window with the right mouse button and select Paste When you see the command prompt again and no error message gets displayed, then the browser has been updated  Use the ""Start Tor Browser"" button, because ""Tor Browser Recommended"" will most likely cease to function. You can delete this icon, and the ""Update Tor Browser"" icon from the KDE desktop to avoid confusion. If necessary you can still start the other browser by using the KDE start menu.   6.2. Testing the browser configuration  Go to http://ip-check.info and click START TEST! All attributes should be green or orange.  Go to http://panopticlick.eff.org and click TEST ME You should see something like ""Within our dataset of several million visitors, only one in 642 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.""  6.3. (optional) Uptodate version of Firefox  If Torbrowser annoys you, you can additionally install the latest version of Firefox. It will automatically get torified by Whonix. The configuration files are stored in another place than those of Tor Browser. Using Torbrowser is probably safer however.  To do this, start Konsole from the desktop and enter ""sudo su"", enter your user password when prompted. Then paste these lines:  Quote echo -e ""\ndeb http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ubuntuzilla/mozilla/apt all main"" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com C1289A29 apt-get update apt-get install firefox-mozilla-build  You can now start Firefox through the KDE start button -> Applications -> Internet -> Browser  To make it more anonymous than pseudonymous, complete step 7 of my other tutorial (Xubuntu). Unfortunately the language part in about:config doesn't seem to work in this installation. Link to the other tutorial step 7: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201405.msg1445799#msg1445799   7. Preparing PGP  7.1. Install PGP tools  KPGP doesn't work in the current version of Whonix. Let's use Seahorse and Geany instead.  Click the Konsole icon on the KDE desktop and enter Quote apt-get install seahorse geany geany-plugin-pg pinentry-gtk2 gpa Enter your user password when prompted, and enter ""y"" when prompted.  Start Development -> Geany from the KDE start button In the Geany window, open Tools menu -> Plugin Manager, check ""GeanyPG"" and click ""OK""  7.2. Creating your PGP key  You can skip this step if you already have a GnuPG keyring from another Linux machine. Simply copy the .gnupg folder to /home/user  Click the start button and enter ""seahorse"" into the search box Click ""Passwords and Keys"" with the right mouse button and select ""Add to Desktop""  Start Passwords and Keys from the start menu or from the desktop Click ""+"" and select PGP key Enter a fake name, fake email and click Advanced key options Set Key Strength to 4096 and click Create",""

It is not the fact that no body does not care I personally think it is the fact that you are trying to stay secure and then adding Windows with VirtualBox to the mix. IF you were to use QubesOS's Xen backend with the Whonix distribution than I can see how this would be a very secure setup. You can also replace Truecrypt with dm-crypt and then you can sleep soundly that you are putting your trust into tested, audited as well as well built open-source software.","Seems like nobody gives a crap about this, shame.This setup is more secure then tails."

(sketchy as fuckingshit)  So I never went back.  Today I had a localbitcoin transfer and I had to use walmart for cashback to get extra cash out, and decided to do the send there.   The second I hand this old bitch the form, she is giving me a disgusted yet cocky attitude and saying ""Oh so your name is fucktard*realnamethere*? Well MoneyGram wants you too call them fucktard."" (complete bullshit shut up you stupid old slut) In the snottiest way an angry old bitch can say it.   The other cashier being much more polite takes it and says she'll be right back.  Shitting my pants in the back of my mind, but not getting too nervous as to raise any suspicions, she finally comes back and in a shaky voice says, ""Sorry, we can't send this.""  So I looked her with a nice strong stare(turning into a porn now) and asked ""why can't you send it?""  Her voice was all rattled and shakey still and said ""I.. uhm.. We just can't."" Sketchiest shit ever.  So I left and went to cub foods and did it.  Wtf was this all about should I be on my toes about this at all?",""

The new laws â the first of many national security reforms â began being debated in the Senate on Tuesday and had previously been sent to a committee for public consultation.  But the 13 recommendations made to government last week by the powerful Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security concerning the legislation â which it examined and held public hearings on â have not satisfied the Australian Lawyers Alliance, university academics, the Greens, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance and digital rights group Electronic Frontiers Australia. Greens Senator Scott Ludlam says he and his party will not support the bill.  They say the recommendations do not address grave concerns they hold about the bill giving ASIO the power to monitor the entire internet with just one warrant and restricting what journalists write.  The committee's recommendations to the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2014 have been accepted by the government in full.  It is understood the associated government amendments, announced on Friday, were circulated to Labor earlier than to other parties and independent senators, who received them on Tuesday when they were tabled in parliament. One of those amendments, announced on Monday by Attorney-General George Brandis and new ASIO chief Duncan Lewis, explicitly rules out ""torture"" being conducted by intelligence officers. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus didn't initially support some of the new laws.  Labor has indicated that if all amendments are adopted it is likely to pass the bill. This means the laws will pass even if there is crossbench opposition.  But Professor George Williams of UNSW said the laws and their amendments did not address serious concerns they could enable agencies to tap, access and disrupt target and third-party computers and networks across Australia after getting just one warrant.  Dr Williams previously warned the PJCIS that the laws were too broad and could allow ASIO to monitor the entire Australian internet as a ""computer network"", as defined in the new laws. Tourist attraction: An armed AFP officer maintains guard outside Parliament House in Canberra as debate over new national security legislation began in the Senate.   ""The problem is [this specific new law regardless of amendments] applies to computer networks and the internet is a computer network â it's a network of networks,"" he said.  Jon Lawrence, of digital rights group Electronic Frontiers Australia, agreed.  ""I think the drafting of this is so vague that it really could be extended,"" he said. Duncan Lewis, the new ASIO chief, was introduced by Senator Brandis on Monday when the minister announced he would explicitly rule out ""torture"" under new national security legislation.   ""A network can essentially be anything from three computers on a Wi-Fi modem to potentially an entire corporate network or an entire internet service provider network or at the extreme end the whole internet,"" he said.  Dr Williams suggested the warrant process should be restricted to only accessing parts of a computer network necessary to gather intelligence.  ""I accept that [agencies] should be able to access [a university or another organisation's computer] network but it should be strictly limited to those parts of the network to gain the intelligence on a particular [target],"" he said. Christopher Warren, federal secretary of the journalist union, the MEAA, does not support the new laws.  Dr Williams also said section 35P â which jails people who ""recklessly"" reveal information related to a ""special intelligence operation"" (SIO) â would have a ""chilling effect"" on journalists and whistleblowers attempting to disclose information. Professor George Williams of UNSW says the laws are too broad.  The lawyer for whistleblower and former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Jesselyn Radack, has previously labelled the legislation as ""draconian"" and ""chilling"" while NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake said they reminded him of his trial and would result in self-censorship by disclosers.  The legislation makes it an offence if a person ""discloses information ... [that] relates to a special intelligence operation"" and does not state any public interest exemptions, meaning it could apply to anyone including journalists.  Those who disclosed such information would face up to 10 years' jail.  A PJCIS recommendation adopted by the government does, however, allow the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and lawyers to be informed of the information for media or whistleblowers seeking legal advice, but not anyone else.  Dr Williams was supported in his opposition to section 35P by a group of media organisations, including AAP, the ABC, APN, Fairfax Media, FreeTV, News Corp and others, who said in a joint submission to the PJCIS in August that 35P should ""not be included in the legislation"".  ""[Its] insertion ... could potentially see journalists jailed for undertaking and discharging their legitimate role in a modern democratic society â reporting in the public interest,"" they said.  Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus initially appeared to oppose 35P, saying in August that the way it was drafted then meant it was ""not necessary"".  ""It is an unprecedented overreach of government power which poses a real threat to the freedom of the press,"" Dreyfus said.  On Tuesday his spokeswoman said he was now satisfied with it given government amendments.  ""These changes balance the need to protect the safety of ASIO employees engaged in SIOs, while ensuring that journalists are not in danger of being penalised for simply doing their jobs,"" his spokeswoman said.  Christopher Warren of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents journalists, said the amendments did not give him confidence journalists would not be put at risk.  ""The recommendations do seem to take some steps forward in that they improve parliamentary and governmental oversight of ASIO but they do nothing to improve community or media oversight of these important issues,"" he said.  ""[The new laws] will leave ASIO with substantial powers to intervene in the work of media and of journalists, to persecute and to prosecute whistleblowers and indeed journalists who are dealing with whistleblowers,"" he said.  He added it was the alliance's view that under the new legislation publishing stories like many of the Edward Snowden revelations, including the revelation about the tapping of government phones in Indonesia, ""could well become a criminal offence"" in the future rather than a public interest matter.  One of the amendments government made to 35P was that the Director of Public Prosecution must take into account the public interest, including the public interest in publication, before initiating a prosecution of a whistleblower or journalist for the disclosure of an SIO.  But Greg Barns of the Australian Lawyers Association said this clause was ""bullshit"".  ""The Director of Public Prosecution in every case it prosecutes uses a public interest test,"" he said.  Mr Barns added that the DPP would be under ""considerable pressure"" by government to prosecute anyone who disclosed information.  He said the laws would have ""not just a chilling effect but a freezing effect"" on national security reporting.  Senator Ludlam of the Greens told Fairfax Media his party would be opposing the bill in the Senate and moving significant amendments.  Senator Lazarus, of the Palmer United Party, has also proposed minor amendments.  Senator Ludlam said the premise of the bill was flawed.  ""The special intelligence operations framework ... is effectively unamendable, [as is] the idea that journalists or somebody sharing an item on Facebook could be jailed for ten years for basically disclosing information in the public interest,"" he said.  ""Also [flawed is] the idea that ASIO's definition of a computer network ... could encompass the entire internet.""","how about putting up a link to these ""new "" laws so we can see what you are talking about"

To further this, find some aluminum ducting tape at your local hardware store. Cut a strip, place it on a table adhesive side up, and invert the bottle to press the mouth/rim against the adhesive. Push a bit, then trace the rim with a precision Xacto knife. Flip it over, smooth it out, and you're good.  Works well with supplement bottles as well, however at a festival this is more scrutinized. Be sure to add some cotton/silica dessicants to both prevent your pills/product from sticking to the tape as well as give the bottle the full and brand-new retail look.  Happy smuggling.",""

The fake âtowersâ â computers which wirelessly attack cellphones via the âbasebandâ chips built to allow them to communicate with their networks, can eavesdrop and even install spyware, ESD claims. They are a known technology - but the surprise is that they are in active use.  The towers were found by users of the CryptoPhone 500, one of several ultra-secure handsets that have come to market in the last couple of years, after an executive noticed his handset was âleakingâ data regularly.  Its American manufacturer boasts that the handset has a âhardenedâ version of Android which removes 468 vulnerabilities from the OS. Android Security: Towers in casinos  Despite its secure OS, Les Goldsmith of the handsetâs US manufacturer ESD found that his personal Android security handsetâs firewall showed signs of attack â80 to 90â times per hour.  The leaks were traced to the mysterious towers. Despite having some of the functions of normal cellphone towers, Goldsmith says their function is rather different. He describes them as âinterceptorsâ and says that various models can eavesdrop and even push spyware to devices. Normal cellphones cannot detect them â only specialized hardware such as ESDâs Android security handsets.  Who created the towers and maintains them is unknown, Goldsmith says. Origin of towers âunknownâ  âInterceptor use in the U.S. is much higher than people had anticipated,â Goldsmith says.  âOne of our customers took a road trip from Florida to North Carolina and he found eight different interceptors on that trip.  We even found one at South Point Casino in Las Vegas.â  Their existence can only be seen on specialized devices, such as the custom Android security OS used by Cryptophone, which includes various security features â including âbaseband attack detection.â  The handset, based on a Samsung Galaxy SIII, is described as offering, a âHardened Android operating systemâ offering extra security. âBaseband firewall protects against over-the-air attacks with constant monitoring of baseband processor activity, baseband attack detection, and automated initiation of countermeasuresâ, claims the site.  âWhat we find suspicious is that a lot of these interceptors are right on top of U.S. military bases.â says Goldsmith.  âWhose interceptor is it?  Who are they, thatâs listening to calls around military bases?  The point is: we donât really know whose they are.â  Baseband attacks are considered extremely difficult â the details of the chips are closely guarded. âInterceptorsâ are costly devices â and hacking baseband chips is thought to be technically advanced beyond the reach of âordinaryâ hackers, ESD says. The devices vary in form, and are sold to government agencies and others, but are computers with specialized software designed to defeat the encryption of cellphone networks. The towers target the âBasebandâ operating system of cellphones â a secondary OS which sits âbetweenâ iOS or Android, for instance, and the cellular network.  Goldsmith says that the devices cost âless than $100,000â and does not mention what level or type of device his team has detected. Most are still out of reach of average hackers, although freely advertised. One model is the VME Dominator, which is described as, âa real time GSM A5.1 cell phone interceptor. It cannot be detected. It allows interception of voice and text. It also allows voice manipulation, up or down channel blocking, text intercept and modification, calling & sending text on behalf of the user, and directional finding of a user during random monitoring of calls.â  What has come as a surprise is how many âinterceptorsâ are in active use in the U.S., and that their purpose remains mysterious.",""

Hunt, the Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (âDEAâ), and Toni Weirauch, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (âIRS-CIâ), announced the unsealing of criminal charges in Manhattan federal court against ROBERT M. FAIELLA, a/k/a âBTCKing,â an underground Bitcoin exchanger, and CHARLIE SHREM, the Chief Executive Officer and Compliance Officer of a Bitcoin exchange company, for engaging in a scheme to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to users of âSilk Road,â the underground website that enabled its users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement. Each defendant is charged with conspiring to commit money laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. SHREM is also charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding FAIELLAâs illegal transactions through the Company, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. SCHREM was arrested yesterday at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. FAIELLA was arrested today at his residence in Cape Coral, Florida, and is expected to be presented in federal court in the Middle District of Florida.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: âAs alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly innovative business models donât need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.âDEA Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge James J. Hunt said: âThe charges announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way. Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.âIRS Special-Agent-in-Charge Toni Weirauch said: âThe government has been successful in swiftly identifying those responsible for the design and operation of the âSilk Roadâ website, as well as those who helped âSilk Roadâ customers conduct their illegal transactions by facilitating the conversion of their dollars into Bitcoins. This is yet another example of the New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Forceâs proficiency in applying financial investigative resources to the fight against illegal drugs.âAccording to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:From about December 2011 to October 2013, FAIELLA ran an underground Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website, a website that served as a sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar where illegal drugs of virtually every variety were bought and sold regularly by the siteâs users. Operating under the username âBTCKing,â FAIELLA sold Bitcoins â the only form of payment accepted on Silk Road â to users seeking to buy illegal drugs on the site. Upon receiving orders for Bitcoins from Silk Road users, he filled the orders through a company based in New York, New York (the âCompanyâ). The Company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash for Bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. FAIELLA obtained Bitcoins with the Companyâs assistance, and then sold the Bitcoins to Silk Road users at a markup.SHREM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from about August 2011 until about July 2013, when the Company ceased operating, he was also its Compliance Officer, in charge of ensuring the Companyâs compliance with federal and other anti-money laundering (âAMLâ) laws. SHREM is also the Vice Chairman of a foundation dedicated to promoting the Bitcoin virtual currency system.SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated FAIELLAâs business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLAâs business as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA to use the Companyâs services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers; personally processed FAIELLAâs orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLAâs illicit activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Companyâs Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the Companyâs AML restrictions, even though it was SHREMâs job to enforce them and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as a money services business.Working together, SHREM and FAIELLA exchanged over $1 million in cash for Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road.In late 2012, when the Company stopped accepting cash payments, FAIELLA ceased doing business with the Company and temporarily shut down his illegal Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road. FAIELLA resumed operating on Silk Road in April 2013 without the Companyâs assistance, and continued to exchange tens of thousands of dollars a week in Bitcoins until the Silk Road website was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013.*                      *                      *FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. SHREM is also charged with one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the DEAâs New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force, which is comprised of agents and officers of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the New York City Police Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations, the New York State Police, the U. S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Marshal Service, New York National Guard, Office of Foreign Assets Control and the New York Department of Taxation and Finance. Mr. Bharara also thanked the FBIâs New York Field Office.Mr. Bharara also noted that the investigation remains ongoing.The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Officeâs Complex Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Serrin Turner is in charge of the prosecution, and Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Adams of the Asset Forfeiture Unit is in charge of the forfeiture aspects of the case.The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty."

However, most of us can't intimdate or bribe banks into looking the other way at these sort of transactions. I assure you, if you try to make a deposit or purchase anywhere for $9,999 unless it is a coincidence, you are going to get looked at suspiciously. Even if they don't tell.  Attempting to deposit just below the limit at one or multiple locations is a practice called STRUCTURING.

When I first started cashing in, I was an idiot, walking around with a money clip packed with $100's and a wallet bulging with a couple of grand wherever I went. Now that I've grown up a little I've realized that looking like an obvious drug dealer isn't that cool anymore and there's more to life than impressing a couple of shopkeepers and bartenders by pulling out wads of cash when you purchase things. When I leave the house now, if I'm not specifically bringing money for a large purchase I usually put $300-400 in my wallet and carry an anonymous VISA card loaded with $9K, so I can still make any purchases I want at shops and restaurants but I don't draw any unnecessary suspicion upon myself.  If you want to look rich, buy a nice watch and wear tailored business clothes, don't be the guy waving wads of cash around.  If you are transporting large amounts of cash for business purposes I recommend soaking the notes in isopropyl alcohol (To remove any drug residue) and then vacuum sealing them down into more manageable bricks. I usually vacuum seal notes in bricks of $20K and then use a heat-proof adhesive to secure them to a hidden spot in the engine of a inconspicuous car. While transporting cash I ensure that any occupants of the car have no drugs or other illegal items on them and the car is road-worthy with it's registration up to date and not linked to a person with a criminal record. The car is driven at the speed limit and all traffic rules obeyed.  For storage of large amounts of cash I recommend capping the ends of a piece of PVC pipe with a screw-cap attachment and then burying the pipe at the base of a tree you can easily find again in a secluded part of a forest. You can easily bury pretty much any sum of money this way and safely store it for an indefinite period of time.",""

Going 62 in a 50-mph zone, a Jeep barreled west on a slippery, snow-covered Airport Expressway on Valentineâs Day and blew past an Allen County sheriffâs squad car.  One traffic stop later, two men inside the Jeep were outside being patted down by officers. They acted nervous, according to a police report. At one point they looked as if they wanted to fight; at another they looked as if they wanted to flee.  In the Jeepâs back seat, police found more than $26,000 in cash wrapped in a stocking cap.  Though officers held the two men for a short time in squad cars, they were eventually released without charges, save for the driver receiving a citation for driving with a suspended license.  And the money? The police kept it.  Having that much cash is not a crime, but police have the right to seize it if they suspect it has been used or procured through criminal means. Most of the money seized comes from drug cases and can then be used by various law enforcement agencies.  And at least one local agency, the Allen County Prosecutorâs Office, has taken a more aggressive approach in forfeiture cases, with the amount of money in its state seizure fund growing from more than $53,000 in 2004 to more than $105,000 in 2008, according to Allen Countyâs Chief Deputy Prosecutor Michael McAlexander.  âWeâve gotten a little more aggressive,â said McAlexander, citing better communication with police in how confiscations work locally. âWeâve created a better process.â  In the situation with the $26,000, police seized the money because the driver could not give an adequate reason for having that much money. First, the driver said it was to buy a car, according to the police report. Then, he said it came from working at various jobs. The passenger said he had no clue about the money.  Those factors allowed police to take the money.  âIf itâs way, way over and above what a normal person will carry, and if things donât add up (on how it was acquired), we take the money,â said Lt. Art Barile, head of the sheriff departmentâs vice and narcotics unit and the Allen County Drug Task Force, a multiagency unit run out of the sheriffâs department.  How often money is confiscated from people not charged with crimes is hard to determine, Barile said, but his best guess for his department is that it happens âmaybe 10 percent of the timeâ his department performs a seizure.  Allen County Prosecutor Karen Richards said her office seldom sees forfeitures without criminal charges attached.  Bob Trgovich, assistant U.S. attorney at the local federal court, said itâs not necessarily a rare practice for his office but it does happen, sometimes with more drawn-out cases.  âWe had a case a few years ago where members of this conspiracy, over the course of two years, were stopped several times,â he said. âEach time they were stopped, they had large amounts of money.â  Though the processes may differ with each case and whether itâs handled by federal or state prosecutors, people who typically have money seized must file a claim if they want it back. They have to show how they got the money and that it was procured legally. Many donât even file a claim, according to Trgovich.  âIf you find money in a vehicle, and thatâs all you find, many times (the people) in the vehicle donât want to admit itâs theirs,â Trgovich said.  After money is seized by a law enforcement agency, prosecutors in either state or federal court take over a process that determines where the money ends up. Typically, federal prosecutors handle large amounts of money, such as the $26,000 case, which Barile said has been forwarded to federal authorities. Local prosecutors take the cases with smaller amounts of cash, from $1,000 to $4,000, according to Richards.  Depending on the subtleties of the case and what court is involved, the money usually ends up divided among prosecutors and the police agency or agencies responsible for seizing the money. The process can be long and intricate, though.  âItâs a complicated nightmare, actually,â said Auburn Police Chief Martin McCoy, who sometimes is a spokesman for the IMAGE Drug Task Force, made up of officers from Noble, LaGrange, Steuben and DeKalb counties.  In a state seizure case, the arresting agency must show how much money it used in the investigation that led to the seizure. Prosecutors, too, have to show how much money went into the litigation for the seizures.  âYouâre supposed to take your law enforcement expenses out of (the seized money), which could be anything from the attorneyâs time to write a search warrant, the cost of doing the forfeiture, the court costs, or (drug) buy money for the police department,â Richards said.  In some cases, that money gets funneled back into the respective agencies involved with the seizures, according to Richards, McCoy and Barile.  The money left over after expenses goes to the stateâs Common School Fund, which was established in 1851 and has historically been used to provide low-interest loans for school-building projects.  For example, if police seize $5,000 and the department and prosecutor show the investigation and litigation into the case cost $2,000, the two agencies will probably split $2,000 of the money. The remaining $3,000 goes to the Common School Fund.  A federal seizure typically goes quicker, McCoy said, and the Common School Fund is not in play. A police agency can receive up to 75 percent of the money it seizes, according to Barile and McCoy, while prosecutors at the federal level keep the rest.  According to McCoy, his department does not seize a lot of money, and maybe has one case a year that results in the confiscation of more than $5,000. When the Auburn Police Department seizes money, whatever is recouped usually goes into a general fund for the city of Auburn, and the police department does not see that money again.  If the IMAGE Task Force takes the money, it usually gets that cash back. But, he said, itâs not like seizures are in abundance in his jurisdiction.  âWeâre not getting rich on seizures, by any means,â he said. ",""

They can freeze them as in freeze a bank account, but when laundered properly an attorney will be able to prove the funds are not part of a drug scheme and the funds will be unfrozen and often you will be compensated if it effected your business in anyway.    We are talking about cash here, like $$ bills. Like if LE caught you with 100K cash they can seize it, and then you have to go through the whole process of proving it's legit (again easy with an attorney) but it's just time consuming. So, it's better to not have large sums of cash sitting about.

Seems like our SR community has it's own Heisenberg        We are talking about illicit funds though I believe. If the post office confiscate 10K from you, they'll notigy the IRS and then they'll want to know where the money is coming from.   Again, travellers cheques you have to sign for. Basically meaning you are accepting the fact that this money is yours. If you're ever caught, what do you plan on saying?    It's not so much the LE we are trying to fool when it comes to money, it's the IRS and if the IRS don't think they are getting their cut they'll open an investigation with the LE on you to get what they want.  Just like when the LE want to bust you, they'll often use the IRS/banking systems to check for any unaccounted money and hope you've slipped up.   The IRS want their tax payments. They don't care if it's legal or not to some extent. I mean if they notice suspicous activity they will report it but it's the LE who want to bust you with bucket fulls of cash as that leads to nice christmas bonuses for their deparment.   If you plan to launder decent amounts of money regularly and properly, you're going to need some form of business to do it right.  ","You can spray some nerve agent on one of the bills you mark so when they steal it then when they touch that bill they instantly die. Organo-phosphates (nerve agents) are not difficult to make :-) ... Too extreme?;Unless it was too much for a few people to hide and take home with them.....I don't think you will ever get a visit. Only thing you will get is some lighter pockets.Its all about discretion when it comes to transporting monetary instruments.Postal money orders I do believe have the possibility of recovery if you can file a claim that it is lost before it is cashed.Traveler's Cheques have added security the require counter-signature, and are easily recovered if lost.In any event, putting any of those in the mail is extremely risky. If you're going through the trouble to get them, just keep it on your person. A check or money order isn't as questionable to LE (unless you have like 20 of them or something) and they have a paper trail so they are harder to lift."

The Brazilian National Institute of Criminology (INC) tried unsuccessfully for five months to obtain access to his files on the TrueCrypt-protected disks. They enlisted the help of the FBI, who used dictionary attacks against Dantas' disks for over 12 months, but were still unable to decrypt them."";""Cryptographic locks guarding the secret files of a Brazilian banker suspected of financial crimes have defeated law enforcement officials.Brazilian police seized five hard drives when they raided the Rio apartment of banker Daniel Dantas as part of Operation Satyagraha in July 2008. But subsequent efforts to decrypt files held on the hardware using a variety of dictionary-based attacks failed even after the South Americans called in the assistance of the FBI.The files were encrypted using Truecrypt and an unnamed algorithm, reportedly based on the 256-bit AES standard. In the UK, Dantas would be compelled to reveal his passphrase under threat of imprisonment, but no such law exists in Brazil.The Brazilian National Institute of Criminology (INC) tried for five months to obtain access to the encrypted data without success before turning over the job to code-breakers at the FBI in early 2009. US computer specialists also drew a blank even after 12 months of efforts to crack the code, Brazil's Globo newspaper reports.The case is an illustration of how care in choosing secure (hard-to-guess) passwords and applying encryption techniques to avoid leaving file fragments that could aid code breakers are more important in maintaining security than the algorithm a code maker chooses. In other cases, law enforcement officials have defeated suspects' use of encryption because of weak cryptographic trade craft or poor passwords, rather than inherent flaws in encryption packages."

Security issues   There are a few security issues with this approach though.When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in Tails.The main issue is if the host operating system is compromised with a software keylogger or other malware, which Tails does not provide any protection against â in fact, that is impossible.Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.As such, this is only recommended when the other alternative is not an option or when you are absolutely sure that your host system is clean.That's why Tails warns you when you are running it inside a virtual machine. Do not expect Tails to protect you if you run it in a virtual machine if you do not trust the host computer, Tails is not magical!If you read this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual machine: there could be a bug in the virtualization detection software Tails uses... or something really weird is happening.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/index.en.html  Having read this, i don't see a massive issue in running tails on a VM.

Service.â From its base in Las Vegas, the online storefront manufactured driverâs licenses for 13 states and shipped them to buyers around the world. No questions asked.  With a reputation for quality and the fastest turnaround in the industry, Celtic was a no-nonsense player in a global underworld benighted by drama and infighting. On the Russian-led criminal forum Carder.su, his primary home, he accumulated scores of glowing reviews from satisfied customers. âYou can trust him,â wrote Oink Oink. âThis guy doesnât fuck around. Great shit, great communication and bends over backwards to help you out.â  âI agree Celtic is great,â wrote XXXSimone. âI placed an order, instantly he sent the order out did not bullshit around.â  A customer named Temp agreed. âStrongly recommended! Fast shipment, and very good discounts!â  Today Billy âOink-Oinkâ Steffey, Maceo âXXXSimoneâ Boozer III, and Alexander âTempâ Kostyukov might not be so generous with their praise, as they await a November trial in the largest identity theft prosecution in U.S. history. Their mistake? In addition to being a talented ID forger, Celtic was a Secret Service agent.  The government calls it âOperation Open Market,â a four-year investigation resulting, so far, in four federal grand jury indictments against 55 defendants in 10 countries, facing a cumulative millennium of prison time. What many of those alleged scammers, carders, thieves, and racketeers have in common is one simple mistake: They bought their high-quality fake IDs from a sophisticated driverâs license counterfeiting factory secretly established, owned, and operated by the United States Secret Service.  The Secret Service announced Operation Open Market in a press release in March of last year when the first set of indictments dropped. But the agency hasnât publicly disclosed how it made the busts. That story is told in internal agency documents seen by WIRED, correlated with archival posts from Carder.su and court records. Itâs the story of how the Secret Service, in an operation as ironic as it was bold, stole the identity of a low-ranking member of the underground in May 2007, and, with top-level Justice Department approval, used it for years afterward to produce and sell some of the best fake IDs available anywhere.  In the process, the agency built dossiers on identity thieves around the world and discovered the undergroundâs extensive use of the online payment service Liberty Reserve, which spawned a parallel Secret Service and Treasury Department investigation with its own round of arrests in May.  âBy selling the counterfeit identifications, it allowed the UCA [undercover agent] potential to identify individuals operating on the carding portals and develop an understanding of the internal workings of the organization,â reads an August 2011 memorandum produced by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which supported the Secret Service in the operation.  âThe prosecutorial strategy centers on disrupting and dismantling the Carder.su organization while at the same time acting as a deterrent to similar organizations that may be operating under the belief that because they are outside U.S. territory they are safe from U.S. law enforcement,â the report continues, adding that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was personally briefed on the operation.  The Secret Service, DHS, and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Nevada declined to discuss the investigation.  Open Market isnât an unsullied win for the agency. Most of the operationâs biggest targets are still at large â many out of reach in Eastern European countries where U.S. extradition is tricky. The bulk of those who have been rounded up are rank-and-file fraudsters, some of whom face outsized penalties under the mob-busting RICO act. Meanwhile scores of fake ID cards made and sold by the government are still floating around. ",""

I plead guilty and I never thought I would see that money again. Now I get this letter from the police department saying they have property that thier records show belongs to me and I can come pick it up. The letter doesn't say why theyre giving it back. it tells the exact amount of cash they took in the letter but it doesn't say anything about the arrest, it pretty much just says ""we have your property, come get it at the police station within 30 days"". I'm thinking it has to do with a cop that was arrested for stealing cash from the evidence room several months after they took my money. The cop was found not guilty recently, and the letter I got is dated the day after the acquittal. So maybe they are covering their asses because they dipped into my siezed money and are preparing for an audit; since the courts think the cop that was stealing is still there.   Anyways, I just wanted to hear what this sounds like to you guys because I've never heard of them returning siezed money after a conviction especially 4 years later.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","4547","2013-11-27T05:57:18","Need advice","Discussion/Security"," Tumbling is a way to helping to disguise the ownership of your coins.  Remember that everything in the blockchain is PUBLIC -- all transactions are recorded there. If you don't tumble your coins, it makes it easier for LEA to trace them back to a particular supplier, and potentially you as the buyer.  Because of pressure from various governments (primarily the U.S.) many bitcoin exchanges are being forced to implement anti-money-laundering procedures, which includes keeping records on their customers.  The very last thing you want is to have your coins traceable back to your real identity.

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","BuckshoT","4547","2013-11-26T10:25:01","Need advice","Discussion/Security","I gotchu  1. Ok so first off, you're going to want to install and learn PGP, here is a link to the guide i'm pretty sure I used. http://www.reddit.com/r/SheepMarketplace/comments/1ok7k7/a_complete_guide_to_set_up_pgp_also_pgp/  The PgP took me a while to get, but once you get it it's really simple. The link should be a download for Kleopatra. PgP is used to encrypt messeges and such. For SR you use it when ordering. It protects your sensitive info like Name, Address and all that.  2. Now for buying Bitcoin. I'm not really sure where is best in the UK, but you can just google purchase bitcoin in google and browse the different services. If you see one you want to use make sure you do research on it and verify that it's legitimate and not a scam. Usually, you'll have to buy bitcoin through your bank account, thus verifying your identity and such...LocalBitcoins exists in the US which allows people to meet face to face to buy bitcoin completely anonymously. (You can not buy bitcoins using .tor, websites won't let you,)  3.Now that you have some bitcoin, you're going to need to tumble them, or wash them. Go to Blockchain.ifo or something like that. I'm not sure if it's .ifo but that can be easily figured out. Make an account on that, or bitcoinfog, or both actually. You are now going to deposit the bitcoins from whatever website you bought em off into blockchain or bitcoinfog. Now you're gonna log off clearnet.  4. Log onto Tor, access your blockchain/bitcoin fog account, and send those bitcoins to your deposit address on SR. Ready to make purchases.  That's been my process. I'm not exactly sure how safe it is, but hopefully it is. If anyone see's something wrong with this, please correct me. I wouldn't want to be teaching this guy/chick the wrong ways. Also I would like to not get burned myself.  BuckshoT",""

Go to www.brainwallet.org ... save the whole  website to your hard disk (Save Page As). Make sure you have javascript enabled, now you can open the offline website and generate new wallets, do conversions, and even send transactions offline and online.  For the newbs: A wallet is a set of two strings, one  string is a private key and one is a public key, this is an example of a wallet:  Private key:    5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS Public key:    1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T  The private key is your actual wallet, if you have that you can see what the public key is, but not the other way around. You don't need to download any special software like electrum or bitcoin QT to generate or open a wallet. Your private key IS the wallet. So how do you send  money with a private key? Make a wallet on blockchain.info and import the private key! You are done! Now you can send money. The other way is through the brainwallet.org offline site. Go to transactions tab and  paste the private key into the field. Enter amount and destination wallet. If you are connected to the internet click send and it  will push the transaction through the blockchain. If you are offline, copy the raw transaction text all the way at the bottom. Then go to an online computer and using bitcoin QT go to debug mode and type: sendrawtransaction ""enter string here""      - paste the raw transaction text where the quotes are but without the quotes and then press enter. OR go to www.blockchain.info/pushtx  and  paste the raw transaction text and then click on Submit Transaction, done!  To make a new wallet, open the saved brainwallet.org site and where it says passphrase type in some random gibberish, as you type you'll see the private key and public key below changing. Once you are happy with the length and complexity of the passphrase, save the private key and public key.  You can save them in notepad and on CD/Flash Drive/etc and/or print it out. This is your new wallet.    Other tips:  Don't use the ""random"" wallet generator, it has been proven to be unsafe and people have lost coins. You can use the sign and verify tabs to prove that you own a wallet and verify that someone owns a wallet. This has many uses, one example is to show someone that you have the BTC in control before doing a transaction (Proof of Funds). This is done by signing a message with your private key (wallet) using the Sign tab.  The counterparty then checks the signature using the Verify tab. Another use is two-factor authentication like PGP.",""

The problem is your money's security is riding on the strength of your password. There was a thread I read about this awhile back. I am sure you can Google it and find it, but it was offering up the bitcoin to anyone who could guess the passwords to brain wallets they had created. So someone can sit all day and just guess passwords until they find a wallet, then steal the funds... Unlike traditional bitcoin clients where you have to have the private key and the password to move the coins, brain wallets will allow you to move coins with only the password...   I do not see how this is more safe then say electrum?   As far as moving money offline, it works much like paper wallets. The money moves from location to location physically but stays in the same wallet. So you would not end up with ""unspendable"" bitcoin. You would end up moving the coins out of the same wallet address they went into.  Think about it like this, if you put cash in a wallet and then give your wallet to a friend, He turns around and gives it someone else. This person wants to spend the cash, so they take money out of the wallet. It will come out of the same wallet you put it in.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Wonton","2360","2013-11-08T21:01:56","putting gpg4usb on a usb","Discussion/Security"," You would have to spend $$ for a commercial product. Truecrypt is free, easy to use and very secure. See the guide at http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/tutorial  If you have a 16 GB flash drive you can make the Truecrypt container as large as the drive, you may want to make only 14-15 GB so there is some unencrypted space left for transferring files if needed. If your flash drive is formatted FAT or FAT32 you must reformat it NFTS first before using the Truecrypt wizard, because the maximum file size using FAT or FAT32 is only 4 GB.   Tips when you are following the Truecrypt guide, some of the instructions can be confusing:  1) create a blank text file on your desktop, name it whatever you like. You will enter the name of this file when creating your Truecrypt container, when the program asks for 'volume location' select your blank text file. After your container is made instead of a text file you will have a Truecrypt container that looks like a text file on your desktop but will be encrypted and 14-15 GB in size, whatever you chose.   2) Once your Truecrypt container is made you can move it wherever you like, it is completely portable. Just mount your container using your password, put your data and programs like gpg4usb inside, unmount and move to your USB drive.   Always cheaper to roll your own than buy a commercial product.

I also noticed however that this transcaction was completely visible and unobfuscated on the Blockchain, meaning that anyone could see that I had sent money to this tumbler.

WARNING: CLEARNET GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/goshakkk/decentralized-anonymous-marketplace-concept  While I like the idea of decentralisation in general, there are a few concerns I have with this guy's proposal:  Firstly, he suggests that instead of using a centralised wallet to store bitcoins (which can be seized as happened with SR), users use their own bitcoin addresses in conjunction with bitcoin's built-in escrow functionality (choosing a reputable third-party from amongst several providers to administrate the escrow). Whilst the having multiple competitors offering escrow services (perhaps charging different fees) might provide some benefit, and would relieve the work-load of a central authority in dispute resolution, allowing independent service providers (even with the sort of reputation system he suggests) opens up the possibility of scammers. For example, a vendor/buyer could offer a modest bribe to a dishonest arbitrator in return for them signing off on the transaction (worth a larger amount than the bribe) in the briber's favour.  The greatest concern though is about security, with buyers and vendors using their own bitcoin addresses: assuming a vendor generates a new address for every transaction they should remain anonymous initially (from this single transaction no statistical analysis methods can be used to link the address to anything other than the purchaser's address), however if LE or some other malicious agent were to make a purchase and obtain a (new) address owned by the vendor, then all they need to do is watch that address and if the vendor neglects to use an effective tumbling service then they would be able to link his addresses together and possibly to his other online or real-world identities.  In a centralised market utilising an effective mixing service, the fact that bitcoins were withdrawn from the market to a specific address can be gleaned, but the withdrawal cannot be connected to any specific illegal transactions; if a vendor is sloppy with his security, his identity could be linked to an address used to withdraw bitcoins from an illegal marketplace, which could put him at risk of a bust. But in this proposed decentralised marketplace, if a vendor is sloppy with his security, his identity could be linked to SPECIFIC illegal activities which he could be tried and convicted for WITHOUT the need for any further evidence.  With customer deposits, in a centralised market with a mixing service it's possible to ascertain that someone who controls a certain bitcoin address deposited money into the marketplace, but with a decentralised system one can see that a certain bitcoin address participated in a certain transaction - if the vendor has taken adequate precautions with anonymity, then this is perfect as one can't even tell that that transaction had anything to do with the marketplace; if however the vendor is lax, it may be possible to link a customer's identity to payments to a specific vendor (customers are generally a lot less protective of their identities, through lack of real necessity: no doubt some would pay vendors directly from MtGox accounts in their real names).  It is certainly not the case that every transaction on the marketplace would be risky, but rather than making a single decision about whether or not to trust the security of a centralised marketplace in general (although even then one should ideally not be complacent), customers would have to decide on a case by case basis whether to trust the security of individual vendors (unless of course they were deliberately very careful with their own security). The issue is not necessarily that the marketplace would be less secure, just that the burden of security would be heavier on users than in a centralised marketplace.  Both of these concerns would have to be borne in mind by users, but wouldn't necessarily lead to wide-spread systemic issues if users were careful about who they chose to deal with (which would be aided by a reputation system and/or forums). Vendors especially, if they employed adequate security, and were savvy about which escrow providers they allowed, shouldn't run into any problems in these respects. However, relying on customers to authorise bitcoin transactions from their own addresses rather than depositing money into a central wallet before spending it would cause widespread headaches. If users were able to submit purchases before actually sending payment, then I foresee a lot of administrative headaches with users either not sending payments, or under or overpaying (for example sending a payment for the correct amount, but forgetting about miners' fees so the amount the vendor receives is slightly under), or sending transactions with a different escrow provider than the one the vendor agreed upon. In fact, in order for the escrow system to work, the buyer would presumably first need to approach the vendor to agree an escrow provider, then contact the escrow provider to make sure they're okay with it, then contact the vendor again to confirm the purchase, requiring two buyer-seller exchanges per sale and effectively doubling the workload of busy vendors in the first place (not even taking into account payment discrepencies). Or else this could be minimized if the vendor has a list of pre-approved escrow providers which the buyer selects from a list when purchasing, but then this would defeat the purpose of having a choice of providers as the vendor could require buyers to use a corrupt provider he could bribe whenever a high-value order came in.  The last major point of his proposal, and the part I find most exciting idealogically (but the most scary pragmatically), is the idea of having the marketplace co-hosted by several nodes - that way if one or even several are taken down, then the site keeps going (as long as there is at least one node left). The code for the marketplace would have to be open source for this to work, which has the advantage that anyone can discover its weaknesses and fix them, and the disadvantage that anyone can discover its weaknesses and manipulate them. The code would have to be very strong to stay resilient to the same routes of attack used to try and get at centralised marketplaces, in addition to threats posed by dummy nodes with modified code.  Finally, there is a question about the security of the individual nodes. Node operators have the legal advantage of not actually handling any of the proceeds from illegal transactions directly (though presumably they would have to receive money from the system somehow, even if just to cover server costs - his proposal doesn't actually mention anything about that) so it is not clear what they could be charged with, though I'd be highly sceptical of claims that anyone simply operating a node would be above the law. They would of course only be in a position of possibly being charged with something if they got caught - which if they used good enough security they wouldn't. However, the more nodes there are in the system, where the security and anonymity of each node depends on the node owner's own precautions, the more chance there is of some of those nodes being busted - even if this does nothing to affect the marketplace, it won't be too pleasant for the node owners. And with the source code open and available to anyone, I imagine there might be more than a few anonymous marketplace fans who would set up nodes for ideological reasons without any real competence in security, then come to regret it when LE come knocking on their door.  Apologies for the length of this post, I got a little carried away.    TL;DR:  To sum up: -Allowing third-party escrow providers could lead to scamming. -Using users own bitcoin addresses rather than a central mixing service could expose users to security risks if vendors are not especially careful about bitcoin anonymity. If they are careful however it provides greater anonymity than conventional centralised markets because addresses aren't linked to known mixing addresses. -Relying on customers to authorise payments from their own bitcoin addresses will lead to administrative headaches with incorrect payments. -Agreeing and organising an escrow provider could cause additional administrative headaches. -Decentralised hosting across multiple nodes will eliminate the danger of death by single point of failure; if one node goes down, the market lives on. -Having the source code open might expose its vulnerabilities if it is not sound. -Would additionally need to protect against dummy nodes with maliciously modified source code attempting to join the ""market cloud"" (for want of a better term). -The safety of individual node operators would depend on their own security precautions; with open source code, some would inevitably try to run nodes without adequate precautions and could get arrested.    Post-finally, there is one extraneous further thing to note: this guy is doing this on the clearnet as a project on GitHub, which presumably means he won't be involved in the actual implementation. So even if he manages to address all the issues and produces sound, viable source code, it might still fail anyway because no-one is willing to implement it. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","PhantomUlbricht","767","2013-10-16T13:32:32","Decentralized Anonymous Marketplace?","Discussion/Security"," Amazing concept.","DAM (decentralized anonymous marketplace) â the conceptSilk Road has demonstrated that it's possible to run an anonymous online marketplace. While technologically it wasn't that bad, there was a critical point of failure â its centralized nature. Capture administrator and everything is doomed.Here is my proposal of a distributed anonymous marketplace that doesn't have a single point of failure.This concept does not focus on moral issues of participating in a voluntary anonymous trade nor does it endorse a specific use of a system it describes. It is more of a concept of decentralization of current marketplaces.Let us start by looking at some of the problems that centralized marketplaces (like Silk Road) do have and try to figure a solution for them.Internal account balancesOn most of centralized markets, every account got its internal balance. Users deposited money by sending them to DPR's wallets and the system credited the amount to their balance. On transactions between buyers & sellers, just the balances were updated and no actual money transfers took place. Moreover, the users didn't own these Bitcoin wallets so they were never in control.It is, however, a bad idea to rely on a single person and trust all the money to them. Even if they are a good person themselves, there are violent third parties that can try to interrupt the operation any moment and try to seize the money.So, that is a problem. Now. Problem, meet solution.The solution is seemingly obvious. Let the parties transact directly without passing the money through the wallets of 3rd parties that can be compromised.You own your money and don't have to trust anyone with it. Perfect, right?But there is a reason they needed the money to pass through its wallets. It's because there was a need in arbitration. Luckily, there is a way to arbitrate without rising your money to someone...ArbitrationSo, arbitration. It's needed to resolve disputes the buyer and seller might have. Like the item arriving not in time. Or not arriving at all.The way it worked on SR was like this: you buy something, the payment is held in a ""pending"" state, unless you finalize the order. You finalize it if you got your item and you have no concerns about it.If you do, however, you can dispute with the buyer. If you are unable to meet an agreement, the administrator steps in and tries to resolve your conflict. Depending on outcome, the money may be transferred to the seller, refunded to the buyer partially, or refunded to the buyer fully.And that is why it was needed for the money to be held by this trusted third party. Relying on them is, again, a bad idea, and luckily, there is another solution to this problem.The solution is Bitcoin transaction scripts. Without digging into much detail, there is a way to allow mediation of Bitcoin transaction. There is even an example on Bitcoin wiki.Basically, it works this way:    the sender adds a public key of a mediator to the transaction, so that there are 3 people involved in transaction    once transaction is broadcast, it kind of stays in the ""pending"" state unless two of these three cast their vote on transactionThere are three possible outcomes:    the buyer and the seller do agree about the transaction, cast their ""yes""-s and money goes to the seller    the buyer does not agree and asks the mediator to help:        the mediator decides the seller didn't fulfill their part of agreement (e.g. didn't deliver) and casts a ""no"", and so does the buyer, then the transaction is no longer pending and the money is returned to the buyer        the mediator decides the seller did fulfill their part of agreement and casts a ""yes"", and so does the seller, then the transaction is no longer pending and the money reaches the sellerThere are a few benefits to this scheme:    you do not have to trust your money to the mediator. At worst, the money ends up being in seller's/buyer's possession â but definitely not mediator since there is no way the mediator can change the output of transaction    the mediator doesn't have to be an admin or representative of the marketplace. It can be anyone that both the buyer & the seller trustInviting a third party mediator is an interesting idea, as it also removes the dependency on marketplace owner to mediate your dispute... but how would it work?A reputation system. Everyone can be an arbitrator and they get chosen based on their reputation. Which is what the next chapter is about.ReputationA system like Namecoin could be used to maintain identities and reputation of buyers, sellers, mediators, and marketplace owners.Federated distributed marketplacesThere is yet another reason that relying on a single entity is bad. Even if your money always transfers to the buyer directly, and mediation is done by a third party, there is one more thing that isn't distributed â the marketplace itself. If someone arrests or otherwise intimidates the owner, everything goes down. Boom. The money is still yours but the operations had stopped. You can no longer buy or sell.As a solution, something like this might be proposed: marketplace app is OSS and everyone can run their own. And, indeed, it's a good solution. If some marketplace owner gets arrested, the others are still functioning and almost no harm is caused to everyone else.Yet, there is a little thing that makes this approach far from desirable: discoverability, for one thing. You will have to manually discover a variety of marketplaces and signup for all of them. What if there was a better way?..In fact, there is. There is this project called Diaspora. Basically, it's a social network that everyone can run. The key idea is that instead of tens or hundreds of separate social networks that everyone runs, there is one. Everyone can merely run a node that will host its user accounts, posts, and associated data.It also enables for easier discovery. You can subscribe to users from various other nodes, see their posts, and so on. So it's a federated distributed social network.A similar concept can be applied to anonymous marketplaces as well. Everyone can run their own node, and that node will store its users' account data and its own catalog.From the user perspective though, there will be a single unified catalog of various goods. You visit ""Catalog"" and you see items from all federated marketplaces.Wrap upThe solution I propose will allow to get rid of centralization so that there won't be a single point of failure (central authority). The federated distributed marketplace will be much more difficult to shut down. And even in the case of shut down, no one is losing their money.These are basically my thoughts on how such a system could be implemented. It's very likely that I missed something important or didn't fully think it through. All feedback would be highly appreciated.Twitter: @goshakkk"

He reasoned that the server could never be located as it was protected by Tor -- what he didn't count upon what they he could be located, and his communication with the server intercepted, thus revealing its location. There were myself, Guru (and others) who literally pleaded with him to make PGP mandatory, to protect everyone in the event that the server was ever compromised, but he was absolutely unyielding on that point. Ross was far more concerned with philosophical purity, and strict adherence to his Libertarian ideals -- he didn't want to have to force anyone to use PGP if they didn't want to. We've all seen how this worked out -- when the Feds got their hands on the server, they got a literal treasure trove of information -- 80-90% unencrypted -- it was like manna falling from heaven into their laps. If 80-90% had been PGP-encrypted, as opposed to being in the clear, they would have been tearing their hair out in frustration, instead of cracking open the champagne.

When the Feds seized his laptop, it was game over.  When Ross got arrested, you would have thought that Inigo, Libertas and SSBD would have blown, but they didn't.  Obviously, they trusted Ross far, far too much, that he would safeguard their information.  Here on the Forum, a poster by the name of Attila related how he was offered a job by DPR1, the same job that Curtis Green a.k.a. ChronicPain/Flush accepted.  Attila related how, if he had been asked to doxx himself, he would have told DPR to go fuck himself -- I would have done the same. I have long maintained that we haven't even seen the beginning of the fallout from the October bust yet.  I suspect you're right -- the other shoe has yet to drop, and I suspect there will be some real surprises in store.

We need to learn from their mistakes.Always use PGP, always use full disk encryption, never store anything on your hard drive, never use your real IP address to purchase things you will use for illegal purposes, don't fucking import fake IDs from other countries, especially to your home address, don't hire murderers to kill people, etc... Ross made the most mistakes in the book, the other 3 I am assuming fucked up by giving their real IDs to Ross. There is a ton of speculation regarding people from SR 2 being compromised, according to anonymous sources who speak to the mainstream media. But I haven't seen any real evidence, just chatter.

The problem was that DPR1 had no fallback strategy, coupled with inadequate personal operational security. He reasoned that the server could never be located as it was protected by Tor -- what he didn't count upon what they  he could be located, and his communication with the server intercepted, thus revealing its location. There were myself, Guru (and others) who literally pleaded with him to make PGP mandatory, to protect everyone in the event that the server was ever compromised, but he was absolutely unyielding on that point.   Ross was  far more concerned with philosophical purity, and strict adherence to his Libertarian ideals -- he didn't want to have to  force anyone to use PGP if they didn't want to. We've all seen how this worked out -- when the Feds got their hands on the server, they got a literal treasure trove of information -- 80-90% unencrypted -- it was like manna falling from heaven into their laps. If 80-90% had been PGP-encrypted, as opposed to being in the clear, they would have been tearing their hair out in frustration, instead of cracking open the champagne.    What was likely more of a factor was that Ross stored this information insecurely on his laptop. When the Feds seized his laptop, it was game over.  When Ross got arrested, you would have thought that Inigo, Libertas and SSBD would have blown, but they didn't.  Obviously, they trusted Ross far, far too much, that he would safeguard their information.    Here on the Forum, a poster by the name of Attila related how he was offered a job by DPR1, the same job that Curtis Green a.k.a. ChronicPain/Flush accepted.  Attila related how, if he had been asked to doxx himself, he would have told DPR to go fuck himself -- I would have done the same.   I have  long maintained that we haven't even seen the beginning of the fallout from the October bust yet.  I suspect you're right -- the other shoe has yet to drop, and I suspect there will be some real surprises in store.

Among the notable findings:      62 percent of the SWAT raids surveyed were to conduct searches for drugs.     Just under 80 percent were to serve a search warrant, meaning eight in 10 SWAT raids were not initiated to apprehend a school shooter, hostage taker, or escaped felon (the common justification for these tactics), but to investigate someone still only suspected of committing a crime.     In fact, just 7 percent of SWAT raids were âfor hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios.â     In at least 36 percent of the SWAT raids studies, no contraband of any kind was found. The report notes that due to incomplete police reports on these raids this figure could be as high as 65 percent.     SWAT tactics are disproportionately used on people of color.     65 percent of SWAT deployments resulted in some sort of forced entry into a private home, by way of a battering ram, boot, or some sort of explosive device. In over half those raids, the police failed to find any sort of weapon, the presence of which was cited as the reason for the violent tactics.     Ironically (or perhaps not), searches to serve warrants on people suspected of drug crimes were more likely to result in forced entry than raids conducted for other purposes.     Though often justified for rare incidents like school shootings or terrorist situations, the armored personnel vehicles police departments are getting from the Pentagon and through grants from the Department of Homeland Security are commonly used on drug raids.  since 9/11 swat raids have gone up to nearly 24,000 raids conducted most of which are deemed unnecessary almost ALL swat raids are conducted for drugs in which the residents are actually considered non violent but are treated as though they are vicious individuals.   on average in the United States there are now over 115 raids conducted DAILY and are completely overlooked by the justice system.   The ACLU has also conducted investigations into militarization of police forces buying armored cars used EXCLUSIVELY for drug raids.  Piggy backing on the back of dead children shot by psychopaths in schools or ""terrorist threats"", they claim they are necessary to conduct sweeps of ""sectors"" (notice how they dont call them neighborhoods).  These APC's are mine resistant RPG resistant tanks.  This isnt for raiding houses kids, this is for take over, and command and control.   For those in the US get ready for something big. stay safe yall.",""

A ROM, such as the one you're using, is a distribution of the Android layer that includes custom software and modifications.  Yes, Android is unsafe because of this ""Android"" layer that's running on top of the Linux kernel.  Google ultimately is the one in control of your phone.  They can push software -- any software -- to your phone at will.  If you have the Google Play market installed, this is the case.  Without it, you cannot use any of the cool software that makes Android worth having.  Part of what the Play Market does is provide an interface to apps and a support library that takes care of a lot of the generic, universal stuff that most or all apps need to do.  So most apps use some piece of that, and if it isn't there, the apps don't work so well (if at all).

It seems like it would be a good idea. Much like how SR employs people to hack the road to try and find holes that could allow somebody to get in if they find such holes, and fuck shit up.  At least if there were a group of pro-tor people who would hack away and try to find ways to do things to hurt others by deanonymising them, hacking them, hacking their SR accounts ect instead of some german fuck hackers who are threatening to hack tor with a $3,000 budget. They should be saying ""Hey, we are hacking tor with a 3k budget, but dont worry, were going to tell you how we did it so you can better secure the network""  Is there any way this could be set up? I dont know how these things work. But I assume maybe those behind the Torproject already might do this. But if there are groups of people threatening to hack us with a 3k budget why cant we have a group of people who are trying to do good by protecting the tor users. They can have fun hacking and attacking the tor network till they find something suspicious that they COULD use to do bad things to people, but instead, they report their findings to the heads of the tor project so they can fix these security issues.  I think of it this way. Why cant Tor leaders employ a group of trusted specialized hackers to find these holes and security risks before any other hackers do whom would use them against us.  I'm pretty sure this is done at silk road. I think i read something about how SR employs people to try and attack the road to find voulnerable entry points that they can use to get in, and just fuck shit up.  But if german hackers claim they can hack the tor network with 3k, why can somebody/people be out there trying to find these security risks, and fix them before any other hackers who want to cause trouble can?

FYI, I'm not crazy about Electrum's anonymity personally, because even though you can set it up to use a proxy it still appears to sometimes connect outside of Tor, and when I ran my electrum wallet through Tor, Tor raised a warning that the app was doing something that might compromise anonymity.  I'd stick with the full clients like Bitcoin-QT or Armory.","The current wallet I have is downloaded on my ""for whatever"" laptop.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","26667","2014-02-16T22:26:04","tor with safe-mail question","Discussion/Security"," Safe-Mail works fine with Tor, what you have to do is select the Fast (No scripts or icons) from the interface dropdown. when you are logging-in. For best results, you also need to turn off IP address checking.  When your IP address changes, you'll be prompted with instructions on how to turn off IP address checking.   Personally, I don't recommend Safe-Mail, as it is a clearnet provider, meaning that the Feds can subpoena information from them about any user. The fact that they're in Israel seems to make no difference -- it would appear they honor American subpoenas or search warrants.  In my view, you're far better off with Mailtor: http://mailtoralnhyol5v.onion/  Nightcrawler 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler <Nightcrawler@SR> PGP Key Fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B  Security is a bit like religion... some things have to be taken on faith.  Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.

The bug allows anybody connecting to a vulnerable service to reveal the contents of memory on the server - and thus reveal secret keys, user information, passwords, identity, etc.  There is more information about the bug and the versions of OpenSSL that are affected at the website setup for the bug:  http://heartbleed.com/  Ðilk Road is a hidden service hosted through the Tor network, and while our site is not affected by this OpenSSL vulnerability. the Tor software that makes up the network was affected by this bug in some instances since it integrates the OpenSSL library.

While most congressman in BOTH parties are ""progressives"" (authoritarian) nowadays, the GOP is generally the lesser evil in most cases, although only slightly.

Unfortunately for the vast majority of congressman, this left/right business is pretty much negligable as they are almost ALL big government nowadays.  The only exeption is Libertarian conservatives (Tea Party-ish). Ex: Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz. These Libert conservs are the ONLY congressman that will fight and fight for much lower fed power/size, exec power/size, taxes/spending, ridiculous regulations and laws, and dissolving the War on Drugs.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","fakename709","345","2013-10-11T13:27:36","command line gpg - easier than shit","Discussion/Security","taken from the original SR forums, the whole message doesn't appear under quotation for better reading but the reference is at the top. link to original thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42031.0  All shell commands will be in code tags. Output from GPG to the terminal will be in quote tags. My comments are simply text.  To use GPG  you need to generate a key pair. This consists of a public key and a private key. It is safe to give the public key to anyone who you correspond with, the private key should not be shared with anyone else. You can think of the public key as being an open lock, which you give to the people who you want to be able to communicate securely with you. You can image it as the people you have shared your open lock (public key) with putting their messages to you in a secure box and locking it shut by closing your open lock on it. Now even they can not open the lock. You keep the private key yourself, in a combination safe. The combination to the safe is your passphrase. After providing your passphrase, the combination safe is opened and the private key is used to unlock you closed lock and take the message out. GPG doesn't actually require that you understand much of this, simply that you know the basics of public and private keys.   Let's generate a key pair from the command line:   gpg --gen-key you will be presented with a series of questions regarding the key you are generating   This is simply asking you which encryption algorithms you would like to use for session key encryption and signature. It doesn't particularly matter the selection you make as all of the options are secure, however you will want to select either option one or two as three and four are used for signatures only. I will go with the default of RSA and RSA, so I enter 1 and press enter.    1 Now you will be asked the strength you would like to make the keys.   Generally you will want to go with the strongest possible choice, 1,024 bit keys are currently considered to be somewhat secure but they are probably crackable by agencies such as NSA and will not be secure against less powerful attackers for very long. I will select 4,096, which should remain secure for quite a long time.   4096 Now you will be asked how long the key should remain valid for   Chances are that you want your key to always be recognized as valid by the people you communicate with. I always put 0 here, as I have thus far never desired a key that expires.   0   y Now you will be asked the name and email address characteristics you would like associated with the key    For real name you should absolutely put the same thing as the pseudonym you use the key for. Failure to do this will result in pissed off vendors and may very well end up with you being ignored, as nobody wants to spend the time required to figure out which key belongs to you.   kmfkewm  For email address you can either put a legitimate (anonymous) email address that you can be reached at, or something made up. I generally make something up, although using a real email address is a good way to keep in touch in case your regular channel of communication is ever compromised.    kmfkewm@silkroad.onion You will be asked for any additional comment that you would like to be associated with your key     the email address is fake  now you will be presented with the choices you have selected and given a chance to change them if you desire to do so.   I am happy with all of this so I will select O.    O   Additionally, a GUI input box may pop up. You will need to enter your passphrase twice. Your passphrase should, at a bare minimum, be longer than eight characters. ideally, it will be an entire random sentence consisting of multiple words with out care being taken for grammatical correctness or making sense.   At this point it is wise to randomly type on your keyboard into the terminal to help speed up the entropy gathering process. This is especially important if you are in a virtual machine, as there is not a mechanical hard drive to be used a source of randomness. During the process of gathering entropy, mathematic symbols are printed to the screen, seemingly for your amusement.   Eventually your key will be generated, as signaled by something like this  note: this doesn't match the key I actually generated because my terminal fucked up. This doesn't usually happen  .   Now that you have generated your keys, you need to be able to get your public key to give to the people who you would like to be able to securely communicate with you. Remember, you use peoples public keys to encrypt messages to them, and they use your public key to encrypt messages to you. Private keys are used in the message decryption process.  let's export the public key     gpg -a --export kmfkewm@silkroad.onion  -a signals that the output is ascii armored and --export is the flag to export a public key. You need to make sure to specify the e-mail address of the public key you would like to export or else it will export all of your public keys as one huge ascii armor block. I believe it is also possible to do it by username, however it seems to easily be confused, as when I specified it export kmfkewm it was exporting my real key which has the username of KmfkeWm, but when I specify by email address it works as expected.    When people want you to be able to send them encrypted messages they will send you a copy of their public keys and you will need to import them. This is an easy process, feel free to test it with the key I have listed above. First, copy the key so that it is in your clipboard.    gpg --import now paste the key to the terminal.     ctrl d   note: ctrl represents the ctrl key, you do not type it in.  Now that people have your public key, they are able to encrypt messages to you. Also, now that you have their public key, you can encrypt messages to them. Let's encrypt a message, in this case I will simply encrypt the message to myself.    gpg -e -a   Allegedly you can specify users by username, however the same issue with kMfkeWm vs kmfkewm seems to be present, so it is best to select users by their e-mail address. Alternatively, you can select them by their full user ID. Let's take a moment to side track the current train of thought to show how to get a list of the full user ID's of people whose public keys you have:   gpg --list-keys   The UID consists of everything after UID up to and including the closing >  so let's get back to encrypting messages. Since it asked my for the UID of the recipient I wish to encrypt the message to....   kmfkewm (the email address is fake) <kmfkewm@silkroad.onion>  At this point I could select to encrypt the message for multiple recipients, however I do not desire to do this so I simply hit the enter key with a blank line to signal that I have selected all desired recipients. Now type your message in   test   ctrl d  This is the ciphertext, and it has been encrypted to my key. Of course, it will be encrypted for whoever you selected when you entered a UID.   Sometimes you will get encrypted messages and need to decrypt them. Since I just encrypted a message to myself I will now go through the process of decrypting it.     gpg -d You are presented with a blank line. Simply paste the ciphertext that you wish to decrypt   you will likely be automatically prompted for your password at this point, possibly in the terminal or possibly in a pop up GUI input box. Enter your password. To view the decrypted message you may have to hit ctrl d    ctrl d     That sums up the basic commands required to use GPG from the command line. Of course you can do a lot more with GPG, symmetric encryption, hashing, file encryption, signatures and validation, etc, but I am not going to cover all of those unless people specifically request that I do. I hope that this shows that using GPG from the command line is trivial and that using GPG in general is trivial. I believe that this tutorial is fully cross platform. You do not need any fancy GUI or OS specific bullshit to make full use of GPG, and in fact I find that controlling it entirely from the command line is far less of a hassle. It is also far more secure as now an attacker sending you malicious ciphertexts can only hope to exploit a vulnerability in the core GPG engine, instead of the GUI package or wrapper you are using for GPG.",";Please select what kind of key you want:   (1) RSA and RSA (default)   (2) DSA and Elgamal   (3) DSA (sign only)   (4) RSA (sign only)Your selection? ;RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.What keysize do you want?

The most recent one that I read on this board, however, suggested it doesn't necessarily help, so I'm not sure if it's worth taking the time to learn more about it. When I say that I read it may not be of help, the post that I read specifically was describing an attack in which the attacker roots your machine (I'm not sure what the probability of that happening is -- my root password and my HDD encryption passwords are both very strong and are entirely different).  Any advice?   Embarrassingly, security is my Achilles heel. I'm in a VM with Linux as both the host and guest OSs; I don't allow shared clipboards or folders; and I never run as root in either the host or the guest, but I know those things alone aren't much protection. I've learned a lot in the last two years, but obviously not enough.  I doubt that I'd be an LE prime target, but you never know. I don't want to be low-hanging fruit for LE to cherry pick. I'd also like to beef up my security regardless of whether I'm at risk, if for no other reason than to have more privacy.  Also, should I be worried about my modem's MAC since it's registered with my ISP? My understanding is that routers can leak unencrypted MAC addresses (please correct me if this is wrong or misguided).  Forgive me if these are stupid questions. And thanks in advance for your advice!",""

There is a legitimate reason to spoof your MAC on any network, even your home network. If, by some shitty stroke of luck, some LEA happens to run code on your machine, they could send your MAC back to their servers and identify your machine definitively. And im sure that sounds far fetched but when freedom hosting went down, LE injected code into the webpages it was serving up that exploited a hole in TBB, got outside firefox, executed shell code, and sent an IP and MAC to whatever LEA is responsible for that.   MAC spoofing is definitely helpful against that sort of attack. Whether or not you feel you're going to be the target of something that sophisticated is another matter. As far as I'm concerned, anything is possible. ",""

On a public Wifi?  Yes, spoof it.   Why leave the whole fingerprint of exactly who was at that Wifi network when you don't have to?    On somebody else's Wifi?  Hell, I'd spoof it.  Again, why leave fingerprints?  At home, on Wifi?  Your call.  I can totally make the ""Why bother?"" argument, and I can also make the ""Why not just spoof it?"" argument.  If you're concerned that somebody is sniffing your Wifi, then I suppose it would keep them from seeing your real hardware MAC address.

I doubt that scenario is likely, but I was curious what others thought of it since it wasn't something I'd ever considered. And obviously, I need all the security help I can get. Thanks for your advice.  PS I'm not as confident as others in the idea of plausible deniability.","It depends.   I'm making broad statements here, somebody will have good reasons why each is wrong in some scenario.  But generally:Spoof the MAC of your cable modem?  I wouldn't bother, your cable provider already knows who you are, it kinda cramps the anonymous deniability aspect."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","2311","2013-11-07T12:15:23","Should I be spoofing my MAC address?","Discussion/Security","That's a good point.. that layer can't hurt, in case they decide to just get your MAC address from the ifconfig in the exploit instead of from BIOS query that'll show your real MAC.  Once somebody pwns your box, your real MAC is still queriable regardless of whatever you've spoof it to.   Only decent way around that problem is to use a manufacturer firmware reset tool to change the MAC on the physical device.  And that's hit-or-miss, depending on vendor. ","Whom got most of it right. Theres just one thing to add. There is a legitimate reason to spoof your MAC on any network, even your home network. If, by some shitty stroke of luck, some LEA happens to run code on your machine, they could send your MAC back to their servers and identify your machine definitively. And im sure that sounds far fetched but when freedom hosting went down, LE injected code into the webpages it was serving up that exploited a hole in TBB, got outside firefox, executed shell code, and sent an IP and MAC to whatever LEA is responsible for that. MAC spoofing is definitely helpful against that sort of attack. Whether or not you feel you're going to be the target of something that sophisticated is another matter. As far as I'm concerned, anything is possible."

I haven't made any purchases using this connection method, but i have logged into the same account i've used in the past to check on things.  Does this one flaw in my security mean my whole setup is basically compromised and i ideally need to start fresh with everything?  I don't really want to throw my phone away, it's not cheap! But i guess if i did i would also have to change my number?  I asked a question similar to this one some time back on the old forum but got no real answers so i didn't worry about following it up any further.  Guess i should have stuck to my original setup with tails and wifi, but it wasn't very convenient.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Hijinx","44599","2014-06-26T00:03:35","Random Pro Tip on Seized encrypted data","Discussion/Security","I just read an article talking about 5th amendment rights when it comes to crypto.  A dude was commiting bank (spelling edit, lol) fraud, and it was found that his 5th amendment rights werent compromised when he was forced to decrypt his computers. The linch pin for this ruling was that he had admitted that the computers were his, and that he had the encryption keys to them.  Another case found that a mans 5th amendment rights protect him from decrypting his computer. However, he hadn't admitted that he knew how to decrypt his files. Seems like a small, hardly noticable difference, but one dude is in jail, and the other is free...  Lesson: Don't admit that the computer is yours, or that you know how to decrypt it. (I'll do ya one better: Don't talk to piggies.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- from http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/25/us-usa-cybercrime-massachusetts-iduskbn0f02j920140625?irpc=932 (clearnet)   Police can order an accused criminal to decrypt his computer without violating his constitutional right against self-incrimination, Massachusetts' top court said on Wednesday.  In the latest U.S. ruling on the contentious issue, the 5-2 ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reverses a lower courtâs finding that police could not force Leon Gelfgatt, charged with mortgage fraud, to decrypt four computers seized in an investigation, since doing so would violate his Fifth Amendment right.  The court found that since Gelfgatt had told investigators that the computer belonged to him and that he had the encryption key, police could compel him to decrypt his files.    âThe Commonwealth's motion to compel decryption does not violate the defendant's rights under the Fifth Amendment because the defendant is only telling the government what it already knows,â according to the courtâs opinion.  Gelfgatt, an attorney in Marblehead, Mass., about 18 miles (28 km) north of Boston, was indicted in 2010 for allegedly concocting a âsophisticated schemeâ to reap $13 million through mortgage fraud, according to court documents.  State troopers seized four computers in the investigation, all of which were protected by encryption software that Gelfgatt refused to remove, saying âthey essentially were asking for the defendant's help in putting him in jail,â according to court documents.    In its decision, the high court did not specify if Gelfgatt would be compelled to decrypt his computers had he not made statements about owning the computer and having the key. That suggests that the case is unlikely to set a precedent for future cases, said Jessie Rossman, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts, which submitted a brief in support of Gelfgatt.  âThe majorityâs opinion was very much linked to the fact of this case,â Rossman told Reuters.    Stanley Helinski, a lawyer for Gelfgatt, said there is a lack of consensus among U.S. courts on whether compelling defendants to provide access by decrypting files effectively forces them to give prosecutors evidence against them.     âIf you're asking the defendant to go into his brain and access the information, then you're violating his Fifth Amendment rights,â Helinski said.     In February 2012, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled that a defendant did not have to decrypt his hard drive, since doing so would violate his Fifth Amendment rights. But a federal judge in Wisconsin last spring ordered a Missouri man to decrypt his files, after he admitted that he owned the computer and had the key. ",""

Then am i being detained, if so what for, and am i under arrest, whats the charge? Then when they see your not giving in they threatn and try to scare you by intimidation tactics. Also state that if your not under arrest you would like to leave, say it a couple times, because this staement makes it clear you do not wish to be infringed upon, which is a direct Violation of your 4th amendment rights, i think, but its a law in us code title 18 statuete 242, no its been a while so i could be slighty off please research so you know exactly your rights. This title 18 is detailed }info on any person acting under the color of law{ and it explains your rights to not be bothered by police or any agency whatsoever, which if they violate this law and you have say a nice pocket cam recording the encounter, you are golden even if you get arrested, because you will have them in court no matter what with a jury.     See they cannot detain you unless you are breaking the law. They are trained to circumvent the constitution, by lying,fear tactics,threats and trickery. They cannot take what you do not give them. Also try to have a friend or girl or person you trust to start recording any type of police interaction, also have secret small camera they never know about that is also recording in case they steal your phone or friends phone. Car cameras on dash and under dash are great. Also the supreme court stated in a ruling not too long agao that a citizen who is observing the 5th amendment Must Clearly State They are observing their 5th amendment right not to answer any quesrtions. Look on youtube on clearnet one day and see folks using these same rights to avoid being harassed by illegal roadblocks and illegal checkpoints.    You keep your car doors locked, at all times, they cannot force you to leave or take a test or answer any questions about where your going or wher your from, roll down window tiny bit and give drivers liscens e if you choose, Then state your observing your 5th amendement right to not answer any questions, then answer no questions what so ever and do not get out of your car, please also make sure your recording in case they violate your civil rights and try to deny it in their report.

If you're a kingpin then you may need some extra security like this. For the rest of us a 4096 bit key with a strong passphrase is enough. That assumes you keep your mouth shut if you're ever arrested. NEVER taunt the po-po that you have something encrypted and they'll never be able to crack it. Because you might be ordered to divulge your passphrase if you've admitted that you're hiding evidence. One judge did exactly that to a smartass prick lawyer. Don't be that guy!     ",""

And also how badly they want to nail you. If your passphrase is long enough then you'll be fine. I'd say a length of at least 25 characters will do it. 50 characters is much better but being able to actually remember your passphrase is most important     Diceware is probably the best method. You randomly get 8+ words rolling dice and then you can add a couple of numbers and symbols here and there to salt the passphrase. That's unbreakable no matter what the government throws at it.  ","If you had a shitty password on a private PGP key and someone got a hold of it wouldn't someone just be able to brute force it? For instance you are arrested and LE finds your tails USB and your USB with the private key and they want to decrypt some messages they intercepted, they could just brute force it and if the password was shitty, it would be done fairly quickly (right?)"

In the criminal complaint (which, if you're curious, you can read here: http://www.justice.gov/dea/divisions/mia/2013/mia112113.pdf), it says they caught her because she (stupidly) used her real name/sent everything from her USPS account with her credit card and shit. She had good feedback on SR and the forums, so I didn't suspect anything... I guess I should have seen the ""md"" in her name and that she offered medical advice as a listing, but alas...  The complaint says 368 packages were sent between June and August 2013. One of the international packages was able to be intercepted, so I assume the feds have all of the buyer's addresses... It's entirely possible that I either bought from her in March, which would hopefully mean they don't have shit on me... Or I bought from her in July. I can't remember, I just know two packages arrived each time I was out of town, and I was traveling in both those months...   Anyway, assuming they do know something was sent to me, how worried should I be? For what it's worth, I actually made a successful order on BMR a few weeks or so ago before I found out she got busted -- it went very smoothly.

When they realised that another SR would pop up, they obviously knew that the next one would be harder to take down as there would be more security precautions taken, and the new DPR could learn from the old one's mistakes.  So, if they created a crazy fluctuation in market prices and then somehow burst the bubble, vendors could potentially be put out of business due to losing so much money that they couldn't afford to restock. Perhaps, it is another way of putting SR out of business. Imagine if this bubble burst and the bitcoin went back down to â¬70, for example. That would be a catastrophic hit for any vendor that couldn't afford to sit on their bitcoins until they appreciated in value again.  I myself am holding off on making sales until the bitcoin value stabilises. I won't be holding my breath for that any time soon though, as I am convinced it has something to do with the FBI.  Again, this is just my opinion on what may be happening, so please don't take it as gospel.",""

In other words, we need cops. A necessary evil, if you will. The laws they're told to enforce are what you have a problem with. Think about why those laws are there?  Somebody somewhere, maybe a neighbor of yours, maybe even a family member, had something to say, and it ended with ""There ought to be a law against this sort of thing"" - Or , ""Why aren't they enforcing the law"".   We all have the power to put people in power, but we have a responsibility to make sure they're administering the law without corruption.  Nobody wants to get involved in their local governments. It's boring. You want to watch some game on TV where grown men play with their balls.   That's what your OWNERS are counting on! - Your lack of interest in public affairs. -   You go out in public, don't you? - Well don't you think you should have a say in what the police do as far as harassing some white boys who are just visiting the ghetto for some ""feel good tonic""?   I'm as guilty as you. I'm noticing an increasing number of police behaving badly, and was wondering why? Then it occurred to me. Who makes the laws, who puts them in power, etc.   MY point is, that if you don't get involved and at least try to make things better, we'll keep going towards a police state. And if you don't get involved you really don't have a right to bitch about it. ",""

This is a weak link in the chain of anonymity.  Switching to Electrum on a trucrypt encrypted volume with the Tor proxy set up was a better solution for me. Also electrum has some nice recovery features and the ability to store your bitcoins completely offline yet still spend them without a transfer or connection to the computer my wallet is stored on.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","9574","2013-12-18T18:47:44","tails and pgp question","Discussion/Security","Generating a new public key every time you reboot Tails is very impractical. You would want to save your keys somewhere, so that you can retrieve them when you boot up and need to use them. Persistence is your best option for saving and storing keys, but if you cannot get it going, there are work-arounds.  If you are not using persistence in Tails,  you will need to re-import the saved keys into your key manager app every time you boot up. I would recommend storing your keys on a dedicated encrypted USB stick. You don't  have to encrypt the USB stick, an unencrypted one will work too. Encryption will just protect you, should your data fall into the wrong hands.   The Tails disk utility will let you encrypt a drive (Applications>System Tools>Disk Utility). You might also want to look into TrueCrypt for encrypting files/drives. ",""

Historically, all USB sticks said they were removable, even if this is not correct according to the specification (removable is rather for devices that can be fed with removable medium, such as a floppy drive). Recently, quite a lot of new USB sticks (especially Sandisk) expose themselves as non-removable.A draft preliminary plan could be:    1.  Have Tails Installer write down the UUID in boot loader config on initial install    2.  Have Tails Installer preserve the UUID in boot loader config on upgrade    3.  Have Tails Updater (IUK) preserve the UUID in boot loader config on upgrade    4.  Require booting from the UUID that is in boot loader config, that is add such an option to live-boot    5.  Stop requiring the removable flag at boot time    6.  Only allow using persistent volume from the boot medium, that is add such an option to live-persist and/or live-boot"
