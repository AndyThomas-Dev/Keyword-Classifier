I never had any tutoring from you and you're no mastermind that invented fire. However, this negative and childish behavior of you might be the reason why all students have been coming to me instead of you lately. It's not just that my price is cheaper, but in a cheap attempt to talk me down you actually confirm your students I am tutoring the stuff you're charging 3x as much for. I do not claim such things. You are the reason they come to me and for that, I thank you. :-)",alphawolf89 wrote: Good luck with sales thief.

Best value for your buck  , you will make your investment back fast.

Evolution Forums,RuffLess,31110,2014-12-16T02:24:59,Re: CONvenient Live Tutoring [Skrill/Paypal/Venmo/Auto-/Virtual Carding],Guides Vendors,Skrill you say. I am always open to looking into something new. From what I know about skrill when you add a CC to the account there is verification deposits. You will need simple fullz but then again skrill has no chargeback once transfers to another skrill account. May look into this to add to my daily BTC funnel. anyone had good experiance with the skrill? Any burn potential? let me know RuffLess,

First of he is VERY friendly and in the beginning he started to ask you questions just to see your previous experience with carding, if any...Personally this was great as I've been working with Paypal for 2 years ago, before all the errors occured.. This guy saved me alot of trial & error..  When the tutoring session started he described both for digital and physical goods which was great also how to work with hacked accounts and what to think about and so much beyond that. I give this guy 20 stars out of 10, as he still offers you help even after the session is over, whenever I need him.A true carding-friend for a very long time I hope!",

Evolution Forums,siamesecat,31110,2014-12-24T15:52:12,Re: CONvenient Live Tutoring [Skrill/Paypal/Venmo/Auto-/Virtual Carding],Guides Vendors,"4 years ago, I attended a class that starting by all attendees were asked to folded a boat origami.  I was thinking WHAT!¦ we are not kid anymore. Sighh¦ Anyway we all dont know how to fold a crappy origami at that time. A trainer seems to know the situation. Does anyone here think you are able to fold an origami by just reading the text and image instruction? he asked.Some of them rest their hands.Does anyone here think you are able to fold an origami by just listening to the instruction? he asked again.A few of them rest their hands.Does anyone here think you are able to fold an origami by just following me step by step? he asked the rest of all.Couple dude and me raised our hands. 3 min later. I was founded that our group already finished folding an origami while some people got stuck in the first or second step and cannot go further. This is the reason why I prefer live session more than a reading material.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Guys, take a look at my skills checklist before I place an order.  [x] Never carded  before. I know the definition but absolutely no idea how to do that.  [x] Skrill ?  Never use their service but I see they are like Paypal. I use Paypal, so It could be easy.  [x] Spend all day reading every topics on Evo. Pretending that I could be a pro someday.  How about you, guys?  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ What happened after I placed an order? 5 MINUTE. Conv added me and ask if i am ready, Conv is already to give a live session without problems.Maybe I have a lucky day that Conv is online at the same time I purchased.  I asked Conv to wait for me about 30 minute. Conv is ok with my request even his time is 6am.  ZZzZz We went trough each steps and stop at the end of each one asked for any hesitation.All the step I learned are not difficult to follow. In the session, you will be given some gifts that Conv did not mention in the sale page.  Actually, Conv can ask me to pay an extra because I ask him to teach something that not including in the list but he teach me for free. You all should know that if Conv want to sell add-on stuffs to me, I will buy without doubt but look how good Conv is. Conv shows me how to obtain that stuff without buying from Convs store list. Not every people did that to me.  I think all these information will be help you guys make a final decision. I  still dont have time to use this method yet. I just writing about what I learnt from the session. I will be back to write the ROI about this Skrill class. Stay tuned. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",

Maybe also do as if you are retrieving the parcel and walk out with something that looks like a parcel to fool observers.  If they catch you, you have no plausible deniability and will also be charged with fraud (in some cases the fraud charge is worse).",

LadroN+ v1.3 WordPress Plug-in | Automated CVV cashout For those of you running your own merchants or those of you who are thinking about running your own merchants, this is the listing to end all listings.  One contact, one purchase, gives you everything you need to start churning CVVs directly into your bank account. LadroN+ integrates seamlessly into WordPress, allowing you to automate transactions against the Stripe.com API.   ª Automate transactions as a single sale or a recurring subscription service on a weekly / monthly / yearly schedule.ª Easily import 1000s of CVVs at once using the same format exported from most popular autoshops. ª Each package includes full LadroN+ documentation.  As always, post sales support is provided free of charge.   --- FULL PACKAGE: /documents[NEW] The Four Horsemen - The eCommerce Fraud Method Bank applicationsUSPS formsExcel calculators  /softwareLadroN+ v1.3 WordPress Plug-in [US CVV data only]LadroN+ v1.3 Quick Start manual and installation guide  /miscellaneous 10 Premium WooCommerce Themes25 Premium WordPress Plug-ins including paid payment gateways 489 USD http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/14863 ----MonkeyBusiness, an Evolution Market exclusivehttp://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/store/2757

Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-05-03T15:05:42,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"No, it's fine.  Relax. A node is a single web store that has four separate functions over the course of its life.  The method creates and manages nodes on a revolving schedule.  We begin each project with automation in mind so we should really only build a web store, or node, once and then customize and copy it. The biggest administrative tasks for this method should be managing Stripe accounts and creating products / bells & whistles to keep your eCommerce site fresh and relevant.  Everything is driven by WordPress and is extremely user friendly.     LadroN+ is not the primary revenue generator until much later in the process and then it's entirely optional if you even decide to use it.   Thanks

I can't say for sure because I only know what worked for me when I was in South America but I don't think you'd have a problem if you have access to an American willing to make a visit to the US Consulate.   There are many many other options available for non-US citizens to secure the components we need but if you had access to an American that was really willing to just walk in and smile and sign a paper you would have near full control and wouldn't have to rely on anyone.  That would be best case scenario but it's easily worked through with items available on Evolution.

Evolution Forums,First,8880,2014-05-09T22:04:07,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"Finished reading the guide, I haven't put it into effect yet but heres my take.  1. The guide is one of the most professionally put together ones I've seen on Evo Moka goes into great detail of every aspect of what he is teaching you. You should, have no questions to ask after a full read-through so save them until you're done fully reading.  2. Moka provides bank applications and all forms you'll need inside the guide and a easy way to get needed scans instantly. You won't be scouring or doing any googling to find the resources you'll need.  3. This guide will work as designed I'm sure, and is basically teaching you how to fully utilize Landron 100%.  4. It's from Moka.   5. I can't think of any cons, pricing is on point for what you're buying as it includes landron as well. Moka may have written this as a marketing stradgey to increase sales of Landron, and it works. You won't regret you're purchase.  6. I haven't started Landron or setting it up yet, but I will be soon in the next few days. It seems difficult at first, but once you read through it seems really easy. Hopefully everything works as Moka says.   Regards",

Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-05-11T14:57:14,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"You should use a US VPN when opening Stripe accounts otherwise you risk being grouped in with Beta customers and will not be eligible for a 2 day payout. I've said in another thread that Stripe has the option to force override the CVC check and approve the transaction but I don't suggest it for a lot of reasons.  It's meant for very small purchases.  Low quality data doesn't fit in our operation because you are limited in what you can really do with it.  This is a long term thing.   You should seek high quality CVV data.  I like random US mix, no AmEx.  Start with 50 then work up to 300 - 500 and go up from there.  We don't use traditional retail banking like WF or Chase or even Ally.  I actively suggest against using Ally because you'll risk getting the account frozen using it with merchant accounts.  You should be able to secure the cards you need off Evo but I also provide a way to secure them on your own.  It shouldn't be that much of an obstacle so don't worry about it.  I can point you in the direction of my preferred vendors.    Thanks",

My advice to you is to start with the CVV to PayPal guide and read up on WordPress before spending your money on the full package.   Thanks","capone wrote:Hi moka, I have few questions for u I'm a total newbie about payments system, is your guide can be read for a newbie like me (is it newbie friendly ?) ?

From what I've gathered Stripe will need your company registration number and your VAT number.

Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-07-18T12:37:53,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"I should also add that VM is definitely the most popular autoshop, regardless of what anyone says.  The Ladron parser uses the same format exported from Vault Market due to this.  Many people shit on them but if you have good search criteria and have an idea of what you want then you should do ok.  VM is not a place to scrape the bottom.

The only problem I would face is getting a consistent supply of US bank accounts without the need to set up dozens of drops in my area. Would be a pain in the ass. Like Yasuo, I don't like doing anything physical. But I'm sure I'd figure this out somehow, perhaps there are some tips included for this in your guide as well.I'm so pumped for this, I wanna start doing it right now, because due to my previous experience with web administration, I'm sure I would make this work perfectly.However, I'll first have to slave away at my 9 to 5 job to save up the cash for the guide and all the needed resources, fuck my life haha",

Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-07-21T13:27:15,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"@ caffeine -- We could go back and forth about this.  Everyone has the idea that they are bad, which is somewhat true, but I like to think there are different levels of quality with the prepaids.  NetSpend, ReadyDebit Gold, AccountNow, NetBank, have all received deposits of at least 2,500 USD with no problems whatsoever.   There was an issue with an AccountNow card that didn't have the plastic registered but that's it.  I don't want to post details out in the open but that kind of problem would be your fault anyway, not from either bank or Stripe. @ Trippy -- You are going to have a difficult time if you are not familiar with WordPress.  I tried to make things as accessible as possible but this package really benefits people who have experience with web development or have an existing web store and are struggling with traffic.  Look at Michaelis.   You're not buying CVVs to abuse.  Your company doesn't have a marketing budget so you need to buy your customers, get it?

No more petty cvv cashouts or paypal scams, this will END your search for moneymaking. I promise you.  I love this. Also, Moka provided me a HUGE bonus  Didn't expect that at all.

Some accounts are 2-day, some are 7-day. Does this mean the Fullz I used are bad or something, or is this just a random thing?",
Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-08-08T11:56:18,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"It's random as far as I know.  If they were doing any sort of preliminary credit checks you would see the legal language somewhere before we activate the account.  Since the beginning of the year Stripe has been in a constant state of change.  They went from 2 day to 7 day to 2 day then back to 7 day, then 2 day for everyone, then 2 day for US only and back again, etc. It is now August and we see the boilerplate 'account closed' messages with no activity on the account whatsoever, using paid Premium Shopify services.  It's maddening. Their customer support is non-existent.  Try to find 5 good reviews on Google.  They have no phone number.  The are no pre-sales channels.  If I was a legitimate business owner I would not deal with a company half as bad as Stripe.  They tell high volume customers they can contact the company through a freenode IRC channel.  An.  IRC.  Channel.   I have a theory that a lot of these half assed payment processors are doing some financial acrobatics to appear much more valuable than they really are in an attempt to shop around for VC money --  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-09/stripe-said-to-get-funding-valuing-online-payment-startup-at-100-million.html The point I'm desperately trying to make is that you need to think of Stripe and LadroN+ only in the context of what has been proven to be successful and do your research.  Look at other companies and look at your options instead of doing the same things every month.  I stopped doing the turn key packages for a reason.   WePay is one to look into.  You get your API keys the moment you sign up and verification is nearly identical to Stripe.  We never hear that name mentioned, though.   I think if you guys tried balancing your time between wrestling with Stripe and researching other processors you would find success much faster.    Sorry for the wall of text but this is prime real estate at the top of page 11.

Evolution Forums,dobit,8880,2014-08-08T19:36:04,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,Moka you're spreading the WePay love!  I got onto them after experiencing them on youcaring.org.  I couldn't agree more with you about spending your time researching other payment processors and also about how stripe are trying to inflate their value. Try and find a single positive review from someone who is using their service legitimately... Anyway another free bump from me!,
Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-08-08T20:45:54,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"I don't think so.  We are not actively exploiting anything it's just that Stripe's service is very poor so we can't rely on ""traditional"" methods like SEing sales people and devs, etc.  In my opinion it's a numbers game at this point and probably will be until the end of the year.  We're not going to see any major changes in the last quarter.  I would be really surprised if we did.    Regardless, Stripe isn't the primary focus or money maker until way later in the process, if at all.  You build an ecosystem of X number of web stores to give you Y number of options without spending any more time or money than you have to.  Of course my primary focus is eCommerce but there are other ways to monetize.   Enough of the sales pitch, in the highly unlikely event that our methods stopped working I would certainly make it up in more ways than one.  I don't leave people hanging.  All future updates are included.  That goes for all my listings.  Updates are few and far between but they are hefty.  The next update will focus more on PayPal and reviving the Polish IBANs, as well as various virtual methods to supplement and leverage our eCommerce ecosystem.  I'm still about 2-3 weeks out.   Thanks and let me know if you have any questions!  I saw your feedback on the market.  I appreciate your kinds words. Exactly.  A little creativity goes a long way.  There were payment processors before Stripe and there will be payment processors after Stripe.  The end result is the same.

Evolution Forums,Prince_Oberyn,8880,2014-08-13T02:16:12,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"I've recently got my hands on The Four Horseman guide and I gotta say it's by far the most comprehensive, useful and original fraud guide that I have read. In my opinion, it's also the best guide out there on how to properly perform and scale e-commerce fraud. The best part for me is that it goes beyond the Stripe API and Ladron+. You can use any payment processor compatible with Wordpress and cashout in many ways not just via ATMs. Another highlight is the method of virtually turning dirty funds, into semi-clean funds and then finally into clean funds, simply brilliant! Here's a quick overview for prospective buyers without giving too much away:  You will learn how to:1. Reuse and recycle your resources to maximize profits.2. Create and properly age Stripe accounts to get them into a 2 day payout schedule.3. Profit from other payment processors not just Stripe4. Efficiently automate fraud related tasks5. Turn your dirty funds into clean funds via Moka Magic... amongst other things. What you will get beside the guide and software:1. Post-sales support from Moka 2. Bonuses in form of documents, plugins, themes and videos3. Free future updates  The minimum ressources and knowledge that you will need:1. Basic wordpress/ woocommerce and web administration knowledge   - set up domains and hosting- create and design wordpress.org web stores 2. Loads of bank accounts (not Polish IBANs and not Ally accounts)3. Good CVVs 4. Document scans 5. Basic security set up (VPNs etc.)6. Fullz Who can benefit the most1. People with wordpress, web admin and design skills2. People with regular access to bank accounts3. Experienced virtual carders in general Who will benefit the leastPeople with limited resources and little to no wordpress/ web administration skills. However, if are willing to put in the required effort, you will be able to work around that. It'll be difficult in the beginning, but there really is no such thing as easy money!  How much you can earnYou can potentially earn astronomic amounts. It's all up to you. The more effort you put into your operations, the more you will be able to earn.  On the vendorAs many others before me, I can personally vouch for Moka and his work as well. He is overall friendly and professional and offers great post-sales support. We've been also doing a bit of business together, which always went straight up smooth with no bullshit whatsoever, I appreciate that!  My verdict The guide is worth every penny of your hard earned money, it's the best investment you can make if you want to get into e-commerce fraud.I rest my case!

This are professional sales and marketing plans.  I am not an expert by any means, but I can tell you that Moka is very detailed in his explanations and his guides are very comprehensive.  His guides are like College courses, I already know this is going to require reading and studying and going back to the textbook for more learning.

Moka as somebody stated is a genius and a professional at being able to translate his knowledge into a guide that can be understood by most willing to take the time to read and study.  Being able to translate knowledge into a guide is not an easy task and Moka accomplishes this task as professional business writer with a Ph.D. Thank you Moka for taking the time to write such detailed guides and for sharing your experience, creativity and knowledge with those of us not as bright and as ingenious as you.

If yes do you give some details about the use of the paypal in your method because I'm a newbie too about paypal  (I don t want to get stock because of paypal)I see on your post I have to use a plugin called ladron+, so i m really limited with computer skills (just basic skills, using vpn, socks, browser google lol  nothing special about my skills but I learn fast:) , I'm not a programer and doesn t have any IT skills), do you give a detailed instructions on how to use this plugin ? is it easy for somebody like me to use it ?I'm planing to spend lot of time in east asia (maybe ending by staying there , but I can come back to the US anytime hehe does your method will work there ? Can I cashout the money over there or cashout only in US ?Last question haha I see I can pay as an option for ""Turn-key packages"", what is that ?Sorry for those stupid questions heheheWill really appreciate if you answer me Sorry for the delay.  I just saw this.  I think my Beginner's CVV to PayPal would be better suited for someone in your situation.  It's much less expensive and easier to start.  You need to be comfortable with things like simple Linux commands, scripting, the basic premise of popular web application stacks.  Everything in the guide is powered by WordPress for a reason but there is still a bit of learning curve.  I do explain everything in detail but I expect you to know the basics.  A turn-key package is a web store delivered fully configured with all software, ready to go.  There is still a bit of management needed and you need to run this as you would your real business.My advice to you is to start with the CVV to PayPal guide and read up on WordPress before spending your money on the full package.  Thanks"

Actually, come to think of it, I could aswell ask these questions in here, some other may find it interesting aswell...: Just a few things. Your thread is full of good words, but compared to other guide threads, I can't find some basic informations though. I'm rather new to eCommerce Fraud... I learn very fast though, and am willingly to work hard aswell... Are there any other basic skills needed? What is needed to get going? Can I withdraw the money to one of those Polish Cards, or do I need a 'full' bank drop? Any idea of how to withdraw to BTC maybe? Those bank drops are rather costly, aren't they? Do I need to get physically attached to anything, like disclose my identity in any way? Is any physical activity at all needed for that to work, or is it just pure digital? How much would you say, is the initial investment to be made beside the guide? You say one does get it back within 1 week, but what does it need for that? How much work do you put into it, and how much do you get out of it? Lots and lots of questions, I'm sorry, to bother you that much... tongue",
Evolution Forums,moka,8880,2014-07-03T20:23:59,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"You should be familiar with WordPress.  It helps if you have an eye for design theory so your sites look nice and presentable.   It's difficult to find a merchant that pays out to a Polish anonymous card and even if you did, the daily withdrawal limits are very low. I always tells people that 800 USD, including guide and software, would get someone very well prepared.  That number includes CVVs, bank drops, hosting, everything. There's a lot of work in the beginning but I leverage automation tools.  I can spend 2 hours a day managing it once everything is built.  The hardest part is finding good CVVs.  If you have good data everything falls into place.",

I also want to know if maybe youd be willing to lend me a hand with getting that site working.  I put a bit of money down on it and left a good review.

Thanks --- All purchases get free updates and I expect to have the first major update in the next few weeks.   I am going to start offering bulk US Stripe accounts again in lots 10, 20, 50, 100.  Very good prices.  Very fast turnaround.  I will have an update regarding these before the weekend starts.",
Evolution Forums,vendoor,8880,2014-07-23T23:52:00,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"Absolutely incredible guide/method. The guide is one of a kind, and you will not look back on what you have spent.Don't expect a shitty $25 CVV > BTC guide ; this is something that restores my faith in the dark net. Still reading through the guide, and I received it this morning, it will be something that initially will take a fair bit of effort to get your head around and fully understand, but there's no such thing as easy money, and you should easily be making thousands within weeks if you play it well. Will post an update with results from the operation in the next few weeks.

Evolution Forums,BarnCat,8880,2014-08-06T21:54:44,Re:  | The Four Horsemen | Permanent Vacation CVV Cashout,Guides Vendors,"Hey there, moka. I bought another guide of yours that is pretty solid, and I'm interested in this one as well. I'm a little bit short on cash right now so I was wondering if you would be interested in a trade. I have an MDA synthesis guide that uses entirely unwatched chemicals, the process is even completely legal up until the last step where the MDA is produced. It's written to produce 1Kg of MDA in each run for about $1200 in chemicals and $800 for equipment. I believe it would be a fair trade, seeing as how 1Kg of the stuff goes for around $30k (at least in my part of the world). I sent you a pm about this a few weeks ago but didn't hear from you so I figured I'd give it just one more shot. Hit me up if you're interested",

I'm wondering why customs would seize some but not all my packages, and why they would even open a small seemingly innocent envelope at all. this is not my first deepweb purchase and i used sr1 so is it possible i am on record as being a recipient? i have already cleared my home of any narcotic substance but am now wondering what my next step should be (additionally all my addresses were sent via pgp) should i be worried? edit: i also receive a large amount of legitimate packages from all around the world so it's strange that these particular ones were searched

Evolution Forums,bendavis89,55523,2015-03-13T00:45:18,"Re: packages seized, should i be concerned",Security & Anonymity,LE buys from vendors and back traces the package origins and stealth methods. This way they can find all incoming parcels that match the info they have gathered. It may not be you they were on to it may have been the vendor. Also once they arrest a vendor they use their accounts to get addresses and orders to track other people down.,

[$$$],Guides Vendors,"I know that I am not a big, known, member of this community, but I'm going to give my review for this guide anyway. If you don't trust my judgment, it's not my problem I've had the guide 2 days ago. And here's my review.  INTRODUCTION YOU NEED TO WORK TO MAKE MONEY!!! I never trusted guys who claims that they found the ""big method to have TONZ of money in minutes"". Even in carding and fraud you have to work, and usually the more and hard you work, the more you gain. This concept applies 100% on this method : More work = MORE GAIN! REVIEW Once read the method I clapped my hand on my head and said ""holy bitch! Why didn't I thought about that ???"" Well... Coin DID thought about that and... it WORKS ! but let's consider each factor involved  Setup You need at least a good knowledge of carding and involved setup. But this applies EVERYTIME you need to use CC for fraud, so nothing new here. Anyway, Coin is absolutely helpful in case you need. If you are a total noob, you'll probably get frustrated for some time. If this is the case, remember what I said before about the hard work and apply the same concepts to get better in carding. Knowledge about the elements of USA Fullz would be good, if you don't want to ask yourself ""Why I have to do this ?"" every single time you try to use Skrill. I mean things like SSN, DOB, MMN, address and phone numbers history.  Phone calls involved You need at least to be average skilled in speaking english. I'm not from a english-speaking country but my average english is good enough. Don't be too afraid of this anyway... You won't have to explain the plot of ""Matrix Reloaded"" on the phone... just some good old questions-and-answers. Method and saturation The concept of the method is simple, as I said before. The good thing is that's it's not just 1 site to be targeted, so saturation will eventually happen some day... I am a medium-paranoid kind of person but I don't see it happen soon. Obviously, since I am now one of those who paid $500, I hope that it doesn't leaks and that Coin keeps the goal to sell 10 pieces and no more.  Price I think that even if an idea is simple, if it works it deserves the right price. Considering not only the guide, but the tutoring that Coin gives customers for the first tries, I'd say that the price is much more than fair.  In the end, I give the guide a good 8/10  TheWinch",

Sneak peak of the guide: gyazo.com/485a414575114d24a963d51c238da371   NOTE: I sent Bigmeesh and  Kingsup the guide. Hopefully hear from them soon.  INTRODUCTION: Hey guys its Coin. After setting up a interest check about this method I have received a huge amount of positive feedback on its release. I have finally finished making the perfect guide for Fullz to BTC. Now I'm going to be honest. This guide isn't a magical golden method. But I can guarantee that it works as I have made around a rough $11K in the past 1 - 1.5 months of testing this method.http://gyazo.com/e9a5c3248afeb507d1cee794e11affc6 (clearnet warning) This guides saturation rate is extremely low as the sites you card are involved in a billion dollar industry.This method can bring in a max of $1,000 USD per card (no more) and there are factors which can limit you from carding so much. But I guide you on how to bypass that as I have mastered this method (at least I believe so haha).  This guide is not for you if you are not willing to put in at least 1-2 hours to make profit.  REQUIREMENTS: 1. Fullz (Preferably 3+)2. Socks 53. Firefox Addons (explained)4. Background Report Account (Intelius recommended).5. Phone Number (Skype number recommended) + All included on how to get it with your Fullz Frequently Asked Questions: 1. Why are you selling this if you have made so much?A: Technically I make around $300-$500 per day so $500 for a guide is a massive contribution to my revenue, and since the method can't be saturated, this is a increase in my income. 2. How did you discover this methodA: It wasn't much of discover, I was based around both worlds of this Carding game and (*******) game. 3. Can I have a vouch copy?A: No 4. Why not offer tutor services?A: My time is extremely valuable as I am working on another method so I cannot tutor you. My picture and word method on a .pdf should be good enough in my opinion 5. How much time requirement?A: 1 hour is the average time. 6. Do you explain the carding setup?A: I explain mine, but its not compulsory, you can do mine or yours it doesn't matter. 7. Why is this guide $500? A: If you think about the profit you can make on the first day (almost no waiting time of cashout), And you can't spare $500 out of your wallet to gain this kind of knowledge. Thats shallow. Expand, learn, and profit. Any other questions post below or PM me. LISTING: CONTACT DETAILS: COINTCF@JABBER.ATICQ: 652987932

Could amazon send police to my house if i'd double dip too many items?",

Evolution Forums,eyesonly456,649,2014-01-22T14:33:50,Paypal to BTC Cashout,Guides Vendors,"Hi, This works best with clean/middleman paypal accounts. You upload the paypal amount to a site that helps us cashout with cash out the funds within 24hours (can take a maximum of three working days if it flags) we send you the profit in BTC and then you are told to issue a charge back against the site. You are paid a profit of 25% for your paypal payments the profit is sent in the form of BTC or you can request a different method (please note WU and MG are not a method I pay out in) So in principal you can make 250 for every 1000 you send in paypal and you get your initial investment back. Better to do with clean or middle man accounts. Will NOT be working with Hacked accounts or CC on this method due to the charge backs coming to quickly. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/896 Regards Eyesonly P.s You can just order 1000 of funds from Susp3ct and then it use that here (I have worked with him before on TCF and his funds have been good).",

Opportunities to go for bigger prizes as well but i was just keeping it simple to test it.Another bonus all phones were delivered next day so no chance of getting cancelled, once the order goes through you are good no way of owner finding out like the upgrade profiles. There is also more than one way he gives you to get these phones and i only tried 1 as it worked every time but will be trying the others this week, assuming i can get more fullz!!Anyway i got £950 off 3 sets of fullz without even running the cards all phones sold on gumtree/craiglist in a few days of listing.  I was also doing the vodafone upgrades for quite a while which were great whilst they lasted but this is the new one for me until you all kill it!!Again thank you for letting me test it MH9 - That's a stoners review:);Limiting this guide to 10x sales;Price - £150 which you can easily make back in 1 delivery;Limiting this guide to 10x sales;http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/87899"

All phones will be locked to the 1st sim which is put in them, so if you keep unactivated, they can be used with any SIM until one is entered.....",beatsbyray wrote:is this only for the UK

The method is simple. The only issue i had was getting fullz close to my drops as they are quite rural but i managed to get 4 sets after messaging a few vendors who were all happy to provide a postcode search for me. In a couple days I managed to get 2 iphone 6 16gb and a iphone 6 plus 64gb (got braver after 1st 2 tries worked) The 4th set of details i had were missing the bank acc no so couldn't complete that, but no reason why that set would not of worked either. Opportunities to go for bigger prizes as well but i was just keeping it simple to test it. Another bonus all phones were delivered next day so no chance of getting cancelled, once the order goes through you are good no way of owner finding out like the upgrade profiles.  There is also more than one way he gives you to get these phones and i only tried 1 as it worked every time but will be trying the others this week, assuming i can get more fullz!! Anyway i got £950 off 3 sets of fullz without even running the cards all phones sold on gumtree/craiglist in a few days of listing.   I was also doing the vodafone upgrades for quite a while which were great whilst they lasted but this is the new one for me until you all kill it!!

That is just bad idea really, always better to go somewhere for the AP like public wifi in a busy city, or even stealing a neighbors. Home is a no no.  If you are using windows, windows has a ""bug"" that causes DNS leaks quite often. It is a problem with most VPNs and google can possibly help you. Look up ""windows VPN DNS leak"" for some info. However, if you are not using windows it could be possible ""spying"" but the only way they could do this is by compromising your router, which is why you should not do felony criminal activity from home internet connection!  I would ditch the hard drive just to be safe IMO if you really did do it from home, on windows. Carding 10k+ will get them trying to find you. They attempt to investigate after 1k.",

As someone who has prior experience with Square, I wasn't expecting anything I hadn't seen before, however I was pleasantly surprised by the information I viewed in the .pdf provided. While the general idea isn't something new to me, the way it's implemented is new and unique and should be able to provide a steady stream of income to those who put it into use. I will say that the method WILL burn in time, however, unless it is leaked or sold to many more people than I forsee the vendor offering it to, it should serve to provide a good source for cashing out for the coming months. If you're new to fraud or are interested in hitting Square like back in the old, easy days, I would recommend this guide. NOTE: I haven't reviewed the ""update"" for the guide that I've seen mentioned in this thread, so if the vendor would like me to do so, I'll be sure to update my review once I've had time to properly look everything over.  Good luck to everyone who has a chnace to implement this method, and good luck to OP with sales!",

I know who already bought so , if you try to order I will cancel if you are not previous customer.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enough copies have sold. This guide will not have anymore updates. There are more advanced techniques that I left out in case this method got too saturated. That may or may not be available from me soon.  Because of the leakers / resellers I think they will burn the link between prepaids and Square very soon. I have several *unburnable* methods myself, including opening/using business bank drops, and cashing out MUCH larger. Unfortunately this will not be for sale.   * reason being there's nothing suspicious of the way I make the charges / business setup.   - New Breakthrough , bypass bank drop to not send in Utility Scan.- 6 month guarantee. Final Version .  There will be NO MORE updates.- I wasn't playing around, if you were the leaker you should be ashamed.  The amount of information in this guide was fresh and as tested as possible by me. I am greatly disappointed that ""one"" of you decided to leak the guide.  I priced it low to help you guys make money , but now I am gonna raise the price, with a final update .  This updated information is strictly classified. If you leak it , you're just gonna burn this prepaid for Square anyway.  Because of the leak / nature of this method. This update is not FREE for previous buyers.  I have however given a few members a preview of how to use it . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cashout PROOF ! https://infotomb.com/jh61k.png  $821 Deposit from Square, and I withdrew from two ATM's so far.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No more vouches will be given out, as there has been more than enough reviews.___________________________________________________________________________________  - I have a little suspicion this guide may been leaked.  - I will investigate. If there was a leak, Any Updates will not be included.  This is a fresh guide, if this burns Square will not support this routing type . -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Prepaid Cards Now Available !  PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK / REVIEW after Receiving.   PREPAID http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/87656   1. I will be providing sales of Unactivated Prepaid Cards soon  2. Adding VMware and Vip72 setup instructions.. For those who need to brush up on their basics. 3. As gratitude I will offer an upgraded version that comes with Unactivated Card.   LISTING LINK to GUIDE : http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/86680  Hello , this is the guide release from my interest check.  I have done it all myself from A-Z and this is the way to do it . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FE is not required.  I want you to follow directions and make some money.  You will need to invest about $60 of your own . but $60 to make $500 a day is well worth it, in my opinion. This method is for prepaid drops, if you have regular bank drops even better you will just get your money faster. However, i do not like burning my regular banking drops, So 7 days to verify a prepaid is fine by me.  You will get lifetime ICQ support so do not hesitate.  I am online a lot .  A discount vouch was given to a member here , he will post a review soon , however I sent him a live tutoring session before PDF was made. You can see my interest check and more details here:  http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=43062 Happy carding :]  --------------   Thanks ! Reviews:
 Last edited by transcendpro (2015-03-09 05:33:00)","Diamondzz wrote:I have NOT completed the method explained in the guide as of yet. This review is currently for the guide itselfFirst off I would like to say that transcendpro is a boss and is extremely helpful when it comes to his guide. In the beginning I had several questions I wanted clarified and transcendpro helped almost immediately and cleared up any questions I had. I currently have all the ingredients but am taking all necessary security measures so I have not yet been able to implement the method. Now, on to the product.The guide is in .pdf format and is written professionally, organized neatly, and describes everything that is needed for this method to work. This method does require a small investment to get the items needed and for me the investment was ~$65 plus approximately .08 BTC for some items available (and linked to in the guide) on Evolution. The physical items necessary can all be gotten at the same store, and they aren't anything that can't be found at a major retailer. I believe this small investment is 100% worth it for the expected return profits. You need to spend money to make money.The total time it will take before you can start doing any kind of cashing out via Square is 7 business days. This is because you need to go through a small verification process which is explained in the guide and is supported by very clever and useful information to achieve success. In the event that you fail verification, the guide offers help and gives a way to get back on track. Don't forget, transcendpro is a pro at customer support and any questions can be forwarded to his ICQ where he will assist you.What else is included in the guide?- Noob Carding Tips- International Tips- Random tips and techniques you will find while reading the guide- A sense that you've finally bought a guide worth the moneySo, can you make $500 a day? Granted you pass verification and have everything linked up perfectly along with good cards, yes, there is absolutely no reason you can't do so. However, I would rather be safe than sorry and mix up the amounts I card per day to avoid looking suspicious. Maybe 2 transaction one day amounting to $254.76 and then 2 days later do 3 transactions amounting to $486.95.Notes: You will have the best success with this method if you currently card or have ever successfully carded in the past. A noob with no idea what's needed for carding looking to get rich quick will more than likely fail and/or get this method burned.Guide: 9.5/10- Minus .5 points because some parts can go into a bit more detail but transcendpro will kindly answer any questions over ICQOriginality: 10/10- I've never heard of this method beforeDifficulty: 7.5/10- This method will require some legwork, investment, and a general idea of carding.Time from beginning to end: About 8 business days- If it weren't for the verification process, this wouldn't take so long but it's easily worth it. You can expect to have your first payment within 8 business days after putting this guide into actionVendor: 10/10- Transcendpro is extremely helpful when it comes to his guide and will answer any questions you have. He even gave me some extra tips and methods over ICQ when I came to him for help. A+As I've said before, I have not yet fully implemented this method but I am in the process of doing so. I will post updates as to whether or not it has been successful. To those thinking about buying, I'd say go ahead and take the shot. If you're money motivated and are disciplined and focused you will easily make a return of investment. As mean as this sounds, I hope transcendpro stops selling this method so it can't burn. I would love to milk this for a long, long time. Thank you transcend!;bongos wrote:I was given the opportunity to review this method earlier this week.

From getting the prepaid in hand , to linking to square it takes 7 days for verification , and then another 1-2 days of simple SE to get ACH communication established.       Estimated 10 days to setup and  Cash out.  2. I've had accounts that lasted for 2-3 weeks.  3. Charge cards for $145-150 and hope they don't chargeback too quickly.  So if you have 10 cc's .... use 3 a day , and reuse them if they still work.   4.

Evolution Forums,Diamondzz,47544,2015-02-12T05:42:08,Re: [GUIDE] Square Cashout. Make $500 a day from CCs. Make Bank Drops.,Guides Vendors,"I have NOT completed the method explained in the guide as of yet. This review is currently for the guide itself First off I would like to say that transcendpro is a boss and is extremely helpful when it comes to his guide. In the beginning I had several questions I wanted clarified and transcendpro helped almost immediately and cleared up any questions I had. I currently have all the ingredients but am taking all necessary security measures so I have not yet been able to implement the method. Now, on to the product. The guide is in .pdf format and is written professionally, organized neatly, and describes everything that is needed for this method to work. This method does require a small investment to get the items needed and for me the investment was ~$65 plus approximately .08 BTC for some items available (and linked to in the guide) on Evolution. The physical items necessary can all be gotten at the same store, and they aren't anything that can't be found at a major retailer. I believe this small investment is 100% worth it for the expected return profits. You need to spend money to make money. The total time it will take before you can start doing any kind of cashing out via Square is 7 business days. This is because you need to go through a small verification process which is explained in the guide and is supported by very clever and useful information to achieve success. In the event that you fail verification, the guide offers help and gives a way to get back on track. Don't forget, transcendpro is a pro at customer support and any questions can be forwarded to his ICQ where he will assist you. What else is included in the guide?- Noob Carding Tips- International Tips- Random tips and techniques you will find while reading the guide- A sense that you've finally bought a guide worth the money So, can you make $500 a day? Granted you pass verification and have everything linked up perfectly along with good cards, yes, there is absolutely no reason you can't do so. However, I would rather be safe than sorry and mix up the amounts I card per day to avoid looking suspicious. Maybe 2 transaction one day amounting to $254.76 and then 2 days later do 3 transactions amounting to $486.95.  Notes: You will have the best success with this method if you currently card or have ever successfully carded in the past. A noob with no idea what's needed for carding looking to get rich quick will more than likely fail and/or get this method burned.  Guide: 9.5/10- Minus .5 points because some parts can go into a bit more detail but transcendpro will kindly answer any questions over ICQ Originality: 10/10- I've never heard of this method before Difficulty: 7.5/10- This method will require some legwork, investment, and a general idea of carding. Time from beginning to end: About 8 business days- If it weren't for the verification process, this wouldn't take so long but it's easily worth it. You can expect to have your first payment within 8 business days after putting this guide into action Vendor: 10/10- Transcendpro is extremely helpful when it comes to his guide and will answer any questions you have. He even gave me some extra tips and methods over ICQ when I came to him for help. A+ As I've said before, I have not yet fully implemented this method but I am in the process of doing so. I will post updates as to whether or not it has been successful. To those thinking about buying, I'd say go ahead and take the shot. If you're money motivated and are disciplined and focused you will easily make a return of investment. As mean as this sounds, I hope transcendpro stops selling this method so it can't burn. I would love to milk this for a long, long time. Thank you transcend!",

Make Bank Drops.,Guides Vendors,"niccrx is right - it does take about a week to set up - and you have to be on top of your shit and diligent - start with one setup to begin with so you can get situated and don't be greedy - this is something you will want to make into your own system, and he already gives a lot of advanced techniques in the guide which will help you think of new ways to use this. I have seen a lot of people looking for a review on this guide.   I purchased this a week ago, and do to my own reasons, have yet to start it, so I will be honest when I say I haven't implemented it.    Transcendpro built this guide from the ground up, including an exclusive way to pass through an important ID safegaurd which at one point needed Scans.   The update prevents the scans which makes us all happy to save time and money. I highly recommend this guide.",

This review is currently for the guide itselfFirst off I would like to say that transcendpro is a boss and is extremely helpful when it comes to his guide. In the beginning I had several questions I wanted clarified and transcendpro helped almost immediately and cleared up any questions I had. I currently have all the ingredients but am taking all necessary security measures so I have not yet been able to implement the method. Now, on to the product.The guide is in .pdf format and is written professionally, organized neatly, and describes everything that is needed for this method to work. This method does require a small investment to get the items needed and for me the investment was ~$65 plus approximately .08 BTC for some items available (and linked to in the guide) on Evolution. The physical items necessary can all be gotten at the same store, and they aren't anything that can't be found at a major retailer. I believe this small investment is 100% worth it for the expected return profits. You need to spend money to make money.The total time it will take before you can start doing any kind of cashing out via Square is 7 business days. This is because you need to go through a small verification process which is explained in the guide and is supported by very clever and useful information to achieve success. In the event that you fail verification, the guide offers help and gives a way to get back on track. Don't forget, transcendpro is a pro at customer support and any questions can be forwarded to his ICQ where he will assist you.What else is included in the guide?- Noob Carding Tips- International Tips- Random tips and techniques you will find while reading the guide- A sense that you've finally bought a guide worth the moneySo, can you make $500 a day? Granted you pass verification and have everything linked up perfectly along with good cards, yes, there is absolutely no reason you can't do so. However, I would rather be safe than sorry and mix up the amounts I card per day to avoid looking suspicious. Maybe 2 transaction one day amounting to $254.76 and then 2 days later do 3 transactions amounting to $486.95. Notes: You will have the best success with this method if you currently card or have ever successfully carded in the past. A noob with no idea what's needed for carding looking to get rich quick will more than likely fail and/or get this method burned.

It's not a classified drug I believe but merely and only a prescription only medication... So I answered my own question!! I need to know if you can legally be sent POM through UK cutoms, what amount is deemed to be personal amounts and do you need accompanying documentation, do you have to pay VAT? I heard there is a loophole that means you can be assessed with out a face to face consultation so it should be easy to do?

Evolution Forums,strace,1247,2014-02-01T18:41:51,Re: Using Carded items is it safe?,Security & Anonymity,"I'm going to give hax0r the benefit of the doubt by assuming he hasn't slept in a while.  Replacing wifi cards because of LE tracing MACs? LOL. Mac addresses are easy enough to change on the software side, you could change the macs on your network cards to automatically spoof whatever you want from the moment they got online and they'd stay persistent across reboots. Even suggesting they need to be 'replaced' because of a lousy mac address is very unhax0r-like.  About LE tracing wifi macs, well you wouldn't have it exposed in the first place after changing it, but even if you did I'm absolutely positive LE does not run wifi honey nets looking for mac addresses that 'might' be on some manufacturer black list somewhere of belonging to carded laptops. The whole idea is just bat shit. Busting you five-o style for that wouldn't be anything like a routine issuance of a speeding ticket. There'd be all sorts of constitutional issues and just think of how high the false positive rate would be seeing as how the first thing carders do is find innocent people who will happily buy them.  It would be a obscene waste of time and resources and the very concept would never be approved for funding because it so totally lacks focus.  Let's see. Maybe if you were using the mac of a laptop you carded and they were already onto you and needed only to figure a way to bring you in (because they just somehow lacked physical evidence that could tie you to the crime LOL) they'd go after you that way. If that sounds ridiculous to you it's because it pretty much is. If they were onto you already you're pretty much fucked regardless of the legitimacy of the mac you're masquerading behind.",

Requirements: Basic Internet SecurityA paypal account that you control (funds will be semi-clean by the time they get there)Able to follow step-by-step directions I started messing around with this method since TCF went down, and I've got it working 99% of the time.  The only time it doesn't work is if the credit card is closed, or there are no funds on it.   Yesterday alone, I was able to transfer just under $5,000 USD to my account, and it took me about 2 hours on the computer.   This method is a good money maker, and it's quick and easy.  Other methods I've bought requires a ton of steps and time.  This is very simple, and I have screenshots where you can follow step by step.  I am also always available on jabber:  dogman@jabber.at I am not selling on the marketplace just yet because I want to still be able to make purchases there as a client (and you can't if you're a registered vendor).  I'm not sure what methods of escrow, if any, there are here, but I've been around for a little while on TCF with a vouched status.  If there is any concern there, just PM me and we can work it out. I am selling this method for $100 USD.   I want you all to have a chance with this method and get $5 grand like I did, so please understand that while it seems expensive, you'll definitely make up for it.   Please PM me or contact me on jabber.

It's supposed to setup a sandbox/jail for programs easily. All you have to do is run a command with firejail as the first argument like this I tried to configure google chrome (chromium) for darknet browsing suggested here CLEARNET https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2woiq4/setting_up_chromium_to_work_with_tor_resubmitted/But I never felt comfortable with it due to the WEBRTC. After a lot of testing the only way to stop it is with a script blocker. Nothing else I tried worked. I don't trust Google for shit. Firejail takes advantage of the seccomp module and Linux Capabilities. This program should reduce exposure if there is a critical bug in our browsers or even 0days. Try this: Firemon is a way to monitor jailed programs opened with firejail. It lets you know what the program is loading and trying to access.

Evolution Forums,Emmet,56699,2015-03-17T00:00:00,Re: Firejail - Easy sandbox for all your Linux programs - Step up OPSEC,Security & Anonymity,"I can't understand why anyone would want to use Google Chrome (whether it's supposedly configured or not) for browsing DM's on the deep web.   Another option is to use an air-gapped PC for running any suspicious code or opening any downloads (although it's not recommended downloading anything over Tor) instead of using a sandbox.  You could just use an operating system such as Qubes which would basically achieve the same result. It runs everything, including all your applications, from numerous AppVM's providing you with virtual isolation of Tor from applications as well as virtual isolation of applications from each other.   Another secure set-up which is currently getting some good reviews is to run Qubes + Whonix together on a host PC. While it is quite a secure set-up, it's certainly not bulletproof and is still potentially vulnerable to attacks. Whonix runs on top of Qubes as a VM (virtual machine), just like any other typical OS does in Qubes. Qubes is based on Xen and Fedora and provides a world class security-by-isolation architecture while also offering a user-friendly desktop experience where everything is stored in and run from VMs. Whonix is based on Debian and Tor, and provides a two VM split security architecture with isolated Whonix-Gateway (ProxyVM) for total Tor traffic routing and Whonix-Workstation (AppVM) for user desktop applications, which serves as a tailored OS environment for Tor-based privacy/anonymity. With Qubes + Whonix, you install Qubes as a hypervisor onto your host computer, preferebly running a Linux distro (not Windows!) and then install Whonix as two separate TemplateVMs on top of Qubes.",

This is a technique that we recently discovered relating to a few major electronic international brand stores. It exploits a flaw within the store system they have set up - which allows you to get up to 2 (two) free PS4s or Xbox ONE's in person and from each store. Now, don't get me wrong this is not a guide that shows you how to take and run safely.. not at all. This is one of the safest, easiest, intellect-driven, in-person exploit up to today in the field. With this, nothing limits you from maximizing your benefits but yourself. You could for example go around all stores in your city and get 15-20 in a day and do the same 2-3 days later etc. How you want to do it is up to you.

I've always used Vip72 and never had any problem. I use Vip72 in 2 computer in 2 different houses and now suddenly none of them is working anymore.I also tried to buy again another subscription with another account but i still cant surf with Firefox.

If they don't find anything during a 'raid' nothings gonna happen, otherwise I could just send some drugs in very poor stealth to some people I don't like and get them out of my way  Also 'raid' is just 2 cops coming and searching your place, no guns no swat no dogs.

I was arrested recently (but found un-guilty due to a hell of a lawyer) and haven't been active on anything. I'm not LE, nor has LE taken over my account; but I need to make money to pay for legal fees and this is one of the methods I've been using to do this. I've paid off $30K+ in legal fees and I did this in less than 100 days - ironic that I get arrested for committing a crime, then I pay for the legal fees that got me out of it, by committing another crime... lol. You can make carding 10X easier than it already is. If you're a newbie, this method will be of your best interest. You WILL make your money back within a day or two, I can promise you that. I will also include a method that will allow you to get out of the game and put an extra few thousand in your pocket for the month. I also use that method. I am selling this method for a flat rate of $400. I will only be selling 4 copies (ONLY 2 COPIES LEFT!). This method cannot be saturated.

The guide is short and to the point, but not hard to understand. I am writing this review before I actually get the chance to attempt it for myself, but it should be interesting to see what I can get the third party to card. To my understanding, I could probably use this method to obtain e-gift card codes, but it is something I will have to attempt and let the community know of my success.  TheTwinz does give you some ideas of what to card via the 3rd party, but you have to be creative and think out of the box a little. You will need a cashout method. Without going into too much detail, TheTwinz suggested Craigslist as one way he was selling off a item that could be printed out. No drop address needed for this type of cashout.  I see crazy potential with this method, but it does seem like the third party will catch on if too many individuals saturate the method. I will be back within 1-3 days with a more in-depth review of my success.",

And if I understand the method correctly, the purchases may not even be directly purchased with the credit card that you provide. The credit card will be charged by the third-party. So if they have amazon send that gift-card code as a gift to your drop email, Amazon won't be alerted of the fraud unless the third-party repots it. So you would have plenty of time to use the code before/if anything is done about the situation.  I promised everybody my results with this method and I ask you to await about two more days. Monday-Wednesday are generally busy days for me. And I have the rest of the week to experiment around with this method

And if I understand the method correctly, the purchases may not even be directly purchased with the credit card that you provide. The credit card will be charged by the third-party. So if they have amazon send that gift-card code as a gift to your drop email, Amazon won't be alerted of the fraud unless the third-party repots it. So you would have plenty of time to use the code before/if anything is done about the situation. I promised everybody my results with this method and I ask you to await about two more days. Monday-Wednesday are generally busy days for me. And I have the rest of the week to experiment around with this method "

Evolution Forums,snoopy77,48718,2015-02-10T14:57:23,Problems with Fake-Packstation,Security & Anonymity,"Hi Guys,I ordered a Fake-Packstation from the german vendor Packstati0n.I only logged in a few times after buying the Fake-Packstation via a german and safe VPN to see if it actually works.I ordered goods on Evolution to this Packstation-Account and two times it actually worked.But my last order, 1 month after buying the Fake-Packstation, didn't arrive at the Packstation, so I tried to log-in to my account on paket.de, but it didn't work.An error occurred and I was told, to contact the Service-Center.As I talked to a DHL-employee on the phone, he said, that my account was blocked and couldn't be unblocked, due to some safety issues and I should call the police.I never logged in via Tor or via suspicious VPNs. Now I a friend of mine's account was blocked, too, and someone told me that numerous accounts with 9 numbers, beginning with an 8 and without a dot after the forename, were blocked, because the faking method wasn't safe or whatever. I just wanted to know, if anybody here on Evolution had to deal with the same issues? Hallo Leute, Ich habe bei dem Vendor Packstati0n vor 1 Monat eine Fake-Packi gekauft.Ich habe mich lediglich nach dem Kauf ein paar mal mit einer sauberen deutschen VPN Verbindung eingeloggt, um zu sehen, ob der Account funktioniert.Dann habe ich mir 2 KÃ¤ufe an diese Packstation schicken lassen und alles hat funktioniert.2 Wochen spÃ¤ter habe ich wieder etwas auf die Packstation bestellt, dummerweise ohne den Account vorher nochmal zu checken, ich dachte bei einer Sperrung etc. wird man benachrichtet.Das Paket kam nicht an und so versuchte ich mich wieder bei meinem Account einzuloggen, was nicht funktionierte.Ein Fehler trat auf und ich sollte das Service-Center anrufen, was ich auch tat.Dort wurde mir gesagt, dass mein Account wegen Missbrauchsverdacht gesperrt wurde und ich ihn nicht wieder entsperren kÃ¶nne, auÃerdem solle ich die Polizei verstÃ¤ndigen.Ich habe mich nie Ã¼ber Tor oder mit auslÃ¤ndische oder blacklisted IPs eingeloggt. Der Account eines Freundes wurde ebenfalls, ohne ersichtlichen Grund gesperrt und dann habe ich gehÃ¶rt, dass mehrere Accounts mit 9 Stellen, beginnend mit einer 8 und ohne Punkt nach dem Vornamen von diesen Sperrungen betroffen seien. Jetzt wÃ¼rde mich interessieren, ob jemand Ã¤hnliche Erfahrungen gemacht hat und ob es evtl. an der Faking-Methode liegen kann, da ich mir sehr sicher bin keinen Fehler gemacht zu haben.

He really spoon feed us, It cannot be more clear, really after you read everything and understand the all process, if you contact alpha02 to get some support it s mean you are in the wrong bizz, and carding is not for you, just use your brain !!!!His guide is about 100% SE so if you are uncomfortable with SE this tuto is not for you.He s talking really about everything from step1 (how to protect yourself, how to get card who will work 100% to buy high amounts $$$$, and beat any security on your way. Until the last step, taking your items safely without getting caught).I guarantee you if you follow step by step this guide you will make big $$$.This is not easy method (I mean for lazy people hehe), you will need to make a big preparation for every website you will card, but it's hell of worth it.This guide is more for US people, but worth to have it even for EU, Asia... , if you understand the process and have some ways to get the resource to get the info about the owner of your cards, you can use this method outside of the US easily. This guide is not just a method but it will learn you how the banks and other companies work and think about frauds, learn you to make fullz by yourself with just a regular cvv (even more than fullz hehe). You can make your own method (doesn t matter from which country you live) if you smart enough.By the way this guide is not worth 50$, it should be really a lot more, he should t even sell it, he should keep it for himself hehe (we are lucky to have you alpha02). he is really generous on this one !!!!!!!I really hope nobody will try to resell this guide, it will be a shame because this a real money maker again. But I'm sure some losers without balls will resell it :tantrum:The last thing I will say, even if you are a newbie, you got some balls, you know how to talk on the phone, being patient and you are confident of yourself, you will have success for sure I really consider myself to be lucky even if I paid for it. 50$ this is fucking free !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HANDS UP FOR ALPHA02:luck: mates hehehe;lot_oo7 wrote:if u wanna ATO with a very good PTO... i will recommend Alpha guide..

I was skeptical from the very beginning. I asked from the vendor if he can help me card things like apple products outside of usa and he said yes. Well can anyone explain is it normal that you have to take over someones bank account to order stuff. I dont think so. I ordered 700$ sneakers few days ago without taking over someones bank account and calling to the bank. How do you explain that Alpha02 ? There should be easier ways to order electronics. I payd 0.7 bitcoin and i have worked through all this material 2 or 3 times already and 90% of shit there is for USA. I made a dispute and the moderator who is obviously alpha02 friend gave all my money to him. I think i got scammed... And i have a bad feeling that evolution is corrupted aswell. So be careful everyone. Dont make the same mistake like i did.,

Evolution Forums,alpha02,11823,2015-01-24T12:47:36,"Re: (X-MAS UPDATE) * My carding book, my best knowledge",Guides Vendors,"snakes, instead of doing vendor bashing, just admit that you tried to pull a quick one with me and get info for free; which didn't work. If I buy a book at a book store, read it, and return it, they won't refund me. You got the standard procedure to card electronics: get your cards, perform ATO (2 phases), card site, prepare your drop. All the procedure is described to prepare burner phone and make sure you are successful. What snakes was telling me is, he doesn't want to ATO, setup a burner, etc. He just wants to put a card on a site and receive macbooks in the mail without any effort. If it was that easy, every newbie here would be a millionaire. There is a procedure to follow, it's all described in there, and if you follow it, you will get your stuff. There's no easier way. Just do what's there. RTFM. Read the manual. Simple like that. The money making methods work WORLDWIDE. I am not even from a Western country and still make substantial amounts of money with that. Again, forget that you're in Australia, and follow the procedure. Stop telling me that you're outside USA, because that's not relevant. I also answered many of his questions by PM to make sure everything would be all right, but all those answers could easily be found in the guide, which proves that he disputed before even reading the first chapters. snakes has been here for a while, and in over 20 orders, he disputed nearly 30% of this orders. I was hesitant whether to process or decline the order when it came in. What he was telling me is, I won't read the guide, just tell me step by step how to card a macbook. It's ALL in the guide. Read the guide before bashing vendors. If you don't want to make an ATO, or use the phone, there is no way to card a macbook, unless someone knows a deep secret that I don't. Carding clothes is way easier because merchants have a higher profit margin. They make 50% profit on clothes, whereas around 5% on computer stuff. That's why, yes, you maybe got a pair of sneakers without ATO, but you won't get a macbook that way. Liar, and I advise any vendor to decline orders from this guy in order to avoid dispute trouble. BTW, this is my first guide dispute in 228 Evo sales.

I had a similar situation happen to me as in alphas guide, but was for a cc taken out using fullz and scans so I had the physical card.  They cancelled it after 8 days of atm withdrawals and somehow must have gotten in contact with the real person.  So I called up the institution and was routed immediately to the fraud department once I passed verification.  Should have hung up then but I am stubborn so started ranting on about how dare they cancel my card etcetera.  The fraud person calmly stated that I was not who I was pretending to be and there was a bit of silence and they said we have your cell phone number and geolocation, to which I said yep, that's where fullz lives so why the fuck would I be anywhere else? Threw the phone in the harbour and dumped everything.",

Well can anyone explain is it normal that you have to take over someones bank account to order stuff. I dont think so. I ordered 700$ sneakers few days ago without taking over someones bank account and calling to the bank. How do you explain that Alpha02 ? There should be easier ways to order electronics. I payd 0.7 bitcoin and i have worked through all this material 2 or 3 times already and 90% of shit there is for USA. I made a dispute and the moderator who is obviously alpha02 friend gave all my money to him. I think i got scammed... And i have a bad feeling that evolution is corrupted aswell.

I also tried to look his guide up in google and cannot find it, to me this means his a well respected person and this guide is worth a lot more then some dumb guide hence no one is leaking it but just reselling it.  As Yasuo said make sure you look for the guide on google since some guides can be leaked. Ether way this guy on the top is selling it for 15 bucks so you won't get any updates but think to yourself is it worth it? I believe this guide can make me some money and get me out of the shit hole I'm in lol, but really I rather read it and learn and support the guy that made it rather then getting it for a cheap price. I know we're all Freedom Fighters here, but lets have some morals and at the very least show your support for the knowledge you have gained, because surely without it you wouldn't be here right now. I also just messaged Alpha about it so hopefully that guy gets banned:)

This guide entails you carding something which can be redeemed on a different site for clean payment to a iban. Its really that simple! There are multiple sites which you can card these items from...which are detailed in the guide. You can either card these items by online payment or as I have just found, over the phone. Due to the payment processors these sites use its also more than likely to go through as their security is fairly weak and the items you receive are immediately dispatched to your email (so there's no waiting around!) The site you redeem these items on require facebook access so you will need to find someone who sells these bulk or you can just create them by yourself by befriending a few random people and posting a profile picture, after that you can post them on the site for payment and this payment goes through the next business day! Theres nothing really more to say tbh I carded 2 items and received £160 straight to my drop the next day no questions asked, you could really make beyond 2k+ a week depending on how hard you go on this method!

Evolution Forums,mrsports,51461,2015-02-22T23:30:09,MAJOR CPA GUIDE: Make $200 Per Day Easily!,Guides Vendors,"http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/93331 Hello EVO!! I, Mr. Sports, am back with a new guide that I have tested out for the past month. In the past month of testing this guide, I have made close to $5000.   This method truly is ""on-demand"" income.  Whenever you need an extra $20-$200, just use this method and you can easily get it. This method is unlike any CPA guide you have ever seen, I GUARANTEE IT! The method explained in this guide is 100% legal and legit, so you can use your real information on the CPA networks.  In fact, I would highly recommend you use your real information, that way, you can get your payouts quicker. But this method is greyhat, so please keep that in mind. This method does require investment other than the purchase of this guide, but you will get your additional investment back very quickly, and you can then re-invest it. The additional investment required is anywhere from $20-Unlimited! You will get a 20%-75% ROI on your investment no matter how big or how small it is.  The smaller the investment, the higher the ROI. With bigger investments, the ROI is smaller, but the amount of money is much, much larger. As stated before, I have used this guide for the past month and I am almost at the $5000 mark. The price for this guide starts at $100, and will rise as more guides are sold. Only 15 guides will be sold! (To prevent saturation) No vouch copies are available at this time. Let's make some BIG money! http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/93331

Purchased a ekstern HD which i'm gonna install a win 7 copy on and encrypt the whole/entire system with truecrypt 7.1a. Got a prepaid 3G dongle too - Will last for a week and then ill just buy a cc to extend it . I'll use the 3G prepaid when im in emergency situations like when there is no open wifi avaible. So we go like this WIN 7 entire system encrypted >>> VPN >>> RDP>>> SOCK5 >> Logging in to emails to check keylogs / And carding paypal. Iam all good and ready to go?

PRICE HAS GONE UP. ONLY WILL SELL 5 COPIES. I LITERALLY TOOK A STOLEN PAYPAL AND CASH OUT 1K OF THEIR 1.8K BALANCE IN UNDER 24HOURS.  THIS METHOD WILL BURN EVENTUALLY BUT I WOULD IMAGINE IF EVERYONE ON EVO KNEW THIS METHOD IT WOULD STILL TAKE AT LEAST A FEW WEEKS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE THIS. YOU ARE GUARENTEED TO MAKE FREE MONEY WITH THIS METHOD! EASILY CAN CASHOUT THOUSANDS PER DAY  I am selling a personal private method on how to cashout paypal account balances anonymously and requiring no bank drop. This method will most likely work with hacked accounts, but I haven't tested it.   This will be done via Jabber and will take approximately 15minutes for me to explain everything in detail. You will have an hour of my time to ask any questions and from then on life-time support for any issues you have with the method.  Price & Avaliability Price: $290 (PRICE WILL GO UP EACH SALE) Copies Avaliable: 5  I will only sell 5 copies of this. I do not want it to saturate or become limited. With a proper account I have moved 1.5k in a day in semi-clean funds through these paypals using this withdrawal method.   http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/95746  THIS HAS NOW BEEN TESTED ON HACKED ACCOUNTS AND WORKS 100%. NOT ONE SECURITY FEATURE STOPPED ME FROM DOING ANYTHING. PRICE IS NOW $290.

After talking to refundsmith a little about his method and finding out how he cleans funds i can say that it is very original and unique. This could be very useful to a lot of people who have trouble cashing out paypals. I want to know the outcome when he tests his method with hacked accounts. This could be a new way to get past all of paypals security and bullshit. If anybody doesnt have access to a bank drop or some way to cashout a paypal this is the method you want to use.,

You dont have to delay your withdraws but depending on the amount of coins it can be good. The point is to hide your transaction among all other transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, if you are the only one sending 5000 BTC that day then it can be suspected to be the same person even if there are no direct link between the coins. You can create a withdraw on Blender without any delay and the coins will be sent instantly so there is no force in delay, please ead the ""Best-Practice for Top-Level Anonymity"" guide on the start page on Blender for some more info.

Evolution Forums,FliP,209,2014-01-16T06:54:41,Re: VPN Socks Proxy????,Security & Anonymity,"Some people also use their VPN's with TOR and vice versa. Here's a little rambling on the two Using VPN with TORPros:- The VPN provider will not see your real IP address but will see the TOR exit node IP- You will be able to connect to sites with TOR protection and connect to sites that refuse TOR- Major security layer in the event you pass through a compromised/malicious TOR exit node- Avoidance of any traffic discrimination from TOR exit nodes Cons:Slow as fuck Using TOR over VPN- VPN provider can see your real IP- VPN provider can not see your traffic content, real origin or real destinations.- The TOR entry node is unable to see your real IP address, it will however see the exit-IP of the VPN- Your are not protected against malicious TOR exit nodes if you send/receive unencrypted traffic to/from the final host you connect to. So which setup should you use you ask? It depends on what matters the most. If you're using a public WiFi and connection speed matters then TOR -> VPN is fine. That might be overkill though. Better safe then jail. If anonymity matters big time then Public Wifi -> TOR ->VPN = best anonymous setup / slow connection speeds. Good for certain things and terrible for others.  Hopefully this helps some peeps out there.",
Evolution Forums,psyclerdude,209,2014-01-16T05:40:22,Re: VPN Socks Proxy????,Security & Anonymity,"Generally the VPN is used to mask your local ISP and the SOCKS5 help you fake your location to websites you visit. Now you claim you can change your VPN at any time but its not as simple for most other users. Most VPN solutions do not allow for unlimited changes like that. Most of us run SOCKS5 proxies over the VPN so you can change from one socks location to another pretty fast. This allows you to stay logged onto your VPN and switch locations via proxy so you can card from different locations faster. A chain of proxies helps obfuscate your location but also leads to delays, lag and timed out connections. If you are building a shopping cart and your ip keeps changing your gonna have your transactions flagged. It's always better to have a stable proxy in place when carding. What VPN are you using? Do they keep log files of your login and usage? Vip72 has a pretty cheap socks5 solution that seems to work great for lots of users. http://vip72.com/?page=register&type=152944",

Evolution Forums,mrsports,49644,2015-02-14T05:31:51,Coaching: $50-$100 Per Hour With Binary Options: 5 VOUCHES AVAILABLE,Guides Vendors,"Hello all! Building off the success of my last guide, I thought I'd bring something even bigger and better to the table this time. Binary options have blown up in the past few years.  I first heard about the in late 2011, and tried them out with a $200 deposit.  I lost it all within a few hours. That sucked, and I gave up on binary options for almost 3 years.   In late 2014, I started noticing that binary options were getting even bigger.  I figured I'd give it a shot one more time, but I'd go in with a good plan.  This time, it worked, and I've made almost $20,000 since November 2014.  Not huge money, but I haven't really scaled this up either. I wasn't going to share this method, but I figured that the binary options brokers are just like bookies: they have so much money, they don't notice a couple thousand here and there, even if it's from a couple hundred people.  You have to understand that there are literally thousands of people losing colossal amounts of money on these brokers' sites everyday.  I have safely taken my $20k, and I know I can help a few others do the same. Here is one extremely important point, and what helped me make that $20k within a few months: The vast majority of binary options brokers are rigged.  They are SCAMS, and the odds are NOT in your favor. Here's why that point is important to me and my coaching: I exploit all the binary options scams out there.  Especially the rogue brokers. So what will you get with my coaching? 1: The exact brokers to use my methods on. 2: The exact way to place your trades in order to stay in profit. 3: The exact places to get the information on which trades to place. 4: How much to deposit, where to deposit, and how to deposit. 5: Two hours of 1-on-1 coaching with my over an instant messenger application. The coaching for the first 2 people is $50. In the interest of being transparent, here is what else you need: - $200-$250 to deposit into a broker account - A working payment method, like Neteller, to deposit to that broker. - Valid information in order to sign up for the broker account and get your withdrawals from them. And just in case you were wondering, this, like my other method, is legal and whitehat.  No need to hide your identity here. Again, the first 2 coaching students will get in for only $50.  After that, the price will be raised to $75, then $100, etc. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/90102 UPDATE:  5 Vouches are available.  Please note that you will still have to deposit $200-$250 under the broker I tell you to, in order to make my methods work.

Each method is NOT available currently on the marketplace by any other vendor. Each method comes with PROOF of EARNINGS inside.   GENERAL Frequently Asked Questions - F.A.Q.   Do I need vpn,socks matching the CC etc.? Yes. If you have not carded before, I suggest you stay away from these methods. They are for people who have at least a basic understanding of how to operate with cards.  Do your methods worldwide? Yes, ALL of them do.  Have you tried your methods before? Weird question but yes, many, many times in last months. Each method is TESTED and PERFECTED to find the easiest loophole to generate CC to Bitcoin usually instantly.  Can you show proof of your earnings in bitcoin for each method? Yes. After you have purchased any of my method, you can view my various verifications of payments and cashouts all put in the selected method-guide, conveniently for you.  Are you selling your methods because they are burned or have outlived their usefulness? No. All methods are alive and working perfectly.  Why are you selling your methods if they are not burned and if you are making huge profits? I am carder and hacker for many years now and I have learned NEVER to stay reliable on ONLY ONE OR TWO methods - so should you as a matter of fact.Because I do not stop researching new techniques, I recently found out new ways to cash out and thus, the methods which I am selling do not havemuch relevance to me if they were to be burned - I have other ways of income. Also I know I am NOT THE ONLY ONE so this can get burned just by any chance if a lotof carders are using it. Simply put, I have decided to be a GOOD GUY and GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY.  How can I, as a potential customer, be sure that the methods will not burn? Unlike many of the greedy vendors out here, I know when to stop and when to not push my luck. Every method has simple instructions inside to keepa low-profile and stay undetected for months like I have.  How can I, as a potential customer, be sure that others will NOT kill the method? I can NOT give you such guarantee BUT what I CAN DO is limit the number of sales to enable these method only to a certain groupof people, not for all. Professionals with resources and skills only.  Why, as a potential customer, should I trust YOU as a vendor? The ugly truth is that vendors sell methods which offer UNREALISTIC RETURNS on your investments (in any form) and simply wantto take your BTC. Think about it. Why would vendors sell methods through which you can make HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PER DAY fora few bucks? Because the methods have BAD RATE OF SUCCESS or are UNTESTED or worse, both! I believe customers should NOT beLIED to by vendors but instead, vendors should BE UPFRONT and REALISTIC when discussing EARNINGS (potential and real...).Now, my methods will not make you 50 THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY DAY, BUT they will make you a decent amount of cash in the form of bitcoins.Having in mind it only takes a few hours per week, it is definitely worth your time and this is the core of my philosophy as a vendor.If you treat your clients time as your own, you will deliver only the most original and high quality products/services. If you doubt me as a vendor, check out my previous sales products - CrimeDB and selling USA CVV - both of which with high positive reviews.  What is the secret behind your methods? Very little detail in websites policy. The devil is in the details :-)  CC2BTC 2015 Standard Edition or CC2BTC 2015 Express Edition?Both methods work perfectly. The main difference is the Standard Edition will take around a month (1-2 hours required per week) to generate around $2,000 in bitcoins (give or take $500) because from each card you make just under $100 (limits) while with the Express Edition I have charged one single good-BIN CC multiple times for overall $1,500 in just a few hours.Another difference is the Standard Edition requires a full set of verification documents (list provided in method FAQ), a phone verification and a 24hr-48hr wait while with theExpress Edition you only need ONE document (see in method FAQ) and a 24hr wait if you submit during specific hours. The Express Edition is BETTER, FASTER to do and MORE PROFITABLE but with the Standard Edition any CC can be used since the amount is low and the chance for having those money on the card is high.  What does the customer receive when purchasing this method? A password-protected zip archive (password is released in vendor notes) which contains ONE (1) watermarked PDF.  Can you recommend a vendor for CCs/scans/PSD/Phone verification etc etc etc.? No. If you are not smart enough to handle finding these items then this method is not worth your time. Consider a job working as taxi driver...  Do you offer any type of ""support""? No. Everything is clearly written in the guides. It even has images so it is very easy if you have a basic grasp of carding and English language.  When will you ship my order? As soon as possible. Usually instantly, but can be delayed up to 24hrs.  I do not like your price. If you do not like my price, you can go to other vendors on Evolution (no need for names, you know who you are) and get ripped $100-$200 each time aa new ""update"" comes out for plain-stupid, old, non-working or burned methods.  Do you offer discounts?Yes. A good vendor always have discounted listings for new and old clients. If you are previous CrimeDB/Club 99 customer you can receive big discount, send me amessage to discuss more.  Do you have other methods?Yes, as I have stated earlier, I research for new ones constantly the ones not listed are NOT for sale at the moment. Do NOT ask me about selling or trading them. When and if I decide, I will release them for sale. CC2BTC 2015 Standard Edition *** WARNING TO NEWBIES AND SIMILAR ***: Using this method you will NOT make 10 MILLION DOLLARS EVERY SECONDlike all other guides claim to (yet they sell at low price, saying ""it will increase on next sale""tricking you into thinking it is deal of a lifetime) BUT it will make you a DECENT (~$2K) income per month for only a few hours per week work. Used website is international and offers to get CC to BTC. Verification with documents takes 24-48hrs. Afterwards cash-out to bitcoin is instant (when order is placed). To get this method working you MUST have: Full set verification documents (all-ID, Proof of Address, CC Scan) Phone(s) for verifications At least 1-2 Hours per week to dedicate  If the above is too big-league stuff for you to acquire or you are a total beginner at carding, then STOP READING this sales thread and close the tab.  However, if you are able to acquire these items and have the sufficient knowledge to card websites, please continue reading how YOU will BENEFIT from this method.  This method enables you with:  A good, steady income as long as you have CCs (don't need to be high balanced, meaning any CC will do the trick !!!) The possibility of not getting (basically) ripped by other vendors for their ""brand new make 10k per day method sell only for $5 plz fast"" non-working methods  Reviews of method:None for now.   Method-Specific Frequently Asked Questions - F.A.Q.   What CC is required? Any will do to be honest (any country, BIN). No need for spending big money on high balanced or non-AVS CCs !!!  How much can you profit per CC? Depending on the situation but normally from $80-$95 per card is a good estimate.  Can you REALLY, REALLY make $2,000 in bitcoin? Yes, I am NOT saying ""it is possible"" or ""it may"" like other vendors do, I say IT IS A REALITY because I AM DOING IT EVERY MONTH.  Can I get my initial investment for this guide back within a month? Yes, this is exactly what this guide is for - $2,000 (estimate, give or take $500) in bitcoins every month. CC2BTC 2015 Express Edition Used website is international and offers to get CC to BTC (Note: It is different website from the Standard Edition). Verification takes 24hrs if submitted during specific hours. Afterwards cash-out to bitcoin is INSTANT. To get this method working you MUST have: Only 1 (one) document required - either ID, Passport or Drivers License. When providing your selected document you need to ensure you have both sides, the document in high resolution (visible) and to be valid. If you can acquire such document, I suggest continue reading how YOU will BENEFIT from this method.  This method enables you with:  Draining entire Credit Cards to their limit (even debit cards to minus balance!) to buy as much bitcoin as you want - up to $1,500 per card Reviews of method:None for now.   Method-Specific Frequently Asked Questions - F.A.Q.   What CC is required? Any will do the trick. But if you want bigger returns on your card, choose a good high-level BIN.  Is fullz required? No, but it can be useful especially for USA identities because those who validate your documents might check DOB. This hasnever happened to me so the chances are, you do not need fullz.  How much can you profit per CC? Depending on the situation but normally I do from $200-$500 per card is a good estimate.  Can I get my initial investment for this guide back within a month? Yes. Very easy taking in mind you can make $200-$500, even if you buy on $10/card price you still make around $185-$485 pure profit in bitcoin.

Evolution Forums,hax0r,470,2014-01-20T07:12:34,Re: Starter questions on this set-up.,Security & Anonymity,"I don't believe so. Although some dongles do have GPS, I highly doubt that the GPS info from a $50 prepaid dongle would be sufficient evidence for LE to get a search warrant and enter your home. Most of these devices give off false GPS info anyway, sometimes claiming you are miles away from wherever you actually are, and they often dont work at all inside of homes, especially older homes which are known for causing interference with wireless technology (although you can still usually pick up 2G internet). I dont currently use the dongle method but I have owned many of these 2G/3G/4G dongles with GPS in the past for legitimate purposes, I was never once able to get the GPS functions to work inside my home, and my home is newer and has no issues with any other wireless technologies.","scythe wrote:hax0r wrote:I would not risk using a personal system for anything carding related.

Perhaps research, but once you're ready to act, you need another system thats secure. You can find a cheap laptop on Craigslist or even ebay for under $50. If you get it on ebay, remember to replace the wifi card with one you purchase at a store with CASH or off craigslist, as the MAC address can possibly be linked to the previous owner and traced back to you via ebay records. Also, do a format of the HDD and reinstall windows or linux. In my opinion, VPN is unnecessary as long as you take these precautions. You will still need SOCKS but that's for tricking paypal, not security.Another idea is getting a 3G/4G ""dongle"" from a retailer and paying for it with CASH.

Although some dongles do have GPS, I highly doubt that the GPS info from a $50 prepaid dongle would be sufficient evidence for LE to get a search warrant and enter your home. Most of these devices give off false GPS info anyway, sometimes claiming you are miles away from wherever you actually are, and they often dont work at all inside of homes, especially older homes which are known for causing interference with wireless technology (although you can still usually pick up 2G internet). I dont currently use the dongle method but I have owned many of these 2G/3G/4G dongles with GPS in the past for legitimate purposes, I was never once able to get the GPS functions to work inside my home, and my home is newer and has no issues with any other wireless technologies."

Evolution Forums,ImaPirateArr,33082,2014-11-19T04:18:06,Tor Project - TAILS for Dummies!,Security & Anonymity,"Tor Project - TAILS for Dummies! Are you using Windowz and the Tor Browser for all of your DarkNet activities because you don't know anything about Linux and don't wish to learn it even though it's far safer and more secure? Then you should be using the Tor Project's security-enhanced live Debian distribution called TAILS (The Amnesic Incognito Live System). It takes less than an hour to set up, includes everything you need to stay safe, and will retain all of your info on a small, discrete, and easily disposable USB/microSD instead of on your Windowz hard drive making it far more difficult for others to discover and far easier to dispose of if necessary. Whenever this guide tells you to search the net, don't use Google! Use StartPage as it doesn't track you or remember your searches. Never use Google again! https://startpage.comTails uses a modified FireFox browser called TorBrowser. Everytime you open it be sure to click the little ""S!"" icon in the upper-left next to the green/yellow onion and select ""Forbid Scripts Globally"". Get in the habit of always doing this, first thing everytime you open TorBrowser (anyone know how to set this as default?) Always wait for the green onion icon on the top taskbar before attempting to open TorBrowser or Electrum Wallet. You'll need a USB flash drive (min 4GB). I recommend getting a microSD USB adapter like the tiny one from Kingston. Search for model ""FCR-MRG2"". It's so small, you could easily swallow it if you had to! You'll also need either a BlankDVD + DVD burner, or a virtual machine like Oracle's VirtualBox to install Tails onto the USB card as well as an appropriate PC\Laptop. From the Tails Documentation:Tails requires an x86 compatible processor: IBM PC compatible and others but not PowerPC nor ARM. Mac computers are IBM PC compatible since 2006.1 GB of RAM to work smoothly. Tails is known to work with less memory but you might experience strange behaviours or crashes. Tested and working with these current versions:tails-i386-1.2.isoElectrum-1.9.8.gz.tar 1) Search for ""tails download"" and grab the latest version from the Tor Project or go to https://tails.boum.org/ 2) Either load the disc image into VirtualBox, or burn to DVD and reboot your computer and boot from DVD. Once TAILS boots up, click ""Login"" and wait for it to finish. 3)Goto Applications>Tails>Tails Installer and click ""Clone & Install"". Insert the USB card and once it shows under Target Device, click ""Install Tails"" and select ""Yes"" if it gives you a warning. 4) After the install completes, remove the DVD or close VirtualBox and reboot your computer with the USB card still inserted. 5) Select the USB card from your computer's ""Boot Menu"". This is usually accessed by hitting a key like F2, F8, or DELETE when the computer first boots. Check your computer's docs or look for instructions at the bottom of your screen when the boot text appears after restart. 6) Select ""Login"" when Tails boots up and then select Applications>Tails>Configure persistent volume and enter a password. Make it a good one that you can remember. This is the password that sheilds all of your persistent content such as PGP Keys, Bookmarks, Electrum Wallet, Password Keyring, sensitive text files, etc. After creating the volume you can select which content you'd like to be persistent. You can select everything if you'd like, but you'll probably want ""Personal Data"", ""GnuPG"", and ""Browser Bookmarks"" at the bare minimum. After making selections click ""Save"" and reboot into Tails. 7) At the login screen select ""Yes"" to Use persistence? and enter your password. Then select ""Yes"" to More options? and click ""Forward"". On the next screen enter an Administrator Password, this will allow you to change the content of the Linux system. Then click ""Login"". Note that now is the time to copy the content of your old persistent volume if upgrading a previous Tails installation. For an excellent HowTo, open TorBrowser and search for ""tails manual persistent"" in the StartPage Box to find ""Tails - Manually copying your persistent data to a new device"" on the Tor Project Webpage. 8) To add the Desktop (and most anything else) to persistence select Applications>Accessories>Root Terminal and enter the Administrator Password you selected at Login. Type ""nautilus"" into the terminal window to open Tails' File Browser. Select ""File System"" on the left pane and browse to /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/. Right-click on ""persistence.conf"" and select ""Open With gedit Text Editor"". Add the line ""/home/amnesia/Desktop"" to the bottom of the file (capitalization is important). If you intend on installing Electrum Bitcoin Wallet you should also add the line ""/home/amnesia/.electrum"", then save the file. Reboot back into Tails and login with persistence and an administrator password. Afterwards you may drag/drop icons from the Applications menu onto the Desktop, or right-click and ""Make Link"" to any other items for moving onto the Desktop. 9) You'll need PGP keys to communicate with people. Never distribute sensitive or personal information to ANYONE without PGP encryption, even if you THINK you know them. You may be mistaken. To create a Private/Public key-pair, left-click the icon on the upper right of the TaskBar that looks like a clipboard (OpenPGP Applet) and select ""Manage Keys"". Select >File>New from the menu and choose ""PGP Key"" then click ""Continue"". Enter your user name for Full Name and a secure email address if you have one (don't ever use a ClearNet email! Try Safe-mail or TorBox), if not then leave it blank then select ""Advanced key options"". Choose Encryption Type - RSA and Key Strength - 4096 then click ""Create"". Enter a password for your PGP encryption key and click ""OK"". This is the password you'll enter to decrypt messages people send to you. To export your public key for others to send you PGP messages select ""GnuPG keys"" in the left pane, select your new Personal PGP key in the right-pane and select >Edit>Copy from the menu, then open gedit and right-click/Paste it into the text editor. Then you can save it in your ""Persistence"" folder. Saving your private key is a little more dicey, but you can do this by right-clicking on your personal key and selecting ""Properties"", going to the ""Details"" tab and clicking ""Export"". Careful where you save this, as it may allow others to impersonate you.To import others public key so you can send them messages, copy and paste the key (including the lines BEGIN BLOCK and END BLOCK) into gedit and save. Then choose >File>Import from the menu in Passwords and Keys (OpenPGP Applet>Manage Keys) and select the text file. You can just keep adding new keys to the bottom of this text file and import it everytime you need to add more public keys to your keyring.Sending and receiving PGP in Tails is easy! Search for ""tails openpgp"" to find the documents ""Tails OpenPGP public-key cryptography"" for sending messages, and ""Decrypt or verify a text created using Tails OpenPGP Applet"" for receiving messages.In a nutshell, you copy text to the clipboard, use OpenPGP Applet to encrypt/decrypt, then paste the result to gedit. Simple!To practice your PGP skillz, send a plain-text e-mail containing your Public Key to adele-en@gnupp.de. She will respond with an encrypted message containing her Public Key. Decrypt it, save it, and import it using >File>Import from the menu in Passwords and Keys (OpenPGP Applet/Manage Keys) and send her another e-mail encrypted with her Public Key. She'll exchange messages with you until you're comfortable that you're doing it right. Quite nifty. 10) If you'd like to install Electrum Bitcoin Wallet you'll need to edit the ""persistence.conf"" file if you didn't do it in step 8:        Choose Applications>Accessories>Root Terminal        Input administrator password and type ""nautilus""        In the file browser navigate to /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked        Right-click on the persistence.conf file and choose ""Open with gedit""        Add the line /home/amnesia/.electrum to the end of the list of persistent folders        Save the file and close all the windows        Restart tails        Select ""Use persistence?"" and enter password        Select ""More options?"" from boot menu        Input an administrator password and click ""Login""        Boot into desktop and connect to Tor, then: Open ""TorBrowser"" and select ""Forbid Scripts""Search for ""electrum download"" (https://electrum.org/download.html/)Download ""Electrum-x.x.x.tar.gz"" Linux Source to your Persistent folderClick ""home"" on the Desktop to open the File ManagerSelect ""File System"" in the left pane and browse to ""/home/amnesia/Persistent""Right-click on ""Electrum-x.x.x.tar.gz"" and select ""Extract Here""Right-click on the new folder and rename it to ""Electrum""Close File ManagerOpen gedit from ""Applications>Accessories>gedit Text Editor""Select OpenBrowse to ""/home/amnesia/Persistent/Electrum/electrum.desktop""Find the line that starts with ""Exec=""Edit the line to say ""Exec=/home/amnesia/Persistent/Electrum/electrum""Find the line that starts with ""Icon=""Edit the line to say ""Icon=/home/amnesia/Persistent/Electrum/icons/electrum.png""Create a new line at the bottom that says ""Path=/home/amnesia/Persistent/Electrum""Select SaveClose geditClick ""home"" on the Desktop to open the File ManagerSelect ""File System"" in the left pane and browse to ""/home/amnesia/Persistent/Electrum""Launch ""electrum.desktop"" by double-clicking itSelect ""Mark as trusted"" from the pop-up windowRight-click on ""electrum.desktop"" in the file manager and select ""Make Link""Move the new link to the Desktop and restart ElectrumSelect ""Create"" from the pop-up windowMemorize or Save the ""Mnemonic code"" as this is how you can open this wallet on other devicesSelect ""Next"" and enter the ""Mnemonic code"" into the fieldSelect ContinueInput encryption password (this is the password used to send Bitcoins from your wallet)Electrum will complain about being offline.

Evolution Forums,popadoppalus,33082,2014-11-19T20:50:23,Re: Tor Project - TAILS for Dummies!,Security & Anonymity,"this is a pretty straight forward tutorial. i didn't see anything in there about verifying that you a using an untampered version of TAILs.  This tampering thing is more widespread than is commonly known. everyone should learn to to verify files using sha keys. for the truly paranoid there are methods for examining the integrity of each file in the build. Well Google is certainly more scary than NSA so far as the data that they collect and save. At least the NSA discards data on occasion. Google just buys more servers. that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't use Google, it just means that you need to understand that every thing you do on there will be saved forever. sort of like the permanent record they used to threaten you with at school. anyway for clear web or DW you can use Duckduckgo.com - which doesn't leave any tracks either. it seems to me that Noscripts option is selected by default and you have to click on the TOR button to 'temporarily allow scripts' in order to over ride this default. you need to do this in safe-mail.net (mentioned by OP) or you won't have full functionality like the ability to reply to emails. BTW safe-mail is located in Israel and don't play well with CIA or FBI, etc. Ask Jonathan Pollard. also they have their hands full chasing people who are intent on destroying Israel. they probably aren't too worried about your safe-mail traffic unless you are an Islamic terrorist. also safe-mail has a virtual keyboard on the screen, so you can defeat keyloggers. i have no idea if anybody uses it. every once in awhile safe-mail will prompt for a captcha on login, but i have skipped it accidently and just typed in user name and PW so i find that mildly amusing. one last note on safe-mail.net if you accidently type safemail.net (without the -) you get a interesting site showing hacker alerts, etc. there are additional configurations that are necessary to make TAILs fully functional that get added to the end. Also it is probably not safe to say that Linux is safer than windows. while it's probably true in most cases as windows has tons of security issues, but there are issues with Linux as well. just because you are using TAILS linux distro doesn't mean you are immune to malicious attacks. one feature not mentioned was not that if you do get compromised while online, a reboot will clear it out. also lacking was discussion of the VM. finally the Linux iso file is generall 1.09 GB so it will not fit on a CD, you need to use DVD. while you can use ISO Buster or ISO magic, i seem to recall having better luck with Nero. also the USB stick that use has to be able to be made bootable. All USB sticks are not created equal. in fact most companies that sell USB sticks exclusively, will not guarantee that they be made bootable. while most of them can, the issues with them are that most of them are made from recycled NAND chips and may contain as much as 80% bad sectors. the controller simply maps these out, but it might prevent them from them from being bootable. it's normally no big deal, but it just something to keep in mind if you are having problems. overall though it seems to be a good explanation of how to use Tails. there are drawbacks to the non-persistence issues as well as advantages. for example it's a pain to update and/or install persistent applications or changes to the OS. It was Snowden's favorite tool and good for people on the run. as mentioned if you use a micro SD chip you can install it on there and swallow the chip if need be. TAILs biggest feature and one that i don't think was mentioned was that it prides itself on leaving no traces on the box where it is executing. this is because it builds a RAMDRIVE and everything runs from there. It also wipes RAM when it exits.",

Evolution Forums,BASICALLY,33082,2014-11-20T09:44:23,Re: Tor Project - TAILS for Dummies!,Security & Anonymity,"darkmilitia: After you've done this, everything you will save on your persistent volume will be saved on your USB stick, since the Persistent Volume IS your USB Stick. Nothing will be left on your system. if you throw your stick away, you have thrown away everything related with Tails. Also don't forget to reboot after you've done the step 6), otherwise your changes will not be stored.

It runs totally independant to the OS installed on the host PC and only uses the RAM (memory) from the host. Upon closing your current seeion using Tails, Tails will wipe the PC's RAM and leave no trace behind of Tails ever being used on the PC.    It is a much better option to use a host PC running a Linux distro rather than a PC with Windows installed. :).",Ho2T4rimo3 wrote:I know this tutorial is for Windows User ( which i am ) but its looks like its more safe on Linux ( Mint ? idk ) So is this tutorial still valuable if it is applied to a Linux system ?

The Tails dev's don't recommend the use of a VPN with Tails. Tails already comes with a cut down, pre-configured version of the TBB, all ready to go. It basically has everything a user could want for buying on a DM including it's own PGP Applet and a Electrum bitcoin wallet which comes installed and ready to use. You're best to read through all the Tails documentation found here -  https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html.  That will give you a detailed summary of what's included in the Tails .iso download and how to best use Tails, and all of it's features, whilst browsing on the deep web.  If you want to use a VPN or VM's, then look at using either Whonix or Qubes operating system.

Evolution Forums,Emmet,33082,2015-03-17T00:00:00,Re: Tor Project - TAILS for Dummies!,Security & Anonymity,"Mate, to be honest all your questions are answered on the Tails website. The Tails developers are the ones who don't recommend the use of a VPN with Tails. You can read more about it here -  https://tails.boum.org/support/faq/index.en.html#index17h2  If you insist on using a VPN, I'd be looking at Whonix or Qubes to use as my operating system instead of Tails.  Debian and Ubuntu are both good OS's to use on a host PC. If you do use Tails, then the operating system you choose is completely irrelevant because Tails runs independantly of any installed operating systems on the host PC. Once you boot into Tails and connect to a wired or wi-fi network (preferably using a Tor Bridge to do so), you can then start up the Tor Browser and connect to the Tor network. Tails comes with a built in MAC address spoofer (you just enable it when booting into Tails). If you're looking at fraud related activities such as carding, etc, the Tails is not the way to go however if you'll just be occassionally buying on a DM then Tails is a very capable and secure set-up as long as you learn how to use it safely. It's far from perfect but if you are aware of it's weaknesses and work around them, it can be a great option to use IMO.     Start reading all about Tails and how to get started here  -  https://tails.boum.org/getting_started/index.en.html","Ho2T4rimo3 wrote:Thank you again Emmet for your quick reply , i appreciatedI asked you for VPN because i see a lot of guides / discussions talking about a VPN before u connect your USB Tails , and another one before ( or after i dont remember ) the navigation on TorBrowser , so im a little bit surprised that you tell me VPN are not required for Tails :)I have just few questions and i leave you in peace mate , what is the best betwee Debian / Ubuntu ?

Evolution Forums,Emmet,33082,2015-03-17T00:00:00,Re: Tor Project - TAILS for Dummies!,Security & Anonymity,"Look at using a PC running Qubes. It offers you virtual isolation of Tor from applications as well as virtual isolation of applications from each other. FDE (Full Disk Encryption) is possible and  membership concealment (meaning someone watching your internet connection doesn't know you are using Tor) is possible by running a VPN inside a VM in Qubes. Qubes basically allows the user to create VM's to house certain applications in each one. One VM could be used for all your Tor applications, another may be used to keep your PGP applications and sensetive messages in and so on and so on. You can create as many as you need. Qubes has 3 VM's by default but you can add more if needed. It has one VM, named Dom0, which runs the Desktop Manager and is used for logging in. By default, it has no network connectivity, making it much harder for an attacker to remotely gain access to your system (and the fact that all applications are isolated from each other in VM's anyway). The only thing this set-up is lacking is physical (hardware based) isolation but this could be achieved with a router running Tor or an anonymous middle box running Tor. It will take you a while to figure this all out but please take your time and don't rush or cut any corners. Having an insecure set-up causing you problems such as potentially leaking your DNS settings or worse still, your real I.P address, is a mistake you can't afford to make.","Ho2T4rimo3 wrote:Very interesting sir , sorry for asking what may already be marked elsewhere but I prefered to have a confirmation by someone with more knowledge, but I will read all the links carefully.The only thing that bothers me is that you tell me that Tails is very not suitable for fraud activities, which poses a big problem for me because it is the goal of my research ...

Honestly if your looking for the best anonymous browsing solution the follow is probably it. #1 Laptop bought for cash in store #2 use a anonymous pre-paid  3G/4G mobile broadband sim/modem & change the IMEI on the 3G/4G modem. #3 Connect to double/triple/quad chained vpn server which you bought with bitcoin #5 Connect to hacked ssh server #6 Connect to hacked ssh server 2 #7 Connect to tor.

Mullvad you can pay with bit coins and buy as little as one day. but you want to hit there site from an anon connection like a public (not hacked) wifi. then to stay anon use your public wifi and your anon VPN then load TOR or whatever it is you need to complete what you are doing. Unless you are trying to break into Fort Know, TOR is probably good enough and if by some fluke it gets compromised you are still protected by your anon VPN (at Mullvad it's about $5/mo). i am not real well versed in the front end of a fraud config. you will probably need a socksifier and a socks 5 proxy. naked TOR nodes are on many blacklists and so you probably need a buffer. i suppose you could add another VPN to hide TOR.   now you say that you want the highest security possible. you can use VMs &/or Whonix for literally hundreds of different configs. you have TAILS. anyway many uses have a secure setup and then they fuck it up by running some application you thin is running under TOR, when in fact it isn't. as an example people get PGO encode messages all the time, so they fire up a PGP client and read the message while they are still logged into TOR. bad move. you should have a separate air gapped box that has never seen the web - and do all your crypting stuff there. with the latest Lenovo bombshell, your best bet may be to buy a bare bones system and install the OS yourself. i just bought two off of Tiger Direct for $150@. they have a license for WIN 7. i will remove that, probably install my own hard drive (i have several cases of 80 GB SATA drives - which are more than ample for everythin - except downloading large porn files) and re-install a clean version of WIN 7. with the Lenovo fiasco the culprit is low level. so it might be wise to reflash the BIOS as well. i'll add a couple of software packages, and sell them for $250. if anyone on here is interested send me a PM and i will create a custom listing for it. i can even set it up to your specs. some people may say it could ship compromised, but i have no interest in fucking somebody over, and it is much better than buying from a 3rd party who you have no idea what they may have loaded. highest security is a misnomer because different tasks call for different solutions.",

Evolution Forums,Nanners,52723,2015-03-10T20:57:19,Re: Tor by itself is not enough - Whats the highest security you can get?,Security & Anonymity,"If I lurk, I just first up TOR and don't bother with the rest, besides VPNing into one of my servers at best. Otherwise for sketchy shit I have a crappy laptop from which I scrapped the wifi chip, and that connects in 3G (dynamic IP). And then I just fire up something self-contained like a VM or a docker container packaged with my shit so I can have some fun. I don't see the point of chaining too much crap. You've got to be covered, not suffocating. The dream is chaining a proxy in a country everybody hates, like North Korea, Iran or England. Helps a lot keeping whatever authorities there are off your back.

Evolution Forums,Upload_Joe,52723,2015-03-10T22:38:16,Re: Tor by itself is not enough - Whats the highest security you can get?,Security & Anonymity,"Why VPN? In a lot of countries you can get an anonymous(well, pseudonymous) sim. Buy one with cash and use it only for DN/unpersonal stuff. Cellular network is slower, but the location can not exactly be determined. Change the sim + imei + mac and location from time to time. In combination with tails, i cannot think how they would get you only by using digital footprints. It is not more expensive than some VPNs i guess, but you can never trust a VPN, you have no knowledge about what it is logging.

It's important to keep the potential pool of people you belong too pretty large. it can very easily get small if you give enough data to cross-check. I'd generally advise against routing through servers you don't control directly.I personally use my own VPNs to plug into a better backbone than my actual line, not really to hide my IP (that's just a perk really).","Upload_Joe wrote:i cannot think how they would get you only by using digital footprints.;Upload_Joe wrote:It is not more expensive than some VPNs i guess, but you can never trust a VPN, you have no knowledge about what it is logging."

Evolution Forums,bundlebrot,246,2014-01-17T00:39:50,Re: Cracking wif passwords?,Security & Anonymity,"This is such a broad question. But here's how it basically works, so you have something to Google: * Make sure your card is compatible. There are lists online.* Place your card in monitor mode with airmon-ng* Check out SSIDs in the area with aircrack-ng* Dump packets from selected SSID using airodump-ng to a file* If the network is low traffic, you may need to send deauth packets to the AP using aireplay, to force handshakes* Process your dump file with something like coWPAtty There are a lot of variables, and password lists and tables etc can be several GBs in size and take a long time to process, and you may not even crack it. WPA isn't as easy as WEP was. Good luck.",

I didn't include any of those there, as it would definitely be a total lack of respect for other people's brains and hard work.  It is only resold stuff there, yet enough to save you good money until you figure out your path of choice here. After that, a quality vouched guide, focused on your niche of choice, from one of the many reliable vendors here, with full support, updates, etc, is a totally different thing, sometimes a must to get your stuff on the road asap... Just, like Yasuo, penissmith and many other seniors here keep telling you on daily basis, don't spend your money on bs and hypes... better buy 50 CVVs, burn 30 coz you're a total idiot, like I did/was lol, and then, you'll start scoring with the 31st for sure and never stop again as you learned from your own mistakes...

RDPs are, for sure, more advisable for PayPal (unless you know LONG-LASTING SOCKS5 providers which I never found).

Evolution Forums,InfiniteCom,42562,2015-01-12T07:29:51,Re: question about tails,Security & Anonymity,"I don't really see the problem if your HDD is almost new outta the box and you haven't done anything to it.I just dont go online when I use it. What's the harm? I'm curious as to why this would matter. I understand the advantage of being able to do -everything-  you need to do on TAILS, but what would compromise this by having an HDD in my machine? I've never even done a search on the thing, everything installed was directly from CD.  For how portable TAILS is, you can use it on any machine, and most machines have HDDs.  Maybe I'm missing something painfully obvious, so I suppose I'll remove it until I understand why this is a bad idea. An elaboration would be nice, since I was under the impression you could just pop tails into pretty much any machine you want, boot it, and get out once you've done what you need to do, assuming you manually boot from usb when the machine starts up. Since you're not writing to the HDD, where is the foul..? I figure an HDD with pictures of random shit and ""cool backgrounds"" isn't going to compromise me. If I'm mistaken, I would like to be educated on why. Not trying to sound arrogant, just trying to understand the concept.",

Tails with no HDD seems like a fun idea. I took my HDD out when I saw it (not like it had anything on it), and it does give me a feeling of being more secured.

Evolution Forums,quietForest,42562,2015-01-12T10:26:06,Re: question about tails,Security & Anonymity,"Having a HDD in the computer while using Tails would only be a problem if your Tails gets exploited and something malicious is written to the HDD to get around Tails amnesia. Everyone runs the exact same risk if using Tails with persistence, unless that persistent partition is mounted read only. Other than that there isn't really an issue. Tails runs entirely in RAM so the HDD isn't ever used. As with all such similiar questions, it depends on use case. I would think that most of the time a computer with a HDD in it and a 'normal' OS installed would appear less suspicious than a computer without one.",

I have heard many rumors that PAYPAL and possibly some other sites do. bu that is not to say that a persistant adversary  may not try to get to this information. now this is my question to you:  how does the HDD changer change the serial number? i seriously doubt that it is possible to actually physically change it - it can just spoof it. besides if it changed it permanently it would serve no purpose. so it probably alters the value that is returned by a Windows API call - which is perfectly logical. but suppose you adversary doesn't use that API call and reads it directly from the metal or the BIOS, then he gets a different number than the spoof. then you are probably worse off than having done nothing.    sure pull the HDD. - while you are at it use a burner hdd - instead of a burner laptop. to most activities on here you only need 10-20 GB if that - so you are talking $20.  i also use burner NICS (carry over from the days of hacking). i pick them up on sale at TgerDirect or Frys for $1-$5 on sale for wireless NICS. so if i need to do a critical mission i use one and toss it. just make sure to disable the onboard NIC first.",retroprd wrote:Remove your HDD - safest bet.

Evolution Forums,quietForest,42562,2015-01-17T08:32:25,Re: question about tails,Security & Anonymity,"My apologies folks, esp. to popa. Let me clarify what I meant, as what I said isn't exactly right. IF an admin password is set (I've met some people who use one every time), or IF another similiar exploit were to exist (I'm not 100% sure whether superuser is fully disabled when p/w is not set, and whether that can be gotten around, theoretically), then a malicious entity could mount any unencrypted partition on the HD, regardless of the RAMDRIVE use. What popa said about the RAMDRIVE is 100% correct, but Tails can still see HD partitions, same as the persistent partition, etc. Anyone can verify this by booting Tails with an admin p/w set and mounting an unencrypted HD partition (or an encrypted partition if you know the passphrase). The steps that Tails takes regarding persistence, as I understand, involve mounting the system partition from the Tails USB read-only, so any changes made get lost on restart. As to the HD, I don't know of any reason why a change wouldn't be persistent, but I can gladly test this.","popadoppalus wrote:bongos wrote:popadoppalus wrote:when you boot into TAILS from a USB stick, it creates a RAMDRIVE and everything runs on there. when you exit TAILS it wipes your memory clean - which is a good thing. one of its features is that it leaves no traces on your computer that it was ever there. this is to prevent wife or LE from discovering trace evidence of gambling or other illegal activities. the only OS running is the live Linux Debian distro on the stick. it can't even see the hard drive, i would like to get hold of an exploit that can access the HDD from TAILS. in any event if you pick up Malware while running TAILS it will only affect the RAMDRIVE and won't be present on the next boot. however windows keeps a record of every USB device that is inserted, so there is a trace, but not one that is worth much.You sure about this?

Evolution Forums,Prof,16780,2014-07-17T00:59:48,Re: [Reviewed] ***FREE*** easy to use tutorial to make money online,Guides Vendors,"Okay, so as MountainHigh as already given a detailed review I will be brief in my own, I agree with Mountainhigh on everything. The guide is well written and can be read quickly and understood on first reading. This guide definitely works as it is something I have tried on a very small scale before and there are profits to be made. It takes a lot of work and if you want cash within 24 hours this is not for you you're going to need a few weeks before you see the cash flowing. The main issue with this is a female partner is required. Other than that basic SE will get you through and you need to be able to talk to people. so if you are socially awkward this isn't for you.Overall it's a good guide with large possible profits if the time and effort are put in. This could definitely make you plenty of money but it should be treated as a full time job. Finally I'd like to thank Adhrann for providing me with a vouch copy and apologise for the late review.",

Evolution Forums,Yasuo,16780,2014-07-17T01:28:09,Re: [Reviewed] ***FREE*** easy to use tutorial to make money online,Guides Vendors,"Scamming? Hence the SE skill requirement. Meh. People make money through selling guides in the deep web. I guess this is so much better than people who sell guides that are on the first page of Google when you search the title of the guide they are selling. If you offer a service where you teach people how to instore(given they know basic SE and won't be nervous when they do it), I know you'll make good money. Given that you provide, probably, one of the best dumps in Evolution.",

Evolution Forums,spyker786,16780,2014-07-17T21:31:58,Re: [Reviewed] ***FREE*** easy to use tutorial to make money online,Guides Vendors,ok so this guide its alright it will make you money as the target audience is huge(you will be ripping off working people like some of yous). It will work if enough effort is put in with a female partner. The method is pretty old and popular i heard about it on the t.v long ago...The guide is well written i mean seriously great presentation. Every thing is spoon fed to you pretty much. its a method that will work for sure just dont believe its worth 0.2 btc as it is quite old and popular. This is my honest review of what i thought of the guide. Its a good money maker but morally wrong and unethical.,
Evolution Forums,Adhrann,16780,2014-07-17T22:16:55,Re: [Reviewed] ***FREE*** easy to use tutorial to make money online,Guides Vendors,"Everything correct, except for the 0.2 btc. The guide itself is 0.05 BTC, it was the 1 month tutoring included for 0.2 BTC   Indeed, it is morally wrong, but so is drugs, stealing people's identities, hacking into people's lives, and a lot of other stuff. Provided you are good enough to rip a multinational like Paypal, Amazon, etc, there is no use of doing this business, I totally agree with you on that one. On the other hand, though, if you are not able to do that, and really need money, this is an easy way of getting some, and then do what your ethic code is telling you to do, but not on an empty stomach... empty stomach and ethics rarely match. So, good for you, that you can afford to follow ethics while pretending you're a criminal, as others really can't.  Would I do this scheme now? NO, definitely not, as I am ok now, making decent money. Did I do it when I was hungry? YES, I did it many years back, for a short while, when I was broke... So, I guess it's just a matter of interpretation and context... Thank you for the honest review, I appreciate it

I keep reading here that there is a lot of people allegedly willing to do whatever it takes to make good money, yet still looking for a compatible path that could secure them a decent monthly wage.No, relax, the guide that I am offering you today is not going to teach you how to kill someone lol. Moreover, it has absolutely nothing to do with carding, Paypal, CCs, fullz, dumps, etc. So, if you are good with carding, Paypal, bank logins, or whatever other activity that is bringing you a steady monthly income of 5k or more, this is not for you.Yet, if you are neither making this money now, nor have a realistic projection that could secure you this income in the next future, you suck at carding, Paypal and stuff and don't like doing it, but you still feel you belong to the con world, first of all, just RELAX, as at least 80% of the people here are dealing with the exact same situation, and then you might consider using this tutorial, as this is going to bring you good money, while having a lot of fun by doing it. Yes, you heard me, fun has a lot to do with it. There is absolutely NO fucking question of whether you'll make money or not; the only question is just how much, and this is only up to you.

UPDATE1: Following to a GREAT private review (thank you andigatel, for that, it was one of the most professional and complete reviews I've ever read, even IRL; you and Yasuo are really the best reviewers ever), and his advice as well, I decided to release this guide for free in the market, as I promised I would in the first place if I considered  it right, and prepare a complete step by step business plan, with marketing solutions, scripts, scenarios, a lot of technical details, that will definitely make the difference, and enable even a complete idiot to make loads of money out of this scheme (this is, of course, provided that he doesn't have moral issues, and does not target the working class for this scam, as I read from someone here, as then, you will definitely grow old broke doing 9 to 5 lol)

Evolution Forums,Hackformoney,16780,2014-08-28T07:33:26,Re: [Reviewed] ***FREE*** easy to use tutorial to make money online,Guides Vendors,Done....Thanks,"Adhrann wrote:If so, you might want to read this:Good afternoon, EVO!I keep reading here that there is a lot of people allegedly willing to do whatever it takes to make good money, yet still looking for a compatible path that could secure them a decent monthly wage.No, relax, the guide that I am offering you today is not going to teach you how to kill someone lol. Moreover, it has absolutely nothing to do with carding, Paypal, CCs, fullz, dumps, etc.So, if you are good with carding, Paypal, bank logins, or whatever other activity that is bringing you a steady monthly income of 5k or more, this is not for you.Yet, if you are neither making this money now, nor have a realistic projection that could secure you this income in the next future, you suck at carding, Paypal and stuff and don't like doing it, but you still feel you belong to the con world, first of all, just RELAX, as at least 80% of the people here are dealing with the exact same situation, and then you might consider using this tutorial, as this is going to bring you good money, while having a lot of fun by doing it. Yes, you heard me, fun has a lot to do with it.There is absolutely NO fucking question of whether you'll make money or not; the only question is just how much, and this is only up to you. And I'm done talking, as it's starting to sound like hype lol.http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/26613Review no 1(Mountainhigh9):     ""I MUST SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GUIDES FOR THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN, IT IS REALLY EASY TO FOLLOW AND YOU DONT GET LOST WITHIN THE TEXT, ADHRANN KEEPS YOU UPDATED ALL THROUGHOUT THE GUIDE WITH HIS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WORDING AND EXAMPLES, YOU WILL NEVER GET LOST AND YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING FROM START TO FINISH (UNLESS YOUR A FUCKING RETARD - I CANNOT FAULT THE GUIDE) "" - see full review at #27Review no 2(Ozzyz): ""Hey, here is my review of the guide.The guide is not new, as I saw another user above post, but it is creative and can very easily be done with hard work and this guide. I won't go into too much detail, but it Does require a lot of input and SE skills! So although this method can actually be done by people who are new here, and are just starting out, I would recommend having experience with PC's and Social Engineering. Anyway as Adhrann said, if you do this right, you can make the money he stated above, however I must say, this guide requires a Hard Working Attitude, please don't buy this if you have no intention of investing a little time or money. However to conclude, this guide, Will make you money, and work, as long as you do exactly what it says, I have personally done this before, without the guide and have honestly made some serious money, but once again, know what your getting into.

The guide is well written and can be read quickly and understood on first reading. This guide definitely works as it is something I have tried on a very small scale before and there are profits to be made. It takes a lot of work and if you want cash within 24 hours this is not for you you're going to need a few weeks before you see the cash flowing. The main issue with this is a female partner is required. Other than that basic SE will get you through and you need to be able to talk to people. so if you are socially awkward this isn't for you.Overall it's a good guide with large possible profits if the time and effort are put in. This could definitely make you plenty of money but it should be treated as a full time job. Finally I'd like to thank Adhrann for providing me with a vouch copy and apologise for the late review.""Review no 5(spyker786):""ok so this guide its alright it will make you money as the target audience is huge(you will be ripping off working people like some of yous). It will work if enough effort is put in with a female partner. The method is pretty old and popular i heard about it on the t.v long ago...The guide is well written i mean seriously great presentation. Every thing is spoon fed to you pretty much. its a method that will work for sure just dont believe its worth 0.2 btc as it is quite old and popular.This is my honest review of what i thought of the guide. Its a good money maker but morally wrong and unethical.""More to come...UPDATE1: Following to a GREAT private review (thank you andigatel, for that, it was one of the most professional and complete reviews I've ever read, even IRL; you and Yasuo are really the best reviewers ever), and his advice as well, I decided to release this guide for free in the market, as I promised I would in the first place if I considered  it right, and prepare a complete step by step business plan, with marketing solutions, scripts, scenarios, a lot of technical details, that will definitely make the difference, and enable even a complete idiot to make loads of money out of this scheme (this is, of course, provided that he doesn't have moral issues, and does not target the working class for this scam, as I read from someone here, as then, you will definitely grow old broke doing 9 to 5 lol)"

Recently was selling some electronically deliverable goods. through a burner phone and PP.To Be brief -- Lets call the egoods 'master' -and the setup went -- email - registered to master,  then transfered from there to another person, used them, then receive payment on PP. Went smoothly.Then on PP, there is a dispute, saying 'etix' fraud contacted them, had my real info which I never gave, and confirmed everything. Then said do not contact him(me), and that they knew the info, and that they have been 'building a case'. Scary shit.So im wondering how long does it take for this to come? does master go to FBI and then they come after me? Should I close the PP? delete everything? I do have a contact number for this 'department' but it doesnt pull anything up. Any help appreciated!

Even though it was always a GVoice, or burner phone, never a real paypal or email. I normally use MoneyPak, but used PP after that got too complicated. So I have no idea.But she told them they had a case already, basically asked this new guy, and confimed every piece of info, and he said yes. So something could be brewing, do they come to my door? track my phone? wtf I travel a lot but they could still come find me. This chick who is in charge of fraud for ALL major sites like Master has a phone, FB and contact info everywhere. I wonder, this is a stupid perhaps, contact her saying im looking for me, what case do they have. Either way I wonder, do they immediately track all calls and texts, emails, everything?

If they were about to come get you, they would not bother explaining themselves to anyone, they would just do it, since they would not want to risk tipping you off. Cases like these depend on proving a chain of custody for the illegally obtained intellectual property, and they would not want you to come up clean in a search.  Sounds to me like they know its you, but do not yet have what they think they need to get to you. This might be a good time to clean house and move along.

Evolution Forums,ucard,13284,2014-06-13T15:11:28, ~ THE VERY BEST CARDERS AND GET MONEY GUIDE v4 ~ ,Guides Vendors,"http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/22127  Here is the most extensive,detailed and thorough CARDERS holy grail written by Alpha02. For those new to this game, alpha02 is a moderator over at TCF -TOR CARDIN FORUM-. He is the Godfather of ATO on the deepweb and have taken it to a whole different level.  If you still did not get it,I will rephrase it for you: He is the guy that was laughin all the way to the Mercedes car dealership suitcase full of money when you was still learnin what ""ccz"" means  He is now puttin out all his knowledge for everybody to learn and get better at this.        This guide is not intended for newbies only or advanced pros.It is for everybody that want to finally and actually want to see some $ comin their way. I have seen many times throughout the forums those sentences from frustrated members :                                                                          ""I burned all my ccz""                                                                             ""why can I not even get one order to get through""                                                                             ""I wasted all my money on years old useless tutorials""                                                                             ""Can I get some nice non avs bins""                                                                             ""This is so hard""                                                                              ""what is ATO how can I do it""                                                                                    Stop wastin your $ and time and learn the actual ropes. If you are already intermediate,or advanced,this will take you to the next level, carder 2.0.New techniques and methods come up all the time,if you do not catch up you get left behind.  See what the reputed members had to say about it:    All you guys do not know how much lucky you all are to have all those information directly made and prepared to learn from the best.You could not find this before,and a lot of personal research and readin had to be done.   http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/22127   ALL THE FEEDBACKS:                                                                                                                          nobody is to be held responsible for the consequences of your actions.For educational purposes,no crimes are condoned.

He really spoon feed us, It cannot be more clear, really after you read everything and understand the all process, if you contact alpha02 to get some support it s mean you are in the wrong bizz, and carding is not for you, just use your brain !!!!    His guide is about 100% SE so if you are uncomfortable with SE this tuto is not for you.    He s talking really about everything from step1 (how to protect yourself, how to get card who will work 100% to buy high amounts $$$$, and beat any security on your way. Until the last step, taking your items safely without getting caught).    I guarantee you if you follow step by step this guide you will make big $$$.    This is not easy method (I mean for lazy people hehe), you will need to make a big preparation for every website you will card, but it's hell of worth it.    This guide is more for US people, but worth to have it even for EU, Asia... , if you understand the process and have some ways to get the resource to get the info about the owner of your cards, you can use this method outside of the US easily. This guide is not just a method but it will learn you how the banks and other companies work and think about frauds, learn you to make fullz by yourself with just a regular cvv (even more than fullz hehe). You can make your own method (doesn t matter from which country you live) if you smart enough.    By the way this guide is not worth 50$, it should be really a lot more, he should t even sell it, he should keep it for himself hehe (we are lucky to have you alpha02). he is really generous on this one !!!!!!!    I really hope nobody will try to resell this guide, it will be a shame because this a real money maker again. But I'm sure some losers without balls will resell it :tantrum:    The last thing I will say, even if you are a newbie, you got some balls, you know how to talk on the phone, being patient and you are confident of yourself, you will have success for sure     I really consider myself to be lucky even if I paid for it. 50$ this is fucking free !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    HANDS UP FOR ALPHA02     mates hehehe;lot_oo7 wrote: if u wanna ATO with a very good PTO... i will recommend Alpha guide..

He had his ups and downs. Like everyone else, he also failed and was almost caught through a 3-way conference with the merchant and bank and still managed to pull it off. And he's just getting better and better. The best thing about alpha02 is he doesn't hog the information he knows. I mean, there are some secrets he will not tell you, but he helps you if he can.

I'm based in the EU and the guide was a huge, huge help to me. You can either browse this forum for months and pick up morsels of knowledge here and there, or you can get Alpha's guide which sets everything out perfectly. Alpha also includes details of the algorithm most merchants use to decide which orders are considered ""high risk"" and what you can do to lower that factor -- the chapter on that alone is worth the purchase price. Another excellent guide is ucard's drop guide, it's an ingenious idea and if you put some effort in - you'll never need to worry about another drop again.

Evolution Forums,dexterxtorm,13284,2014-08-03T15:20:09,Re:  ~ THE VERY BEST CARDERS AND GET MONEY GUIDE v4 ~ ,Guides Vendors,I just bought this guide. After a long time felt like I was reading something worthwhile. Was really tired of reading hastily written crappy guides all over Evo. This one has maybe 5-6 methods which are guaranteed to work when executed as described. Very few people write these guides from personal experience and knowledge but this one is a gem in the trough. Recommend to every carder wannabe out there. Bow to alpha02.,

Evolution Forums,nobodyenduser,18791,2014-08-28T07:49:01,Re: Place your PGP here and link to it in your sig!,Security & Anonymity,"UPDATE August 31st 2014Updated the new key that was signed. Apparently there was an error. I think it was because there was not a space after the end of the key. I've been using the same key for about a year and in that year I have learned alot especially regarding OPSEC. So I created a new 4096-bit PGP key to replace my old 2048-bit key. I signed my new key with the old key for easy verification. I will keep my old key for those who are not aware I haved upgraded however I prefer that anyone who wants to message me delete the old key and start using the new key.   Of course what initiallly made think about wanting to have a stronger encryption key was not actually OPSEC but size envy.

Evolution Forums,SeinUndZeit,18791,2014-12-21T17:45:30,Re: Place your PGP here and link to it in your sig!,Security & Anonymity,"So here's  a question - I'm relatively new to all of this ... as you see my forum profile is very new and my marketplace profile is relatively new.  As I was first setting up - I didn't appreciate that pgp message recipients and those importing my key would see the email associated with it (mainly because I was following the pgp client setup instead of broader, fully anon research). I had a mainstream email address associated with it that could theoretically be traceable. I sent a it to a couple vendors... and it was on my profile for a few days before I realized that the pgp email address should be anon. I have a new key, revoked the old one, updated profile and mailed updates to previous recipients.  I've corrected the problem, but is the damage done? Should I shut down and get an entirely new Evo account? I have some pending activity but nothing I couldn't walk away from.",

BT5 is the same only has issues with path and ENV vars. i recently read of some new shortcuts to cracking WPA & WPA2. you certainly find articles on google that explain the various methodologies. one thing for sure is that you are going to need a wireless NIC that is capable of running in promiscuous mode.  I have an ALPHA Network 1 that even has a screw on thing at the top so you can add an extra antenna. that will allow you to pick up the SSIDs of all in range wifis. then you use reaver or aircrack ng - or whatever new hack is out. it is not particularly difficult. but i am not sure that your slow wifi is not related to your system. personally i only crack wifi stuff for fun. whoever's router it is may well see you and sniff your traffic. for running any type of password crack by brute force or dictionary attack or whatever, the more RAM you have the faster you can crack it. how fast is your current broadband connection. if you are running streaming services like HBOGo or NetFlix, etc. it eats your band width. you may still be stuck with a 10baseT NIC or a  switch or even a router attached to you cable modem or not enough RAM to run your VM may be a bottleneck. i have noticed a large dropoff in my throughput around the holidays. i guess everybody is skyping or face booking, or face to face whatever that Apple thing is. my teenage granddaughter has been here for 2 days and has done nothing but stream stuff. i don't think she has said 2 words. i guess she doesn't have all that stuff at her house.",

Think about it for a minute, the eight numbers at the end of eircom (ie Eircon 1234 5678) define the password.

First, grab chapcrack https://github.com/moxie0/chapcrack/blob/master/README.mdThen when you have the token, submit it to cloudcracker https://www.cloudcracker.com/ For more information on Moxie Marlinspikes software, visit him at http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software.htmlInformation on the Cloudcracker FPGA cluster WPA2 cracking hardware project http://www.thoughtcrime.org/projects.html Chapcrack is a tool for parsing and decrypting MS-CHAPv2 network handshakes. For WPA2 Enterprise wireless handshakes, simply use a tool like FreeRADIUS-WPE in order to obtain 'challenge' and 'response' parameters. For a WPA2 handshake, run chapcrack.py radius -C <challenge> -R <response>, where challenge and response are what you intercepted with FreeRADIUS-WPE Cloudcracker is a 48 processor X 40 cores FPGA array cluster running at 450MHz that can run one DES operation per cycle/core. That's 18 billion operations a second. For 17 bucks they'll run it against 300 million attempts in 20 minutes. Or you could, you know, just try guessing. A lot.

Evolution Forums,popadoppalus,40430,2015-01-12T13:43:22,Re: could someone please tell me how to hack a WPA2-PSK wifi password,Security & Anonymity,"i would say that i have gotten into at least 50 routers with the default password. that is when i am at a box in the house behind the router. some routers nowadays have web interfaces with different passwords (which should always be disabled BTW, as they are subject to hack) then there is always the little hole for the paper clip that will reset the router password (and everything else) to factory default. many times you can get into a router with http://192.168.1.1, again from inside. these passwords are not necessarily the one needed to connect to the router. i personally think it is a waste of effort to hack wifi except as an academic exercise or unless you are just nosy, because once you get in the router you can get in the boxes behind it. besides if the OP has shitty service his neighbor probably does to. if not, he needs to switch ISP. but still Kali has tools for hacking routers and there are tons of tutorials out there - and i have never seen one that is a virus. besides everyone should be able to neutralize any malware on the box.  that guy at DEFCON made a necklace for his cat and he let it out for the nite and it came back the next morning with the passwords for 16 wifi networks in his neighborhood.  he had another cat that just went to sleep and came back with zero.","elmo666 wrote:popadoppalus wrote:well each home router has default password like admin or password, but it's usually changed. in the last couple years the big move has been toward web managed routers. presumably makes it easy to push out patches. that's a good thing because otherwise they don't get patched and holes get exploited. but on the other had having a web config control panel is vulnerable to  hacking.The router default password is only useful once you can access the wifi which is unlikely to be a default. The password to access the administration pages is different to that required to actually connect to the wifi"

On top of the dox, he constantly incited drama, had a few scam reports, cried whenever someone called him out on his bullshit, and attempted to bribe the Evolution staff. This was not a spontaneous decision: we have been consistently displeased by his actions, and yesterday he was given one final, stern warning to get his act together, which he only tried to fight with more cheap talk and apparently ignored. First's market account has not been banned, and at the current rate will not be banned as we have no reason to and he seems to be in good conduct. Thank you all for your understanding.

Evolution Forums,elmachico777,12076,2014-06-13T14:46:48,Re: OFFER NO LONGER AVAILABLE a,Guides Vendors,"received vouch copy. this is my review: The idea under this method is extremely good and it has high potential for sure. But this method is not for everyone and this is not a noob-friendly method of course. It is not compatible with stupid people, no brain people and people that want to earn everything in no time, investing no money (is that even possible?) Initial investment with this method is essential and really important but it has not to be necessarily too high. The method comes in pdf format, very well written, easy to understand and a lot of pictures in it to make it even easier to apply. It is very detailed and there are so much links and multiple examples for application. Web design skills are not necessarily required as the method shows you a way to solve that. What i think to make applying the method more easier: -Workgroup, making all of this with more people would be more easier-You have to spend time on this-You have to put effort on this-Brain and fantasy Price is good enogh considering the high potential of the method, and it is also set at that amount to put away time-wasters, no effort people and whatever retarded category people. however this is only my review because i received a vouch copy, for any further questions just ask via pm to charlesmf i totally recommend this if you are ok at becoming a great business man

A Marketplace that forces you to use the same nym on the Forums?,Security & Anonymity,"my friend, as i have made clear from the VERY beginning? i am OPEN TO DEBATE! ""please""?! but to answer your psuedo-question, well? it called Tor-traffic correlation/timing analysis. which is a ""very"" real thing (as i experienced myself). or you can read all about at https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#stayinganonymous bascially, after the fall of SRv1, we KNOW that (at least) the top 10% of Vendors were targets. as was i apperantly. so when you spend time posting on ""any"" given forum using the very same nym you Vend as? you make yourself a target. and it 'truly' doesn't take long for them to zero in on you. as i learned the ""hard"" way. they just order ONE package from you? then they have the city/state you are most likely operating from. then, if you spend alot of time on the forums related to the marketplace, on the same connection, using the same nym? (as many/most do?) you have just made it MUCH easier to get yourself 'de-anonymized'. like what happened to ""me"". i followed ALL other proper protocol (having been at this for over 10+ years just ""online""). and it was by spending too much time on the forums browsing/posting under the same nym i was Vending under, that got me de-anonymized. and the rest is history. as you should know by now. again. a GOOD vendor should ONLY spend 5-10 minutes 'online' per week, on a dedicated machine, 'physically' spoofing your MAC by using an 'external' usb card [without DMA], (as well as command line spoofing), running Tails ""Live"" on DVD-R, bulk downloading emails, ect with Tbird/Enigmail, saving pages of orders to HTML, transfering btc, ect...save to a flash drive...in 5 minutes flat. from random, rotating, 'off-camera'  public-wifi. and 'then', and only then, de/encrypt on a ""complety"" air-gapped set-up (as NSA whisteleblower William Benney has told us as well)....take the time to reply/re-encrypt 'offline/airgapped'. and ONLY then!? upload those emails/pms, transfer btc, download new orders, ect. in 5 minutes flat. perhaps using some war-driving? ""then""...fell free to go home, using a 'differnet' nym, and browse and post on ANY 'legal' forum you like....using DIFFERENT passwords as well! across aLL forums and marketplaces! to protect yourself from both scammers AND LE! cuz otherwise? your gonna get busted.  so learn from my mistakes? or don't? but you should NEVER be 'forced' to use the same nym on ANY marketplace as on the forums. let alone across marketplaces. i mean, would you advertise that you are selling illegal drugs in your local newspaper? so why would you put a target on your back? if it happened to me? it is happening to YOU! and you don't even know it! unless you REALLY know all about low-level boot-processes, hardware/software/browser exploits, snoopkitz, root/bootkits, ect.... period.onion so any plans for changes/security upgrades soon? peace mirage","Tempest wrote:No, I just got tired of arguing the point when you don't seem open to debate.In a security model, you trust your information relating to this pseudonym to the same party.

NO! and just a couple years ago i was nearly busted for 'this very reason'. you can search the Road forums. but long story short?  if you are a vendor? (or a buyer?) you should be spending the LEAST AMOUNT OF POSSIBLE TIME ONLINE COMMITING FELONIES! and even tho i followed ALL other proper protocol. (and i've been at this for 'quite' some time). it was because i used the same nym on the marketplace as a vendor. then spent way too much time on the forums using the same vendor nym. which allowed me to be root/snoop-kitted by tha feds. and de-anonymized thru Tor-traffic analysis. there is NO REASON you should be forced to use the same nym on the forum as on the market place! PERIOD! and there is NO other 'marketplace' that requires you to do this!!!  and DZF (Drug Zone Forum) was a honeypot set-up by the feds 5-6 years back. and they took all the vendors down. there are a ton of other marketplaces to choose from. and NONE of them have these requirements. so why you would you choose this one? it's a set-up! just sayin? go to the Hub: http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion and find 'any' other. that doesn't require you to this. make your self an easy target! they've done it before. it's nothing new my friend! this is the ONLY marketplace that does! just sayin? it's happened before. and they'll do it/are doing it again. it happened to me. and i'd (truly) hate to see it happen to anyone else. ever. so?...research? and...over and OUT of ""this"" place! peace mirage",

A Marketplace that forces you to use the same nym on the Forums?,Security & Anonymity,"I'm incredibly well-versed in privacy/anonymity software on both sides of the law. I fail to see how being forced to share a pseudonym across two sites owned by the same person exposes you to any additional risk.  As you point out, the biggest risk lies in if one of the two services is compromised, they have your( albeit, hashed ) password for both. Since you trust only one entity to keep that password secure, the admins of Evolution, across both sites, security is not impinged upon. Yes, if you decide to use the same pseudonyms and other relevant data( PGP keys, BTC addresses, etc ) across services, you are exposed to heightened risk. But that is not being forced upon you. Proper OPSEC is to have different pseudonyms on each service you use, with their own unique passwords, PGP keys, and other identifying marks. You should also never keep a pseudonym past becoming well-known in a community, as that means any LEA with access to the community also is actively trying to attack you.",

""MY Story""...and what happened because i spent FAR too much time on the SR forums using the same Vendor nym as i did on the marketplace. and having been at this for over 10 years 'online' alone, and following ALL other proper protocol? this was the ONLY way i was able to be de-anonymized. (also after, most likely, a package or 2 being ordered by the feds to locate the city i was operating from first). then some targetted traffic-analysis. and the VERY reason why you should NEVER use the same nym on them marketplace as on the forums. let alone accross marletplaces! and let alone be FORCED to!  and a GOOD vendor should only spend 5-10 minutes TOPS ""online"" per week. using a dedicated machine! and never expose their keys 'online'.

I also read that air gaped thing basicly airgaped is remove all internet wire and wifi from device correct? how do keyloggers get on your device to start? sorry for all the questions,M"" -------- (and as you may soon learn? i am far from a troll. and 'anything' but. i just REALLY care! so? read on....) -------- there are any number of way's. anything from a physical ""sneak n' peak"", direct trojan insertation/firewire DMA snoop, to (more likely) remote browser exploits, random ""firmware/OS updates"", ect. (like i recently received on my new Android? (hmmm...go figure?) since these ""updates"" do not actually exist in reality for my phone? according to both the Samsung website AND Samsung support staff!) hmm?....  but OSX Crisis (for example. which has the [goverment contracter's] ""Hacking Teams"", $250,000 a year code written all over it), was found a week later. but up until that point? there was NO known rootkit or trojan that existed on the planet with those capabilities for OSX. so i was like...uhhh?...wtf? and the closest one i found with those capabilities? (""OSX Crisis"") was found a week later. and it doesn't even require an Admin account to gain root privileges. just a user account. crazy! and therefore was able to gain low-level firmware (BIOS) as well as unlimited ""virtual"" persistance on my system! cuz your hardware/firmware? is really just software in disguise! microcode on your CPU, BIOS, ect. and anytime you download an OS/firmware update, ect? you are essentially just handing over control to root and granting 'whoever' full root access to your machine! which is why verifiying/checksums, ect are SO important to do! whether it be before installing Tails/TBB, or ""whatever""? as Peter Stuge says in the link below? ""Security starts many layers before the crypto!""...and this kit survived reboots, re-installs, 35x wipes, ect..on multiple machines, jumping drives, ect. it's a pretty crazy story. that i have yet to tell in full.  but to answer your question, i only found it cuz i was stripping apart OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) in an attempt to make a more ""secure"" version of OSX to run off a flashdrive, removing all location tracking capabilities, ect, and all other software level vulnerabilaties. and in the process of stripping it down? i got down to the ""bare bones""....and the rest is history. and after obversing the rootkit's behavior (thru sloppy logging, Activity Monitor, ect. cuz even ""they"" aren't 'perfect'. technology is progressing far too fast. even for them. especially when dealing with slumdogz like 'Hacking Team'/RCS (Remote Control Systems)...and so after a week or 2? i decided to fight back....! and before you knew it? i was literally fighting an agent in 'real-time'. taking down every attempt i made to disable it. disabling all my passwords, apps, little snitch, ect. one at a time. then i'd reboot/re-install, change passwords, ect..but i couldn't keep up! then (for the SECOND time in my life) there was suddenly a ""guest"" account"" on my login screen...and mobile ""Jetpack"" wi-fi networks abound! then i'd break out Disk Warrior, ect, watch it get disabled...watch my DVD drive switch from Magittsu to Fajitsu or whatever in 'real-time'. viewing all logs during any new installation, noticed the differences, (every install was getting ""remotely"" installed)...and any new install had the ""Send Registration to Apple"" (omg?...uh? thingy/link?) 'greyed-out'...and then after a couple daze of that? they just sent me to Single User mode, ect. leaving me to fight on command line (which was NOT my speciallty at the time). and things were starting to get VERY scary! i fianlly decided to call my mom. and all of a sudden every attempt to do so was cut off! i broke out a burner and got thru and told her what was up! (and ""immediatelly"" got a call back from some 'restricted' number yelling ""how long have you had this phone? where did you get it! ect... lol!)...it was literally like THE best feeling in the world! cuz by that time i had flushed everything...and they were SOOOO pissed that little ol' mirage had gotton one (or two? or 10?) over on them, lol...   then. until all of a sudden. they wiped (almost) all my drives clean. and every flash drive attached to my hub. (which the kit had been jumping to and from automatically). as i noticed by revelaing hidden files using Onyx, ect...but to the VERY end! i WON!  it was crazy/scary times. and a year before Snowden. and a week before OSX Crisis. and i ""really"" thought i was losing it.... but as we know now....that ain't nothin!  luckily i've been using macs since the mid-90's. and they sooner rather than later realized they had fucked with the ""wrong"" veganoid, lol....and just wiped (most) of my drives clean and gave up. but i gotz leftoverz. and so do trusted friends. and so does the ACLU. and we're workin on it! and as i mentioned, (all in this timeframe) Apple support staff straight up addmitted to me TWICE that they had backdoors for the NSA! so take it or leave it! i'm workin on gettin those phone calls!  or just? run Tails ""Live"" on DVD-R when commiting felonies? regarless of the hardware you are using. although you really should be flashing your BIOS to Coreboot and physically soldering/'write-protecting' it if you truly wanna stay safe from such Alphabet Snoopkits!  ""Hardening hardware and choosing a #goodBIOS [30c3] ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VvR-vsdMlQ i truly feel it was only intended to be be spyware. used to collect evidence, ect, and not intended to be found. and good rootkits aren't intended to be found. that's why they are ""snoopkits""...spyware...perhaps just run bare bones linux? or Tails, ect. (litterally) on a Raspberry Pi Model A? and do some research...or ur truly fukt!  cuz Tor alone will NOT protect you. or GPG (if you're not decrypting ""offline""/'air-gapped'. and i 'know' how i was de-anonymized. as i have made VERY clear both here and elsewhere. by using the same Vendor nym on the marketplace as on the forums! let alone across marketplaces! targettted Tor-traffic analysis is a VERY real thing! and i ""really"" wish Vendors at least would listen up! cuz i ""truly"" care yo!  just ""Be prepared!""

A Marketplace that forces you to use the same nym on the Forums?,Security & Anonymity,"No, I just got tired of arguing the point when you don't seem open to debate. In a security model, you trust your information relating to this pseudonym to the same party. Therefore, you do not incur any further risk by sharing the pseudonym across two websites hosted and ran by the same entity than you would from only having that pseudonym on one of the two sites operated by that entity. Just because others don't do it doesn't mean they have a good reason for doing so.   Disregarding a security model, please, do tell, how does you sharing the same pseudonym across two hidden services( we'll assume for the sake of argument they have different servers and levels of security ) alter the ability to trace back a given connection to a user? By the very nature of the Tor network, every individual connection is just as hard to track back as another.

Evolution Forums,bitblender2,42005,2015-01-09T06:54:14,Re: How to actually make BTC untraceable?,Security & Anonymity,"The Best-Practice guide on the start page of Bitcoin Blender mentions these three important things: 1. Deposit to Multiple AddressesBitcoin Blender makes available the ability to split your deposit up between five bitcoin addresses at once. If an interested party is attempting to locate your deposit of 50 BTC, their task is made exponentially more difficult because they must attempt to locate up to five deposits or more of varying amounts that may or may not add up to 50 BTC. 2. Delay Your WithdrawalsIf someone is watching the blockchain and they notice a transaction for 100 BTC at 4:30 followed by another transaction of 98 BTC at 5:00, they might suspect this is a part of the same trail - even if there is no hardcore evidence. By waiting several hours, days or even weeks, you are further distancing yourself from association with the coins you wish to mix. 3. Withdraw to Multiple AddressesBy the same token, if you deposit 100 BTC and withdraw 98 BTC to a single address, this may give somebody watching the blockchain reason to suspect it is part of the same trail. By making multiple withdrawals to different addresses generated by different wallets over a long period of time, you are further improving your anonymity. Bitcoin Blender makes this simple by allowing you to schedule your withdrawals for points in the future, so the task of mixing can be accomplished during a single session. Entering more than one address when withdrawing will randomize the amounts and delays between each address making it impossible to prove there is a link to your original coins. If you follow these three points there will be no way to link your Blender Deposits to your Blender Withdraws. Some days there are more than 100 000 bitcoin transactions, if you use high delays and withdraw to multiple different wallets there is going to be too many transaction combinations on one day alone to statistically link it to your original coins, there are too many matches. If you dont withdraw to multiple addresses the randomized delay should be higher, maybe 12-24 or 24-48 hours depending on the amount. There should be as many other transactions on the blockchain as possible within the 1-3% range of your deposit between your Deposit and your Withdraw time range.  Hope its easy to understand, if there are any questions ill try to answer.  Best regards,Bitblender",

I think IF this person was able to do it, they would have to take a REALLY long time in order to wash all of the coins through tumblers and then slowly cash it out.

Only $15!,Guides Vendors,"received vouch copy. i say sorry to ohman1988 again for being too late in this. this is my review: the method comes in word format, very well written with details and a nice amount of pages. this method will teach you how to use almost every PPD in your own way to get money from those. it is written step by step and everyone could understand and apply easily. anyway if you have some informatic knowledge by yourself that would help more, but it is not necessary as ohman1988 really explain how setup everything easily in this. in this method you will also find some tricks useful for some other methods (example: free cc method included). the method includes also some links of the most used PPD for applying this on them and the one that ohman1988 uses himself. i recommend this method to everyone that want to make money just doing some action in front of their computer, nothing more. this method is worth the money and will let you earn some money, not huge amounts but some nice money per time for sure and you can apply this and repeat everytime you want. i also add that ohman1988 is a really nice guy, easy to deal with, almost on through day for help and he will support you on everything and nicely. definitely recommended, thanks ohman1988!! however this is only my review because i received a vouch copy. for any further informations or questions about the method just send a private message to ohman1988, he will answer you in a moment with details.

Good service ohman however last guide requires quite a decent computer at minimumn to get a proper return which isnt a prob just mine is shit and would have been good to list that. Also if the web page doesnt load correctly it will not count as logged in. Once again very good guide mate and it seems your just starting making them so well done. Just try and list more detail if you can it will help. I will be buying more guides from you in the future.",

If they video doesn't load you're fine and gaining, if the meters on the right side aren't ticking then you're not gaining!! You should try using Chrome like I said in the guide, that way you can follow my instructions and disable adobe flash in chrome which actually turns off the chat and the video, but you still gain in the process!",

Evolution Forums,iSellGuides,13252,2014-07-22T11:49:05,Re: Earn easy money with pay per download sites! Only $15!,Guides Vendors,"Ohman, are you reselling this method? EDIT: I'd like to point out that there's a difference between reselling the exactly same guide mentioned by RReddington or improving/testing/detailing the guide and reselling it here for a small fee. I'm still convinced people on here are expecting too much of $15 guides.. Do you really think that we ( me & ohman ) are discovering new methods that has never been publicly shared?? C'mon, you should look at the prices we're selling our guides.  If buyers are really interested in a UNIQUE method, deposit $100 - $200 to Evo and I'm sure you'll be satisfied. If you're not willing to spend that amount, the best you can do is buy guides from a trusted vendor and make sure the guide is updated,improved and more detailed then you can find on the clearnet. Only then, $15 is a good price, otherwise people should ask to refund.

And you realy have to keep in mind that the BTC trading community is getting bigger and bigger every day, and theres always comming new sellers/buyers to the online trading places like LBC, OTC etc. and you aaaaall know how mutch gullible people there is out there. and 4 the googeling parti would say this scam is based on the inpuls buy stategi, when the contact is established you use 1 tool, to do 1 single action, and then the transaction is on the way to your wallet... yes you have to find the rigt sucker. but belive u me, they are out there in numbers  if not you can buy a facebook/twitter like/followers hack to get all from 100.000 followers/likes - 1.000.000 - so this istaking the operation to the next level. the more you prepear and use my steps in the method, the bigger the chanse 4 a big payday. i think that a hustle is a hustle, as long as theres is cash in it, im there bro .",

Evolution Forums,mistertforever,9817,2014-05-16T14:06:56,Re: Localbitcoins scamVOUCHED METHOD50$comin soon,Guides Vendors,"This method requires you to purchase a premium plan on a website, so, for what I understand, unless you're into carding or have access to any anon visa, there's no way you'll be able to use the method without giving out your personal info. And if you have to purchase some kind of anon visa, expect an investment of at least ¬60 to ¬80, that's a price I got from card sellers here on the market. DO NOTICE you'll only be able to pay it with a VISA card or MASTERCARD! Any other solution is useless. These are the only payment options there, no way around.All suggestions given to me won't work, okpay, paysafe, greendot (unless you're in the US), are a no go.Assuming Spendon is in fact a Visa card (which I do not know), it will cost you a minimum price of ¬70. Of course, you won't have a problem if you're not worried about your anonymity, and go all crazy using your own CC. Side note: Creating a domain outside the referred website (like I did, because of its cheaper price) will be useless, cause when you try to connect it to your phishing site, it will tell you that ""Connecting a domain to your site is a premium feature"", meaning you will still have to purchase that premium plan anyway, so no use in doing that.

Evolution Forums,elmachico777,9817,2014-05-12T18:38:13,Re: Localbitcoins scamVOUCHED METHOD50$comin soon,Guides Vendors,"i got a vouch copy and i'll do a little review here.  i have not tried the method yet, but i can assure you all that there are no reasons for this method to not work. it seems that it's impossible to be saturated also   this method is all about SE skills and a bit of luck. in the first place you have to pay a little investment (15usd) but that's not a problem since you can get any amount of bitcoins applying the method. you have also to be a little creative since web designing is involved in a first step. nothing to be scared about, even a kid can make a website with the link there is in the method. plus highasakite is a really friendly vendor and he can help you throught this little important step. after you made your site it's almost done, just go to the victims place and pray god you find a good chicken  SUMMARIZING: -REQUIREMENTS: web designing basics (you can have 0 skills but the more you have it the more the sucess you'll have), a bit of SE, luckyness.-METHOD: will work, 0 possibilities that it won't work. will never saturate. easy and noob-friendly method.-VENDOR: highasakite is really a friendly vendor, really fast replying you pms and very concerned in helping you about applying his method.-PRICE: totally honest. this method is about a 10 step text file, 8 dollars is rightly is value.

I have paysafe in my country, but it's not a visa, it only gives you a 16 digit pin you can use to purchase stuff on sites that specifically  accept ""paysafe"".Spendon is another thing, and I don't have it available here. So wich one did you use? SpendOn or Paysafe? And so, okpay is not visa then? ""spendon as well as OKpay IS visa""",

I am looking to order small amounts of weed for personal use, but am currently living in a hotel. I don't do any carding (and if that's where you order items on other people's credit cards, then shame on all of you), so this won't be for profit. Is this something that is going to involve spending a lot of money, finding a hobo to rent a trailer in his name, etc... Or is this something fairly simply for ordering an OZ of weed every couple/few months. Also, I am somewhat handicapped, so have a hard time getting around. Does it involve a lot of leg work?

Evolution Forums,UKheis39,80,2014-10-24T12:26:14,Re: GET YOUR OWN ITEM/MAIL DROP TUTORIAL:USA UK EU INTERNATIONAL,Guides Vendors,"***Review*** I purchased the guide yesterday and base this being in the UK. Ucard mentions a couple of ways to have/use drops, however he focuses on one way to ascertain a drop. Now this is NEW and I have not seen it noted before, I will not disclose it as it's unfair and you have to buy the guide.  Now I feel this will work better in the US than the UK. He does give advice for the UK which makes total sense. Would it work?? Yes, it will need some work and if you followed it to the letter, is 100% anonymous, however as said it would need some work and is more difficult in the UK. I wouldnt feel overly comfortable doing it that way. However, it has given me an idea on how I can adapt it for me. Thanks ucard.",

I highly recommend this guide if you are serious and have the brains to make it work (again nothing hard, just requires you to be smart). it gave me plenty of extra ideas to improve it. looking forward for the new version.",

TL:DR i always have some worries about this method. i know, my friend ucard's positive feedbacks and claims about his way. especially,  - ""THIS GUIDE WORKS  INTERNATIONALLY (unless you live in the desert or mountain)"" but i still have some worries. the postman like a chairman in here. i can't go to post offices because in there there're more chairmans. i'm following your thread for 2 months ucard  so i'm no time-waster. i just don't want to spend my money for an empty hint!  do you think your guide works for guarded areas for id verification without having new id or new houses?",

I know buying BTC is legal and I could also mix the coins, but I would like to stay anonymous in all steps of purchasing coins to purchasing drugs.   I used to purchase at CampBX with a money order (anonymous) but they don't seem trustworthy anymore if they are even still around.

The vendor is both on agora and evolution, but my most recent order, i place it on evolution because of the down time of agora at the time (and i have ordered from him on evo before so i know its him) but i mostly order from him on agora.  I place the order 2/16 which was presidents day so no shipping, so he told me he would ship next day which he did, well at least he marked it shipped the next day.  4 days go by and nothing comes so i get slightly suspicious because every order in the past was received in 48 hours after placing order and never more. He only ships priorty shipping 1 to 3 days. So i send a message asking for the tracking just to see whats up because im always a little paranoid when it comes to this stuff.  He dosent answer till 2 days later saying he will check it out when he gets to his office and send me an update right away. (on the 2/23)  Sent him one more message yesterday saying im still waiting on the tracking number he promised but the same day he post an update on his page that hes going on vacation mode for a week or so and no responses to my messages. Even though i saw he was online all three days after he said he would send me tracking  Its 2/27 now and its still hasn't come. Im not doubting this vendor,he one of the fastest vendors ive ever delt with on the DNM but his communication has been slow on this problem and i find it weird that he just went on vacation mode before at least sending the tracking to see whats up.  im still in escrow of course  i just want to see if he even shipped it? if it was a shipping mistake? and most importantly did it get intercepted?  whats your guys thoughts, too early to worry or should i dispute this because it says it will auto finalize in 3 days

Evolution Forums,postmanbutters,52680,2015-02-28T20:30:36,Re: Did my package get seized?,Security & Anonymity,tldr; You bought something and it hasn't come yet. (For future reference please don't double space each sentence) Open up a dispute if the vendor won't give you a tracking number and the parcel hasn't arrived yet. Your package could've easily been snatched by LE if you're ordering international.,
Evolution Forums,JuzJenny,52680,2015-03-01T04:59:50,Re: Did my package get seized?,Security & Anonymity,"Usual 2 day delivery would indicate domestic vendor, I think you should 100% dispute before the auto finalize.

Evolution Forums,SniperFox,4112,2014-03-10T20:30:39,"Re: Buy btc with credit card, not fake guide",Guides Vendors,"Well the method was sent to 2 x people who both have said that it works, granted the chances are low, but it works. Those are the risks you take in carding. I would put it down to either your skills as a carder (setup, socks etc) or the cards you are using. I would try to fix both ASAP and try again. I am unable to deal with disputes within the marketplace, only admins are able to do this. But my opinion is that your formula isn't quite correct Sierra.  That being said, $200 for a method that has a low success rate and requires a lot of specifics is over priced, especially being a ""one liner"". For $200 I'd expect an moderately in depth guide with plenty of food for thought. OP I would consider a partial refund as a gesture of good will and part ways with Sierra. I would also work on improving your ""guide"". One sentence, one paragraph for that matter cannot be considered a guide. SF",

Yeah, i can get engine running with few kicks and ride few kilometers. The car works, but are we considering that 'working'? Edit: i am sure of my setup, i was running it earlier. I used cards from iSellPizza, what is basically best here, and it didn't work. I used cards that i was given by OP, and it didn't work either. It's logical to assume that he had high interest of giving me good cards to try the 'method' again.

I'm glad i didn't released escrow yet, and i hope to get admin's help getting my money back. This guy said it works with ALL cards. So i bought SOCKS5, and 8 cards from iSellPizza. I get verification by vica. Now this dude says that it only works with non-vbv cards. I buy two non-vbv's from him, and he's so retarded, that he send's me link of the btc shop again. After shitload of messages, i get my two cards. They have no addresses, so i can't apply socks (he said socks is required). Then he got me another two cards. You know what? I got verification by visa again. I bought SSN from ssnfinder.ru, and it didn't work. Other card asked me for password what i obviously cannot know. I tried to be peaceful with him, but that's what i got to do after number of warnings for him.Why i write here and don't open a dispute? because that fucktard marked his guide as physical product, and now i have to wait it to get 'shipped'.

That being said, if OP is willing to let me take a look I'd be more than happy to do so.

Evolution Forums,Yasuo,4112,2014-03-11T11:03:04,"Re: Buy btc with credit card, not fake guide",Guides Vendors,"I guess it will still work. However, the original post stated that there are no needs for any sort of documents, which is totally misleading for the purchasers. I do think that SierraRomeo deserves his moneyback, not because the method doesn't work(it does work), but because the initial information given was misleading. If you do provide the documents, you're easily looking at $100BTC for 1 Pizza. @SierraRomeo, if you only need these documents, don't you offer this as a service? You can easily make bank if you have the right cards. EDIT: Given that SierraRomeo was able to look at the site given by OP, I don't think a full refund is necessary. Half will do. Since half is $100, if he has the right resources and is doing it at the right time, 1 pizza should be enough to cover the initial investment.

I must say it's pretty unique even though I've heard of stuff like this but totally different. It involves a drop obviously needed, possibly a fake id and just some good SE skills. I won't go into detail but it's pretty simple. This method will work and is defiantly worth the money. You can get your money back within a couple days or even more then that. And keep going up and up. 50k a day? Nah I don't think so. But possibly a few thousand a day if you really work. This is a pretty straight forward method and isn't that complicated. But some users might find it harder then others. Honestly I might try this method out once I get a new drop. It doesn't seem too complicated to me. It takes some money to invest but not much at all. I'm giving this a 4/5 because it can be rather hard for some users but you'll defiantly make your money back no problem. Also if you aren't good at SEing I suggest not buying it but it also doesn't take much SEing. Just gotta be straight forward and you'll get the hang of it. I suggest this guide honestly.Review: 4/5",

UNLIMITED DROPS  Unless you're way in fucking arkansas somewhere. Presh the review bro.,"Trippyy wrote:Alright well I just received a vouch copy regarding this guide. I must say it's pretty unique even though I've heard of stuff like this but totally different. It involves a drop obviously needed, possibly a fake id and just some good SE skills. I won't go into detail but it's pretty simple. This method will work and is defiantly worth the money. You can get your money back within a couple days or even more then that. And keep going up and up. 50k a day? Nah I don't think so. But possibly a few thousand a day if you really work. This is a pretty straight forward method and isn't that complicated. But some users might find it harder then others. Honestly I might try this method out once I get a new drop. It doesn't seem too complicated to me. It takes some money to invest but not much at all.

This guide is a quick read at just 2 1/2 pages, however, don't let thatfool you into thinking the content is lacking. Omerta lays out a way foryou to make very good money if you're willing to put in some work. I'll just go ahead and say this now. If you're lazy, forget it. To me, thisis not hard work at all. But being around some of you on this forum and readingall the whining, that tells me that many of you are not serious about making moneyand/or you still live in your parent's basement. You act like it's impossible to outsource this shit to someone on CL, Fiverr (hey they take BTC now) etc if you're uber lazy. It'snot like they need to know all the details to help you   Sorry /rant. So anyway, since I only received the guide last night, I obviously haven't had time to put anything in motion, but that will change in a few hours after I get everything setup. So how do we turn ""$81 into $2,000"" every day, over and over? Without giving the method away,here is the best description I can give for what you have to do: 1. Purchase a profile off Evo (I think he means fullz and background check? I'll need to clarify)2. Get your drop. He explains how.3. Setup an email for the person you bought fullz/bc for.4. Signup on a certain website and deposit $20. Easy.5. Make a phone call to the sales department of the site that's used for this method and order the items.6. Call again. Have a little conversation. This is the SE part, but it doesn't seem difficult really.7. Items are sent overnight to your drop for free.8. Boom. The items you're ordering are popular and will be easy to resell the same day/hour. If you need help, Omerta says ""24/7 support through icq. I will not spoon feed you. This is not hard, but I will help you out ONE good time. After that its all repetition."" So it's good to know he'll help out if I get stuck on something. I also like that Omerta included a link to an order he had completed just on 8/18. I looked up the tracking # and sure enough, the items were sent overnight to the address he used as the drop lol. Recommended? YES. The vendor's initial hype of making $50k a day with this might have put many people off.but seriously, I don't see how you can't make a few thousand a week doing this. Milk this and fund your otherprojects or pay your bills  Suggestions to Vendor: Read over your guide and clean it up a bit. A few parts may not be clear to some, and thereare a few typos and spelling errors. It should be presented better at this price tag.   Price at Time of Review: $350 (I see the price was lowered now to $120).

Easy for Aussies!! 1- Get together about 13 thousand bucks. 2- Set up a drop 3- Import at least 100 grams of Meth (as much as you can get your hands on with the 13k). 4 - Retrieve your meth and sell on evo, making a sweet 50k + profit 5- Repeat Daily, ordering 13k of meth every day and you will make at-least 18 million a year. This method is gold, don't worry if you fuck up because you will never have to worry about rent again, the government will cover it for you!! You will get a nice comfy jail cell, free of charge for the rest of your life, gay molester included. No really this is a really good method to make some cash, a bit of risk but well worth it and for fuck sake you don't need 18 million a year.... Stay small, enough to cover rent food and a hooker a month, staying under the radar, import 18 million per year worth and you will become the Aussie Meth Drug King Pin, #1 on AFP's wanted list.

As long as you're in a decent sized city. to make 3k per day you will need about hour and half of your time. and then the next morning maybe 30 mins of time picking up shit. I have used the same address twice, but thats only cus I was in jam. I'd never do again. Especially since I was sleeping there that night. But yeah. After you buy hit me up on icq and I'll answer any questions."

I guess I cannot give an official review with an actual outcome here. But I'll give you my thoughts.1. The guide focuses geographically in the USA. However, this is an exploit which will be fixed soon. It's like the Xbox One rape before.2. If you really read the guide, you can apply it on the country you're in. However, on my location, there's no company that has a similar service.3. The guide focuses and relies on your social engineering skills. You don't have to be the best social engineer to get your ROI and get a daily supply of this.4. Guaranteed money maker if you do it right and you time everything well.There's a site that makes this really really easy. Right now, the guide requires a bit of physical activity(acquiring the goods). ROI should be on your first set of shipment."

It's much more readable. No problem with format now Guide is written good enough, so even beginner or non-native english speaker should understand. If you need to transfer your BTC to anon account, it's worth it. It even worth it if you have some stolen EU IBAN. Personally, I haven't tried it yet because I don't have any back account available, but the site is legit and I believe this guide is legit too. Lol. Nope, it's not. Maybe they will need some ID when buying BTC, but for selling them, it's totally legit.

Personally, I haven't tried it yet because I don't have any back account available, but the site is legit and I believe this guide is legit too.So, is it scam?Lol. Nope, it's not. Maybe they will need some ID when buying BTC, but for selling them, it's totally legit."

This guide is one of the most powerful things on this forums, will include a lot of stuffs which can lead you to make a lot of money! Main reason why I release this is because it wont get saturated or burned and I will only sell 10 copies.  You might think this is much for a guide. But before you please think about it. I will provide a full and detailed guide and mentoring you on how to make refunds, these method can be used on everything on amazon. Lets calculate for a bit. Lets say we are going to make a easy double dip on a PS4.          [-] How to get a refund.[-] How to get a replacement.[-] How to double dip.[-] How to get unblacklisted[-] How to transfer gift card balance.[-] Pictures, scripts that you will tell them.[-] How to refund amazon lockers.[-] How to refund even if you signed for the package.[-] How to skip investigations.[-] bonuses   I will be helping you as a mentor, I will answer all you questions and tell you what do say if you don't know what to tell them. You can tell me a time when you want to make the refund and I'm going to try to be online at that time and help you out with your refund, by telling you what to say if you don't feel confident to do it by your own.  If you got any questions about the guide, feel free to message me.  I will still offering my amazon refund service.
 Last edited by lokmannen (2015-01-22 10:33:21)","Price: 150$;2xPS4 = 800 dollar
My guide = 150 dollar

Lets say you will sell those 2 PS4 for 600 dollar. You just earned you money back + 450 in your pocket.

THE METHOD SEEMS LEGIT BUT WITH SOME DOWNSIDES (SEE BELOW) RUNNERS OR BANK DROP REQUIRED WHICH IS NORMAL BUT BANK DROP GETS BLACKLISTED AFTER 2 TRANSACTIONS SO NOT REALLY WORTH IT (MOST MENTIONED IN THE GUIDE IS $350 PER TRANSACTION) WITH SOME EXTRA TIME THIS METHOD COULD ACTUALLY BE A NICE EARNER, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR USING RUNNERS - I WOULD NOT SUGGEST PEOPLE DOING THIS WITH BANK DROPS AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE DROP GETS BLACKLISTED AFTER 2 TRANSACTIONS...

I had been making a decent amount with it but I have had to refund EVERYBODY (close to £2500) because Gold has refused to help me. I am out 1BTC because I am a sucker for marketing. He is nothing more than a Steve Jobs for the dark net markets. All magical but delivers false dreams. Lord have mercy.... On another note has anybody given him your torchats. He claimed to ask for mine when disputing the purchase because of the listing. He promised a free method... Nothing. He offers a refund if you do not make bank within 3 weeks... Zilch

Evolution Forums,Gold,3088,2014-02-23T19:00:35,Private Carding [1 BTC][4 LEFT],Guides Vendors,"Evolution, As many are likely to have noticed, I have taken the past few weeks off and have distanced myself in order to allocate my time to a personal venture. This venture was in fact a discovered method that I decided to personally monetize from. Now, it's your turn. For those of you that have been here since the start, I'm in hope that through my previous private method, I have proved myself. I received an immense amount of positive feedback and not once did I receive negative feedback.  Proof: https://anonfiles.com/file/41f54448fea287e208c0075e2457159f Requirements The requirements aren't as simple as my previous method, however, the method in itself is far more sustainable and expandable to a higher value. - Non-hacked verified PayPal account, with a working bank account attached (Available on Evo)- CCV data- The ability to card products - I provide a free vulnerability in a chain of payment processors which allows you to card items with high values.  Everything needed is described in-depth, retrieving them will be no issue.  Potential During my tests, I was comfortably clearing 2K a week with minimal effort. I capped further expansion to prevent popping up on any radars, as of course, this is a constant worry for those fraudsters turning over large amounts of fiat currency. This method will put thousands into your drop bank account, weekly, if that's what you wish to do. From there I cover methods in which these funds can be converted into BTC or into physical currency.  Price: 1 BTC (Relative to the currently cheap BTC value)Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/3704 To further prove my faith in this method, If a problem occurs and you do not make your money back within 3 weeks, I will refund your order amount.This is a GUARANTEED way to make profit, it's as simple as that. FAQ Why is the price so high? - The pricing is based on what this provides, there's a constant circulation of cheap and half working methods which can return a nice revenue. However, these methods are not sustainable and not expandable. What I'm selling will only belong to 10 users, by doing this I prevent saturation and leaking. By taking sustainability into account a true profit projection can be calculated accurately, basing this on my gains, In 10 weeks you could have £20,000 in Bitcoins, that is all the price justification needed.   Does this involve physical items? - Yes, however you will not once need to touch or be anywhere near these products. No drop address is required either. The operation manipulates the process of physical eCommerce, it is however an entirely virtual operation.  What if this method is leaked and saturated? - Though my selling method is against this happening, it's always a possibility. However, There is no solo victim involved with this operation, the losses can be distributed between multiple companies which means the method is somewhat proofed from saturation. There is one small variable that can make life harder, however, this is unlikely to ever occur.  Can I have a vouch copy? - I've supplied vouch copies to some users already, they'll be leaving reviews shortly. This will not be an ongoing thing, I know that there is a demand for these methods and therefore have no need to release more vouch copies in order to increase sales.

The method has been tested several times in the UK and the USA. It can be applied WORLDWIDE I believe. The method DOES NOT INVOLVE carding - no usage of personal information. It works like this:1. You phone with order you want and address you want delivered to (you have to input mobile number as well) [my method does its magic here] 2. Domino's reply the order has been taken3.

Evolution Forums,thegifter,38487,2014-12-17T21:47:38,[VOUCHED] TG - Paypal DOUBLEUP Guide - V1.0,Guides Vendors,"|||| I am a well known Amazon refunder on here with a highly rate guide - all of my methods are unique. This new method, using Paypal that I have been utilising has alone provided me with thousands over the months and has allowed me to augment the money that I have been earning ||||  STOP relying on inconsistent Paypal transfers on here, which can result in chargebacks and limitations and take control of your own Paypal earning scheme.  This is a comprehensive 6,000+ word guide consisting of 35 pages, including detailed descriptions for completing each part of the process. This is not a public guide and has been purely written by me through hundred of hours of work.   - Full setup of Paypal sender drops and receiver drop accounts- Step by step methods to multiplying funds- Advanced methods for further increasing of funds- Concise, thorough steps > Get earning immediately- much more covered...     My previous guide ""TG's Repeat Refunding"" has been very well reviewed, and demonstrates my depth of knowledge in such fields.

Evolution Forums,phantom4861,38487,2014-12-18T19:00:56,Re: [VOUCHED] TG - Paypal DOUBLEUP Guide - V1.0,Guides Vendors,"VOUCH!: I feel very privileged to a received a copy of thegifter's latest guide, and after reading it, very excited about what it offers. Titled the ""Paypal Doubleup Guide"" (how to double your money with paypal). And it is very thorough - a whole 34 pages of simple step-by-step instructions. It details the whole method, with helpful links to all the resources you need. By the format and language, you know instantly this is a professional, who has had a lot of experience, and knows what he's talking about. I really can't imagine anyone needing extra support after buying the guide, as it is all there, and all you need to do is follow the steps, with planning and patience, and even a total beginner can be successful, with little investment and experience needed. There is a hell of a lot of potential to earn serious money here, and as I said with little investment. You are only limited by how many times you can be bothered to repeat the method, as this guide is fool-proof in telling you how to set up multiple accounts. The added bonus with this method is also that you are not relying on paypal transfers from other people, waiting, trying to avoid chargebacks, etc. This is a completely different sort of method for earning cash from paypal, and one that you are completely in control of by yourself.

In the introduction he makes it crystal clear on what resources you will need and what restrictions apply in order to get started. The method itself is 100% new, as it exploits a new feature which PP has released for accounts based in the United States. I've read a dozen guides on PP, from Moka's Jungle Money, Yasuo's PP guide, Alphawolf's PP guides, most of the guides that are available for free on TCF & clearnet, to the guide packs I bought on the evo marketplace and not a single one mentions the method Stormshadow has written about in his PayPal Ninja guide, you can imagine my surprise. As hugostheman has already mentioned in his review, as of now I would too consider this is to be the best method on clearing hacked accounts, and I also do agree with lowering the price a tiny bit, even though you can potentially make a lot of money with it, the downside is it could get saturated anytime soon, as it is unknown how many people are currently using this method, therefore we don't know how long it'll work, keeping in mind that PP is a bitch to deal with in general because of their strong fraud prevention system.Where I disagree with hugo is the US PP accounts restriction, because in my opinion it is very easy to obtain US PP accounts via various sources on the deep web and even clearnet. I don't know how this could be an issue, unless you want to, but don't know how to transfer these funds into non-US accounts. It's a no brainer to me.So to summarize, the method is new, easy and surprise surprise actually working, therefore I think it's definitely worth your time and money. Additionally, it is newbie friendly, well explained and written in clear English. The downside is, the method will eventually stop working or will be harder to apply, so you need to exploit it right now, as quickly as you can before the PP fraud prevention cunts ruin it for us once again.I'd like to thank Stormshadow for the copy and wish you best of luck with your sales!;nancybotwin wrote:Paypal Ninja by Storm Shadow is six pages of step by step instructions on how to cashout hacked Paypal accounts.

Hacked Paypal account.2. Middleman Paypal account.3. VPN, Socks 5 and/or RDP (Your usual setup for Paypal activities).4. New email account.It's recommended that you hire an email spammer so the owner of the hacked Paypal account won't figure out what's going on.In my opinion, you could likely use a site like http://www.mailbait.info/index.html to take care of that. You're welcome.Normally, I try to write very detailed reviews, however, the method described in Paypal Ninja is very unique and I do notwant to give anything away. I will tell you this - this method will allow you to transfer any amount that's available in the hacked account. The method is taking advantage of what seems to be a new feature Paypal is testing.This is not something that can be done in a day. You'll need to log into the hacked Paypal account from the same IP dailyfor at least a week before doing this method. Having said that, don't let that turn you off because this is pretty much standardwith any method where hacked Paypal accounts are involved. After that, everything goes really quickly.Once the money is in your middleman account, it's up to you to cash it out. Storm Shadow offers a separate guide for thatat a discount for buyers of this guide. I'm sure you could figure out a few ways for yourself. (I haven't seen the cashout guide so I can'tcomment on it).So, have I personally tried the method? Yes. I did a small test run with a hacked account that I already had access to. I was able to cashout just under $500 so far. I consider myself a beginner when it comes to working with hacked accounts (I'm more of a Paypal transfer to my stealthaccounts kinda girl lol). I think this is fine for beginners, especially since the vendor seems readily available to help and answer questions.Recommended!Nancy B."

Before I start, some of you should know what my opinion on most of the guides on evolution is (see: http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=21188), I'd also like to point out that I always try to be unbiased in my reviews and opinions in general when writing on this forum.

I just want him to switch it on one day, and nothing happens. Without evidence.. I thought about short circuiting it, but not sure how this is possible without water, and leaving evidence, or creating a flame lol. This should be simple. So, any serious advice would be appreciated. Because I need revenge. And I would rather take it out on the only thing he has in his life, than him himself, right now anyway.. (If he could get credit, I would have got revenge already). EDIT: I've just realised this is in the wrong section. It was meant for general discussion. Rage has overtaken me lol.

I guarantee you I could recover data from your platters w/ holes in it. Actually, I had a medical facility that was drilling holes into their drives. I found one that would still spin (without physical repairs that I did not feel like doing due to costs/profit margins) and recovered data from one that was drilled through. I've read a few of your posts now about data destruction and your ""ccleaner alternative."" I really hope nobody purchases that from you and gets themselves v& because of it. and recovering after DBAN? Unless the user fucked up, you did not recover data. If you believe that, I will wipe a drive w/ DBAN and bet money that you won't recover shit from it. That being said, I DID write an app that does data destruction (worked at a data destruction company) and have since turned it into a killswitch type of software. If someone comes knocking, run a quick command and it's game over.

Like i already mentioned experienced, ""gateway cashout"" users will have a 99% chance, of already knowing this site, when i say ""experienced"" i do not mean just a Stripe user i am talking about people that have used a handful of payment gateways. The MethodLike i mentioned above the method does WORK but cashout`s can vary, having been experienced with this gateway, i can tell you sometimes you will hit BIG sometimes you will hit small, but all in all the vendor is selling a product that works."

The price of the package is now temporarily reduced to 150$ in order to celebrate the vouches and give back to the community,"nancybotwin wrote:I received a vouch copy several weeks ago, but because of health reasons, I've been off of the forums for some time. On the up side, Ive had a lot of time to test this method. Here is my review as promised.Stratton Oakmont's Cashout 3.0 is ten pages of very detailed instructions on how to turn inexpensive CVVs into Cash/BTC pretty easily. Those of you familiar with Stripe or any of Mokas offerings will already know of the payment processor used. I believe noobs to payment gateways/processors will get the most out of this. In order for this method to work, you will need the following:US Bank Drop. Brick and mortar bank is suggested, however, I used Ally bank just fine.Standard carding setup (VPN/RDP/SOCKS ETC)US CVV and or DUMPS (I did not use dumps)Fullz Android Emulator (free download)Strattons guide is a quick read and you can get started right away. The only thing you will have to wait for is for your bank account to receive test deposit/withdrawal to verify the account (2 days or so) then away you go!There really isnt much to say here without giving away a lot of the info in the guide. Youre basically just charging cards all day long. Its easy and very profitable. No rocket science here And unlike Stripe, this processor doesnt have waiting periods. Charge cards on Monday, money is in your account on Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday. Cashout to Coinbase or like me, cashout to a Paypal account if youve got one attached to your bank drop (because Coinbase can be a bitch sometimes).Start off small and you can work your way up to $500 a day easily. When you burn your account, get another one and keep going. With a little bit of work youll make a very nice income.Pros: Easy method, Fast Cashouts, Excellent list of resources included, Vendor seems nice and helpful.Cons: Price. $200 is a lot for this guide honestly because it only covers one processor. I would rather see a $75-$95 dollar price tag.Definitely recommended with a price adjustment  Nancy B."

With the first update the price will rise by 25$ and with the second update by approx. 50$. All customers that have bought the guide before that point will get the first update for free and the second for half price.  Content  Update 1: *More detailed instructions on how to set up genymotion*   *How to spoof and re-use physical devices*   *FAQ*Update 2: Addition of more payment gateways (2-3) /\ Possibly included: How to create a US bank account \ How to cash out and launder money  Release Date Update 1: 13.02.2015Update 2: Approx. 01.04.2015      The release of the second update depends on the amount of information included but it is possible that I'll split it into 2 updates with different release dates. The price of this business package will rise as well but not as much as the price of the single guide. I'll keep everyone updated about the exact pricing model.,

It all rides on how cash motivated you are, with the starbucks. You can make 1k - 3k a day.  Just depends how motivated you are. As for resources, there are multiple avenues to cashing out. If you can't afford are get resources xx just yet.  You can use method xx, until you can afford the better cash-out option of xx. You'll at the most need a fake ID, gas money, and a burner.",

Evolution Forums,Z0l4f,43320,2015-01-15T22:26:32,Re: The Amazon Mine & The Starbucks Cashouts,Guides Vendors,"I received the guide. This is my honest review.  Idea: Use multiple platforms to build a cashout solution. (Starbucks, Amazon, etc..) What I received is a little hard to follow. But, after it was explained to me I get it. It is possible to make a decent wage off of this, but in my honest opinion it is a bit convoluted. This will require a lot of work at first, but eventually once you get a team in place and get the right resources under your control, you will be able to autopilot this.  What I liked: Crazy and unique, even zany way of making some cash. Doesn't require any advanced knowledge of the field. Doesn't require a massive investment to get started. Once I understood how it all worked together and combining my two favorite things (sbux fraud and amazon ddipping) I truly like the concept.  What I didn't like:The format and explanation of the method. Price (I think it is worth 100$ max, with support from the vendor to the customer). How many steps it takes to complete. There is no way you will make 1-3k a day. Maybe a week. I am not saying this can't increase, but I am saying it is impossible to clear that volume at first.  Conclusion: Tweak the method so that it flows together. Use more concise sentences and graphics to assist the customer. Lower the price, and deflate the expectations.  Please do not take any offense as I have offered a critical review and overall DO like the idea.  SCORE: 6.5/10 Recommended to buy: with a price decrease.  Thank you, iCards.",
Evolution Forums,SuzyGreenberg,43320,2015-01-15T23:36:31,Re: The Amazon Mine & The Starbucks Cashouts,Guides Vendors,A lot of people can't assemble a team to aid in their fraud activities. I'm guessing this isn't the guide for me.,
Evolution Forums,iCards,43320,2015-01-15T23:50:20,Re: The Amazon Mine & The Starbucks Cashouts,Guides Vendors,"Appreciate the feedback bruhs, I think the avenue I'll be taking with this manual and tutoring, is I'll constantly take a approach and update it, revise with each sale after following the feedback I think eventually throughout the course of time. It'll start building up a increased value.  So, I'll turn it down to 100$, I'll be writing based off a few speculations, concerns and the addition of added chapters etc.  Z0l, if you wake up very early in the morning. Say, when shit starts opening? Buy a shit load of dirty transfers, transfer a gross amount spread across a incremented amount of 100,200,300, And you're telling me you cannot cash-out in day? No offense taken, just failing to see your logic with that statement.

Evolution Forums,uut89,32192,2014-11-16T20:08:08,Re: -------------------------,Guides Vendors,"I've had the time to go over everything in it, so i'll drop a review I'll cut it in two parts for two types of people - ""noobs"" & more experienced paypal users. Personally i've got some PP experience, and with good tech knowledge. New people: This guide is awesome. I've read many shitty guides bought from the marketplace, mostly just bits copied and pasted into a .txt file. Pretty shit to read, usually missing parts, and often dont explain what and why you are doing it.Mrbtc's guide takes a step by step approach, starting from the very beginning, with the steps of what you should do, in the exact order you should do them. He tells you the resources he personally uses (which would have saved me money in the beginning if i knew where to spend it), and pretty much guides you through the entire process. so all round its worthwile reallywith a little bit of time and money you'll be able to make a consistent amount of money from it (you wouldnt need much at the start to be fair if you are struck for cash, like he mentioned about a ""quick and dirty"" process, it would possible to use these methods with less than $100, and make quick money from it. however the real gem is how he's explained to consistently do it, while being able to make more each time.) More experienced guys: I dont know how far this would help existing paypal vendors, as im sure they already have their own methods. sections 2 onwards wouldnt help you so much. however its really nicely layed out for anyone wanting to set themselves up as a paypal transfer vendor. It's good to stick with rules, less will go wrong, and you'll make more money, the step-by-step nature of the guide provides this i think! Section one is awesome and existing vendors may not know so much about it (dont hold me to that though!! just speculating, haha) see below: Section 1 is the bit im really impressed with.I haven't seen it in any guides ive purchased (admittedly i haven't bought any of the more expensive guides above 0.1btc, so cant really compare.) however i was not aware of the method in section one at all, and this to me is worth the entire money for the guide haha its such a nice way to do things, and i think im going to try and tailor it based on my own experience (to cash out in the most efficient method for myself.)  the guide itself is in PDF format, nice writing, good spacing: thus easy to read. it does include a few screenshots which is always nice.

Personally i've got some PP experience, and with good tech knowledge.New people:This guide is awesome. I've read many shitty guides bought from the marketplace, mostly just bits copied and pasted into a .txt file. Pretty shit to read, usually missing parts, and often dont explain what and why you are doing it.Mrbtc's guide takes a step by step approach, starting from the very beginning, with the steps of what you should do, in the exact order you should do them. He tells you the resources he personally uses (which would have saved me money in the beginning if i knew where to spend it), and pretty much guides you through the entire process. so all round its worthwile reallywith a little bit of time and money you'll be able to make a consistent amount of money from it (you wouldnt need much at the start to be fair if you are struck for cash, like he mentioned about a ""quick and dirty"" process, it would possible to use these methods with less than $100, and make quick money from it. however the real gem is how he's explained to consistently do it, while being able to make more each time.)More experienced guys:I dont know how far this would help existing paypal vendors, as im sure they already have their own methods. sections 2 onwards wouldnt help you so much. however its really nicely layed out for anyone wanting to set themselves up as a paypal transfer vendor. It's good to stick with rules, less will go wrong, and you'll make more money, the step-by-step nature of the guide provides this i think! Section one is awesome and existing vendors may not know so much about it (dont hold me to that though!! just speculating, haha) see below:Section 1 is the bit im really impressed with.I haven't seen it in any guides ive purchased (admittedly i haven't bought any of the more expensive guides above 0.1btc, so cant really compare.) however i was not aware of the method in section one at all, and this to me is worth the entire money for the guide haha its such a nice way to do things, and i think im going to try and tailor it based on my own experience (to cash out in the most efficient method for myself.)the guide itself is in PDF format, nice writing, good spacing: thus easy to read. it does include a few screenshots which is always nice.

As far as the bins I recommend a bin type to get but as far as exact bins I never followed specific ones myself. I just worked with my vendors for good bases. It would look suspicious on PP;s side if you got 10+ transfers etc from the exact same bin. But I can go and look through my lists and see which bin's I've had the most success with and update it in the guide.

Evolution Forums,jeweethet,32192,2015-01-20T17:01:48,Re: -------------------------,Guides Vendors,"Misterbitcoin, i sended you 3 or 4 PM and the first one is about 2 weeks ago, and still didnt received any reply back.... I must say that your guide is detailed, and the guide itself is way better then most of the guides... But there are 2 small questions that i have, which are for you probbly explained to me in a few sentences...While i try days to get it right or get a solution. Then i see that you are posting on the forum and also replying other people as you said. While there is alot of information in the guide that i didnt know yet (thats a good thing) , still your guide didnt resulted in any more profit or results then the rest of the ""cheap"" guides on evolution.and i spend 1 BTC on your guide, for tht price i expect some results. While i really dont want to give you a bad name, i prefer always to discuss or complain to a seller trough pm instead of on the open forum,i really saw no other possibility to try to reach you... i really beleive you are a great seller, and i expect that you are busy and didnt noticed my messages,but pls understand my situation aswell... On the other side, i think if misterbitcoin gives me the answers on the few small questions that i have, i expect this to be a very valuable guide which could earn alot of money. Aside from the (i think miscommunication) , its not so long ago that i bought this guide, so i dont know misterbitcoin very well,but WARNING --- >>  i really advice to NOT buy the leaking guides that are circulating on the evo market !! <<---- because of the following facts:  1. Yes, they are much cheaper, but know that you wont get any updates, and beleive me, paypal and the other methods in this guide chance alot!! so without updates, your guide will be about useless in a matter of days - weeks... so to get it working again, you need to search and buy a updated guide ... do this a few times, and its not as cheap as you thought it was anymore... 2. i saw a leaked guide, and it was almost the same exept some links and such where changed (i think so the seller of the leaked guide can make profits as it might be links to his own shops / listings) but i expect the products are bad quality... anyway, i hope misterbitcoin will update his guide frequently and watches his pm a bit better, then it is the higher price , more then worth!",

Honestly I've been a bit busy, and haven't had a chance to try this out. I had a few questions, but haven't PM'd because I know you're busy and was hoping for the 2.0 update soon. I'd like to ask some questions, but I think it might be easier for you if you just send us a quick and dirty FAQ while we're waiting on the update. I agree that the guide is well-detailed and a worth the money. Seriously awesome information! I haven't left a review yet because I haven't put it to use. I'm finally ready so I'll be PMing you the questions if there's no update coming soon. To add on to what jeweethat said, buying the guides also supports the writers.. and if people keep leaking and stealing the guides, then we'll stop getting this incredible knowledge that these guys give us. If you make 1 good transaction you'll make your money back plus more.. and have steady support for the entire time!",

Evolution Forums,misterbitcoin,32192,2014-11-13T17:44:10,"MISTERBITCOIN's PAYPAL GUIDE - Transfers, middle mans, cash outs!!",Guides Vendors,"I think this guide will be unique as there's 100's of cashout guides but seems the transfer and proper middle man accounts is missing. The guide will be 6 part: 1) My own formula for my own private transfers -This is what I use for my own cashouts, as far as I know no PP transfer service does this as it takes more time up front but the results are way better.This method allows the funds to stick without chargeback for a LONG time plus there very clean compared to most methods which means less restrictions on the cash out account smile Also the cost is a fraction of the transfers, you get a 10x better ROI on your money. 2) Volume Transfer'sThis will cover a to z how PP transfers are typically made(what you buy from PP transfer service on EVO)(you could start your own transfer service with this information or just use it for your own cashouts) 3) How to make your own super strong middle man accounts;This will cover absolutelly everything you need to make strong middle man accounts, which includes: -how to setup the account(rdp,socks, etc)-how to verify the account with big brand name's-how to age accounts WITH transaction history-Beating paypal errors- SMS verification - How to fix limited accounts- How to send/receive and limations for accounts 4) Paypal Transfer funnel (show payments should be sent) 5) The cash outs I use, 3 different types 6) Resources section  This can be used for quick and dirty or can be aged properly to received massive amount of funds, everything is explained. With this guide you'll never have to rely on a paypal transfer service again, but even better you'll be able to make yourself transfers that stick and not mess with your accounts. You'll also be able to make your own middle man accounts for the fraction of the going rate and these will be able to handle funds ALOT better, you can also use the same methods to build very strong cash out accounts. I will also provide were to find all the resources needed, which are a fraction of the going rate for PP transfers    I will also be providing full support with guide so if you have any questions I'll be here for assistance!  The first 3 copies will be discounted @ $150 and then will go up to $250-$300. I think this is a fair price considering the going rate for PP transfer these days you could make your money back in a transfer or two max. If you buy one of the $150 copies I would also like to come back and leave a review shortly after buying.  Discounted review copy: (SOLD OUT, in under 5 mins 0_0 ) SOLD OUT  Regular copy $250 (price will go up after a few more sold): http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/54557 TY MB

Looking for a couple reputable members to vouch for it. The price of the guide will be $60. Its not anything that is going to totally blow your mind but it is a whole new approach to obtaining drops. It is very safe, you will have 100% control over the drop. No racing to beat someone to a mailbox. No looking for empty houses. You can get an unlimited amount of safe drops with this!   Concept designed for US and Canadian residents but can be used worldwide by applying your own slight modification.  http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/22186

I have nothing against you and you have no reason to be so offensive about. Purse.io is a marketplace where you buy amazon products for customers in exchange for BTC Payment. This is obviously one of your methods. it has been here on Evo for a long time. Your obviously utilizing other guides here on Evo and spinning them. lastly your guide is way to expensive. Id suggest giving Trippy a Vouch. He is a longtime member and may help with sales. Its good that your doing a walkthrough but if you dont understand Amazon's Fingerprinting and detection than you will be completely out of luck, but as I see you are using GHOST accounts. Most likely a spin off of Amazon Ghost. http://www.aspkin.com/forums/ebay-discussion/23657-amazon-suspension-guide-amazon-ghost.html Using amazon as your merchant posting fake products and cashing out before customers know they have been fooled and before they can charge back there credit card. Glad you summed up other good guides and put it into one walk through though. Would hope you made it noob friends because amazon is very good at tracking, very very very good. |Obviously a spin off, but good job. Gotta make some BTC somehow. If you were really killing it like this you would not be selling. This will get saturated and Amazon once again will update there security like they always do. Why sell something you can make a killing off of? Reason is its alot more difficult than it seems and more o a hypothetical guide than a tested one. Id love to see a review that is tested. If your serious ill Vouch it as I know a vast amount about internet security and Amazon flagging system. If not thats fine, but still no reason to sell something so valuable unless you cannot utilize it.SIMPLE MollyCanada",

You are the one coming on another vendors thread claiming he is reselling other people's guides while I have been selling this guide since 4 months. So you might understand why I might be offended. I am also not coming on your thread and claiming all sorts off things about your business without any factual basis. I don't know who's guides you are claiming I am reselling but to my knowledge I am the only vendor selling a guide like this and if there are others my guide was most likely the first one to be published (here on Evo at least). The price of guides is always based on three factors: -How much can it make per day/week-How long to break even-How much investment is required Based on that I would say 100$ is a very fair price. Other people have been buying and using this guide since several months and it is confirmed that is works so I don't really see why you have a problem or think I have to prove myself to you or anyone else. This is simply an update to an existing guide. Lastly as for why I am selling the guide. This doesn't exploit one single small time website and with the methods used here it is highly unlikely that it changes anything at all in Amazon's security. I can sell the guide and still use the method myself so why not sell it and at the same time help other people to make money as well. Anyways good luck in your business ventures. Cheers,

Here's why. The majority of your customers will come from people interested in doing amazon refunds. a 1k refund = $100 if paid to a vendor here and no work is needed on our part. I would buy it at $50, I'll probably buy it at $100, my point is only that you are selling this guide to people breaking the law to make money - that means they probably don't have much to start with. Making it more affordable WILL increase your sales.  cheers  ps: thanks for writing it, just sharing my 2c. I don't aim to offend, if I do, my apologies.",

It also shows you how to do unlimited refunds without using a drop. So basically for the 100$ here you don't only get one refund but actual knowledge to do everything yourself.

If you visit a clearnet site without tor, your ip may be flagged as they may be monitoring the traffic to the url that has been posted on the forums and it's easy to notice when a video/article only gets a few views, then when posted on the forums gets 200 views, they can assume most of those ips are forum users. They would then add you to a list, and let's say you then sign into your facebook with that vpn ip, you may then be added to a watch list.",

SWIM and You should never use the internet at the same time. Does Superman and Clark do same thing at same time?  To op.... Clearnet links are safe to click on when using Tor, just make sure javascript is disabled and noscript is installed / working. You announce clearnet links out of respect for others because it's not as-safe. Anytime you tell someone to lower security, you should warm them about risks. Saying, go look at this, if it's clearnet, should have a warning. Again, just to be nice.  It's up to end user to decide risks.",

Proper opsec begins in the mind, so you really shouldn't be doing both of those things at once. All it takes is one simple mistake, once, and every step you've taken to anonymize yourself is undone.

I do put a simple logger on them though to keep track of changes once I get one as an added feature. A lot of people keep their desktop PCs online 24/7 so it usually isn't too big of a deal and they last a while until they catch you or get a hard knock.","noble wrote:Sadly, the only dependable 24/7 solutions don't come with a residential IP.

The reason I don't want to give this opportunity away is because its actually helping people make money There's no such thing as a get rich quick method - THOSE are the actual scams With my book, I'm pointing you in all the right directions, and giving you STEP by STEP treatment....the methods me and Colleagues have used to make a fortune underground   Tell me, if you had a way to make a ton of money in a short time, you wouldn't be here bashing new guys and other guys You would be out making your salary right now.  I understand there's a 'thing' going on with Scams on Evo, therefore the Guru members of Evo are extremely judgmental of everything and everyone. I did not put 5 months of labor into this book just to ""scam"" someone...that would be shame on me.  Yes I'm a new member on evolution, no I'm not new to the Darkweb. I've been on the Darkweb since 2000, and played a part in Operation ""get rich or die tryin""I've made my money, had my money, now I want to give back.  I only have 1 product, one book has helped me make my monthly salary. I'm thankful and glad I can actually give this to people whom deserve to make money in these times of debt and depression  I'm only afraid of someone leaking this out to others, because in reality....if it gets leaked out other people will try to sell my book (hence why I labeled my name inside the book with personal notes)  Lastly I understand my store only has freshman statues That's ok because this is my one and only product, My prize possession that I've spent years perfecting. The best selling product in 3 communities and best on silk road before they shut it down (not going back because I don't trust 2.0) I don't plan on selling this to everyone. and I don't plan on selling alot either. Just a small circle will share the success with me.  Cheers, comrad

The guide is a simple 5 steps and is extremely easy to follow. With this guide you can get ANYTHING you want from the dominos menu for completely FREE! I personally use this guide and get free dominos about 3 times a week (i could do it as much as i want, but it is quite fattening so i have to keep it at 3 orders a week). The guide will be sent to you via a message in the form of plain text. Please note: I have only tested this method in the UK and it has worked 100% of the time. This method involves using PayPal, so if your local Dominos website does not accept paypal, it most probably wont work for your location.It doesn't involve carding or anything else! I really recommend this method to everyone in the UK! I have easily gotten a few thousand pounds worth of food for absolutely free!

Evolution Forums,fnufnu,9353,2014-05-08T02:48:06,Re: How to secure an iPhone 5S,Security & Anonymity,Basically what I have done so far. I don't think you can really turn an iPhone 5S off. The only way it is really off is out of battery. The thing with iPhone is that you can't take the battery out. You can take the SIM out but the phone can still be tracked by the device itself. I don't see a GPS in the setting of 5S. I disabled location services when I was setting it up for the first time. But you know there is a backdoor to turn it on. fnu,"LudoTilMortem wrote:Buy it with cash or card it, just make sure it's not attached to yourself.

Check this out: http://www.ebay.com/itm/US-Cell-Phone-RF-Signal-Blocker-Jammer-Pouch-Stop-Tracking-Bugging-Case-Cover-/181357061982?pt=US_Cell_Phone_PDA_Cases&hash=item2a39b9275e,

Just try to search the clearnet for certain apps/softwares which disable the default features of an iPhone (a jailbroken one, of course). However, if you want a burner phone, go with a basic phone (such as Nokia's) or use an Android one. They can be configured better for the job.",Scattermind wrote:You should jailbreak/root your phone.

It's never used but I can't sell it for brand new anyways so I thought I might be able to use it at least for a burner between me and my errand boys. Scattermind: I thought about that too. But I was concerned it may break the phone. Or just brick it totally. Only thing I was worried about actually is that he might get stupid and use it for personal stuff and got it traced back to him. benzon: The idea of a signal blocking pouch is nice but thing is, if my boy keep the phone in the pouch all day, how do I contact that phone? The calls would be blocked. fnu",
