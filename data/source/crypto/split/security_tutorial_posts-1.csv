Never, never, think that Tor encrypts your traffic! It does not! The person who runs a Tor exit node can easily sniff all plain-text traffic! Tor only anonymity your traffic, but it can still be sniffed plain-text at the beginning and at the end of the onion route! So don't do any HTTP-auth, or plain-text password sending for e.g. POP3, telnet, and so on. Always use encryption in addition to Tor!Watch your language, especially in public forums or IRC. A linguist can probably easily figure out which country/region you're from if you speak/write broken English or use certain idioms or false friends. This might or might not be a problem for you, but it's something you should bear in mind.If you're extra paranoid, you could set up your firewall to block all outgoing DNS traffic and force all applications to use Tor to resolve names. You could probably also block all outgoing non-Tor traffic...    Forget your love for browser plugins. By default, the Tor browser has the likes of Flash, RealPlayer, and Quicktime blocked since they have been known to reveal your IP address. Having said that, installing additional plugins and add-ons onto the Tor browser is highly discouraged â it may cause Tor to malfunction and may affect your privacy settings. Although YouTube content is generally blocked as well, some videos can work on the Tor browser through an experimental opt-in feature.Always use HTTPS when visiting websites. It shouldnât be a problem if youâre using the Tor browser since it already includes HTTPS Everywhere, but just to be completely sure, keep a keen eye on the URLs you visit.Donât open downloaded materials while on Tor. Documents and PDF files may reveal your non-Tor IP address when you open it through external applications. Wait until you can disconnect from the Internet before opening these files.    Advanced security DNS Protecting against all DNS leaks     DNS leaking default TOR, yes it TOR can leak and here is the fail safe :     Put this in /etc/tor/torrc,  open terminal in linux,  type (  gksudo nautilus  ) and find the file to edit.   ## AutomapHostsOnResolve 1  ## DNSPort 53  Restart TOR  Protecting against all DNS leaks using iptables  Run this command on startup    (on linux  desktop,    I have it in /etc/rc.local):       ##  iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53      Now,  all outgoing DNS requests are dealt with anonymously by Tor.

Abraxas Forums,Docta,29,2015-03-24T12:04:36,Â»Â»Â» EASY 4096 PGP (Step by Step Guide) Â»Â»Â»,General Category/Security," Keep everything in an encrypted format including you copy of pgp4usb and all URLâs and Password backups.  Will there be a PGP identity challenge to logon? The strength of the door is in the complexity of the key not the bolt or lock. I raze this question to help inform people of how math based security works in regard to the excellent most excellent information in this thread.  Following to the letter the information given here in a most detailed opening post in this thread  creates an effect called background anonymity  where the anonymity of a huge majority makes gathering of evidence against a small minority whom have had their identity discovered almost impossible owing the improbability of hitting a commercial  level transaction. It would take an impossibly large amount of recourses identifying who is exactly messaging who and what for.    This brings me back to abstract mathematical problems as a basis for security, the more complex the theoretic problems, the more secure. This type of math based security is called cryptography. Docta was lucky enough to be invited to be a contributing member a worldwide group networked freely by Microsoft. The Cryptography, Security, and Applied Mathematics (CSAM) are a global community of thinkers who you have to thank for all the free papers published with information that protects and the PGP security proofs and applications of signature schemes the you are being introduced to in this thread.  Problem is modern cryptography has advanced but PGP has hardly advanced at all it is twenty years old. We approach a point of computer power capable of implementing brute force algorithms that see symmetric-key cryptography such as PGP as just another set of complex theoretic problems to be solved.   Encryption programs implement current Advances in Cryptography, Security and Applications for Future Computer Science (FCS)  Encrypting a small 1GB container or a flash drive or both give the added safety of FCS as the encryption engines evolve as a result of an algorithm utilizing State-of-the-art technologies. Keeping all of your dark-Web applications and information in a modern encrypted format negates the age of PGP as a P2P communication assets. With the added peace of mind knowing data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication countermeasure will protect your anonymity.  If I had to recommend an Encryption program, First choice would be BitLocker because its under constant FSC bleeding edge asset protection. Second and a good one because itâs portable running well from flash drive is TrueCryt version 7.2  be warned this program finished design of new cryptographic primitives in 2014 and receives no updateâs. TrueCryt may be the best to go for because it has the best step by step features for the first timer.    Now hereâs the catch;  The strength of the encryption algorithm goes hand in glove with the amount of characters used to generate secure multiparty computation. In other words you need to remember a password with more than at the very minimum twenty numbers, symbols, letters, upper and lower case. I know this sounds impossible but it can be broken down into segments to make up a set of zero knowledge proofs. Knowledge only you know put together to make up the master encryption key.  Example: first segment, the night you lost your virginity; (WithJess@the drivein) second segment use a date of significance only to you and you alone. Suddenly you have an encryption key thatâs unbreakable and youâll never forget.   WithJess@thedrivein15May1998  The law may charge you with the crime of not divulging the password or entering rendering encrypted evidence while under investigation. But fuckâm    Best of all Cryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM) DRM is the protection of data so even if means were found to circumvent DRM technological schemes of the encryption program itself inadmissible as evidenced and a crime DMCA a law which criminalized dissemination of data held in copy writes of encryption. This would make all PGP communications found within an encryption container protected.   Sorry for such a longwinded post but PGP is very old, user friendly but old. The DiffieâHellman key exchange was published in 1976.Encryption container, drive whatever you want to call them keep all your Dark-Web stuff in one place and safe.We can do a step by step with TrueCryt if thereâs interest but I donât know if we can have images, I'll look to see if we can do image attachments with IMG code to insert.   ",

It sounds to me like you're using GPA.... I take it you are using it with Windows?  I haven't used Windows in so long, that I had forgotten what a fucking horror-show it actually is/was.  What you need to do is the following:  1) Open up a command prompt -- you can enter command where it says [Search programs and files] you will then see a black icon that says Command Prompt. Click on it to open up the command-prompt.  2) You will then see something like this:  Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601] Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.  C:\Users\user>  user is the name of the user I'm using here. If you werae using the name Joe, it would show as:  C:\Users\Joe>  Next try going to the following folder: AppData/Roaming/gnupg by issuing the following command:  C:\Users\user>cd AppData/Roaming/gnupg  You will then see the prompt change to if the operation is successful:  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\gnupg>  Now issue a ""dir"" command to see the directory, and you should see something like the following:  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\gnupg>dir  Volume in drive C has no label.  Volume Serial Number is 2FAE-DBCF   Directory of C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\gnupg  03/13/2015  02:33 PM    <DIR>          . 03/13/2015  02:33 PM    <DIR>          .. 03/14/2015  08:07 AM               113 gpg.conf 03/14/2015  08:07 AM               113 gpg.conf.bak 03/13/2015  02:31 PM             3,966 pubring.bak 03/13/2015  02:33 PM             6,180 pubring.gpg 03/13/2015  02:36 PM               600 random_seed 03/13/2015  02:31 PM             7,426 secring.gpg 06/29/2014  11:44 PM             1,280 trustdb.gpg               14 File(s)         45,644 bytes                2 Dir(s)   8,696,844,288 bytes free  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\gnupg>  You will note the presence of the gpg.conf file here.

Your PGP key is a way to verify ownership and without it you could be a third party trying to social engineer their way into your account.

Abraxas Forums,coldstorage,954,2015-06-06T11:51:03,Is it Ok to use initial for last name on mailing address?,General Category/Newbie Questions,Are you worried about giving your last name to a potentially rogue vendor or do you think only providing your last initial will shield you from law enforcement? If you are asking if your package will still be deliverable with only an initial then the answer is that it should not be a problem. Personally I address my orders as if I were ordering from Amazon. My purchases arrive with my regular mail and I have not had any issue thus far.,

I belong to an unpopular ethnic group. You'd be surprised how often people will screw up my orders for various things (not at big places like Amazon but small operations like this kind of thing).

Abraxas Forums,Blueberry,813,2015-05-23T07:04:16,PGP for Mac Tutorial :D ,General Category/Security,"Alright, so one of the most difficult things for a DNM user to figure out with a Mac is Encrypting their messages via PGP/GPG. I know for a fact actually, as I was right there with all of you who still struggle at one point. It seemed as though I was doomed to never be able to adequately encrypt using this Candy coated Unix kernel. Well, ladies and gentlemen, today is the day you shall succeed in the war against privacy with your Mac    The first thing to do is navigate to this site  Clearnet Warninghttps://gpgtools.org/ If your mac doesn't already have this stock installed in applications under the name ""GPG Keychain"" then you need to install from the link provided.  Now, how to get started with the program we've just discussed.  In order to access the GPG Keychain, navigate to applications, and open ""GPG Keychain"". Upon opening the program you will notice five selections located at the top left of the program window. These selections will read:  'New', 'Import', 'Export', 'Lookup Key', and 'Delete'.  Select the 'New' button. Upon selecting 'New' you will be prompted with a window dropping down that reads ""Generate new keypair"". You will have a few text-areas to fill in. In regards to OPSEC, make sure nothing you type in traceable to you! Fill everything out, and proceed to select the 'Advanced Options' dropdown. Now, you'll notice that they key default is RSA/RSA, and the 'Expire' check-box is automatically checked. This is up to you as to whether or not you want your key to have an expiration date. The only thing you absolutely need to set from this menu is your key length. If this is not already set, you need to select the max length of 4096, for maximum security. Once you've filled out this form, proceed to generate your key.  NOTE:While your key is generating, it is wise to open a text editor and type random keys, as this improves your key strength.  Select the 'Export' button, and export your public key to a location where you can find it. This files will save automatically as .ASC. In order to view this file in text form, you need to right click, open with, and find TextEdit. This will show your public key.  Okay! You've set up your key   Bet you're feeling pretty good right now, I know I was!    Now what? Well, you probably noticed that there is not an option in the program to encrypt text? I know, this is pretty fucked up   Fear not my comrades, all hope is not lost!  At the very top of your mac you will notice, located in the upper left corner, is your apple sign. To the right of this will be the program name (GPG Keychain).  Click 'GPG Keychain' and you'll be presented with a drop down menu. On this menu you will find a hover over button labeled 'Services'. Once you've hovered over this area, you'll see a selection labeled 'Services Preferences'. Select 'Services Preferences'. Once you've selected the button specified, another window will appear. On this window you will see an area with check-boxes. Scroll down and make sure that everything that reads 'OpenPGP:' is checked. Once you've completed this, close the Services Preferences window.  At this point you are probably wondering how you're supposed to encrypt/decrypt/sign text, right? Right!  Open up the program called 'TextEdit'.  I want you to type anything you wish to type, is doesn't fucking matter! Once you've typed whatever your heart desires, highlight the text. After highlighting the text, right click the selection. Upon right clicking the selected text you will be presented with a drop-down menu. On this menu you will see the hover over button 'Services'. Upon hovering over this you will find several options for your text offered by the GPG Keychain software. These services look like this:  OpenPGP:Verify OpenPGP:Sign OpenPGP:Import Key OpenPGP:Encrypt OpenPGP:Decrypt  Select which ever one you need to use.  If you select 'Encrypt' you will be prompted by a small window to select the key to encrypt the text to. You will need to select the key you wish to encrypt to as well as select the dropdown menu that says 'Your Key' to the left of it. From that dropdown menu, select your key.

You never said from where to were, but we can talk about personal statistics of ours - We say 7 days in within EU and 14 days to USA. Maximum waiting time...  We do get within the EU within 2-3 working days, and to the USA within 8-10. However, there are some times (2% from all orders) that clients do wait the full waiting time. It's not unlikely to the PO to be delaying and them having the parcel and taking their time, so to speak...  BUT - on the same breath we can also say we did get some packages delivered within EU the next day, And... and this one might surprise you - we did got some delivered in the USA within 2 days. Yes, delivered.  So, as you can understand, it's not science and not always the same time. 14 days a package would arrive from point A to point B anywhere in the world. That's a fact.  All in all, once again, you never said from where to where. EU-EU? 7 might cut it, stay calm. Domestic? (US-US) same story. 7 will do it. Other than that - and we're looking at 14 to be maxed out.  Don't worry. If it's on the way it's on the way. Always leave your coins in escrow and only release/finalize upon receiving the goods.",

I can help you out! The procedure is very simple:  1) I will provide DNM Bitcoin address under my profile. You proceed to send the Bitcoins to that address. It will take around 15-30 minutes depending on DNM's confirmation policy.  2) You will need to provide your home address via PGP encryption. You can obtain my public PGP via profile right here in this forum.  3) When the order is marked as shipped, I will take a screenshot and email it to you. Or I can upload the image via shadowchat via ShadowCoin client - more secure that way.  4) I am not here to scam, but have the desire to build my reputation as an intermiedary.  Method of contacting me:   - I would prefer shadowchat via ShadowCoin client. You can download it via www.aboutshadow.com; if you want to download the blockchain, PM me for link. Then I will send you my SDC address and public key to initiate the chat. This will allow me to upload pictures (don't worry, the picture will be scrubbed off for any EXIF and/or metadata info).  - You can email me via TOR: blacklist@sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion  EDIT, actually, here's the link to download the blockchain w/ instructions: http://shadowtalk.org/topic/308/bootstrap-instructions  - It will cost you $10.00 per transaction; I only accept ShadowCoin (SDC) for the transaction fee. You can use shapeshift.io to instantly convert Bitcoin into ShadowCoin - no registration or ID required. AWESOME! RIGHT?!  Interested? PM ME! Don't reply. When our service is concluded, please leave a feedback.  More info:  www.aboutshadow.com https://shapeshift.io/  Thanks, Blacklist ",

Abraxas Forums,Lazarus,763,2015-05-24T03:45:18,New User Questions,General Category/Newbie Questions," The allegations surrounding the IP leak were never provided any shed of proof.  My theory is that during an early DoS, Abraxas chose to load static web resources(css) by using the private locally mapped ipv4 address of the onion url. When Tor looks up the .onion url and has completed the circuit, your local machine then assigns that circuit to a virtual range of network addresses. By default, Tor assigns from this given range of addresses: ""127.192.0.0/10"". Dependent on the Tor setup, it could also be within these ranges ""10.192.0.0/10"" or ""172.16.0.0/12"" or whatever range of reserved addresses are configured.  Chances are, when the user visited the site, they would have seen these addresses in the browser status bar and assumed they were of the web server itself.

Escrow â the use of a neutral third party to ensure that a transaction payment will be made to a seller on completion of items sent to a buyer. Generally after a purchase is made, the funds are held âin escrowâ to be released when the buyer states the seller has met the terms of the purchase. Generally the third party will also offer arbitration in case of a dispute between the two parties.  FE  -Finalize early. This is the release of escrow funds before the seller knows that the conditions of the contract have been met. This is used to reduce seller risk from BTC price fluxuation, and against market shutdown. This is also used to scam buyers as after the escrow has been released there is no recourse for the buyer if the seller does not deliver on their promises.",

The envelope was mailed from Amsterdam and addressed to a T. Holman at a business in Lindon. A U.S. Customs K9 was reportedly used to sniff the package and the dog alerted on the envelope for illegal drugs. Officers then opened the envelope and found heroin inside.    Homeland Security forwarded the envelope to the Lindon Police Department, and Lindon police tested the substance and found it was heroin and cocaine, according to police. Security was contacted at the business the envelope was addressed to, and officers were told that Travis Holman worked at the business.    According to the police report, the U.S. postal inspector delivered the envelope to the Lindon business Tuesday and contacted Holman, who received the envelope and signed for it.    Holman was taken into custody and booked into the Utah County Jail on suspicion of possession of heroin in a drug free zone and possession of cocaine in a drug free zone."

Andromeda Forums,sydneyjames,283,2014-08-30T00:25:43,*Important* security tip for people looking to become vendors/sellers,Off Topic/Security," It is fairly simple proces to become a vendor on most markets but Anyone looking to do so should just take a few simple precautions before doing so.  First, if you already have an account that you've bought stuff with you should SERIOUSLY consider making a new account for selling stuff. The main reasons for this is, any orders you've made from your account in the past means that vendor may (or may not) still have your name and address from that sale.  This means if you start selling a lot of stuff on here and that other vendor who has your address gets in trouble, they may pass your info along to LE for a reduced sentence or, the original seller could already be associate with LE i  the first place.  Either way its not very safe on your part to use a existing buying account for selling.  Your best bet is to register a new account with a username and password you've never used anywhere else!

The only thing that truly protects your sensitive information is encryption. On any market there can be no way of being safe without ensuring you are fully protected and PGP is your best way to do that.  Using PGP is easy and it is multi-platform. anyone capable of using bitcoin is capable of using PGP.   PLEASE LOOK IT UP AND LEARN IT. we cant stress this enough.   Andromeda is working hard to make this the most secure market possible and has recently added PGP-2FA (2 factor authorization). with a secure market and secure users andromeda can continue to grow into a great market.

Andromeda Forums,hopenchange,23,2014-02-08T20:04:10,P.G.P ugh,Off Topic/Security,hey  PGP/GPG isn't too difficult once you get your head around what is happening.  Basically you have to generate a private/public key pair.  When you do use at the very minimum 2048 bit key but you really should use larger keys.  4096 would be good.  The idea is that you give other people your public key so that they can encrypt a message.  Once they encrypt the message with your public key they send the encrypted message to you.  You hold the private key to the pair and with that you can decrypt the message.  Always keep the private key safe and NEVER give to anyone.  Some links to help you get the idea are below.  I have used tails before but I don't remember if GPG is built in.  It should be if it isn't.  If you do use windows you will want to go here   http://www.gpg4win.org/  Some sites for referencing commands and such.  If I have time I will try to do a proper write up with command examples and such and will sticky it.  There are many other forums on the darknet with the same info as well.     http://www.queen.clara.net/pgp/art3.html   http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/id/gpg-howto.shtml   http://zacharyvoase.com/2009/08/20/openpgp/   http://code.seanodonnell.com/?id=8  ,

Andromeda Forums,LostTemple,42,2014-02-17T04:50:20,General Safety Advice,Off Topic/Security,"There are some general rules for staying safe. They are not covered in detail and I encourage you read more about security and safety.   Disable JavaScript   YOU MUST DISABLE JAVASCRIPT! We are not exaggerating when we ask that you disable JavaScript. There are currently no known exploits, but there have previously been exploits which have revealed the identity of users who had JavaScript enabled. If you are using our site you must disable JavaScript otherwise you are exposing yourself to an incredible risk. Never trust any dark net site that forces you to enable JavaScript. We don't recommend using any clearnet sites through the Tor Browser with JavaScript enabled. Stay safe, disable JavaScript.   Disable iFrames  iFrames can be dangerous for many reasons. This is not desperately important but it is good practice to disables iFrames where possible. They are not needed and pose security concerns.   Passwords  Unfortunately there are some people who use very weak passwords. It is extremely bad practice to use a password as common as this. Even though there is a Captcha robot check on DarkBay there may be some bruteforcers that can bypass the Captcha. If you are going to buy or sell using our service please choose a complicated password. We recommend storing your passwords inside a text document and encrypted with your own PGP key.   Posting Times  Be careful when you make posts on the forums or perform actions on the site. If there is a trend, and people can observe that, you may find your identity dangerously close to being exposed. If you post on the forums concurrently from the hours of 4pm - 10pm EST then anyone who watches and correlates your posts can determine your timezone and possible location. If you are not using a VPN this is extremely dangerous. From this they can observe any Tor traffic in that region and then, with enough posts, correlate your exact location. If you are posting between 4pm - 10pm EST then that also indicates you are a student. Students generally finish school at 4pm and sleep around 10pm. If you are not posting around 6pm, they can assume you are having food and this gives them even more evidence about your timezone. To prevent this from happening we recommend using a VPN to reduce the risks.   Your writing style  Do you ever post on the clearnet? Maybe on Facebook or Twitter? Do you use forums on the clearnet? Make sure that every post you make is very different to the posts that you make on the clearnet websites. I would recommend not making posts on the clearnet at all or sparingly. You should expect that any observing persons have very complicated algorithms for searching the clearnet and correlating posts made there with posts you made here. They have access to Google and all the other search engines, so additionally do not search for anything incriminating. If you post on these forums about searching for DMT, do not then search on Google for DMT. If you need to use a search engine then you StartPage or DuckDuckGo. I strongly recommend going back to any clearnet posts you made and deleting or removing that information where possible. If you are intending to use the dark net regularly, delete your social network profiles, delete your Twitter posts and destroy anything about your life that exists on the clearnet.",

im not sure if this would be a good idea or have the reverse of what im thinking, so i'm just throwing it out there, but perhaps it'd be good for all fees (that is, both IN (marketplace) and OUT (sellers)) to be randomized rather than fixed?For example, instead of Alice buys Bob's $100 item, so Alice $100 -> Market (just using 1.5% for example = $1.50) -> Bob $98.50With every purchase the amounts are all the same, and the differences are associated.I was just thinking along the lines of this...Alice $100 -> MarketsRndValue=(Rnd(1.4-1.6)%) -> Bob ($100 - {MarketsRndValue} Rnd(+/-) Rnd(0.0001-0.002 - ""Weighting"")) (clearly i havent put much thought into the exact figures, but you get the idea). ""Weighting"" would be for example where the more expensive an item is the slightly greater weighting (more possible random values).But the differences are not associated. (Sometimes Bob will make a bit more than usual - sometimes a bit less. Likewise, the market will sometimes take in a bit more than usual - sometimes a bit less)And for example even if the Market randomly settled on 1.483% for 2 different transactions, the % output to Bob would still be different on both occasions as that's randomized too.Also perhaps excess (eg. 1.5-1.6%) can go into a 'pool', where the 1.4-1.5%'ers can take from.  And there are of course algorithms (debiasing?) to ensure people don't get unlucky (or lucky) runs, so the 1.5% (or whatever) target is still hit very concisely overall, but getting there with randomizationAnyway just throwing that out there!ps. dont forget to use CPRNG or true random, not PRNG

SOCKS-change your IP to help you cash out cvv from any country When cashing out cvv's and cc's for do this job safe and successful you still need to know some small but important details.Maybe some of you already try to cash out cvv but the transaction was canceled.This could happen because your IP appear to be in some other country or city that the cvv real holder address.This is very easy to solve,all you have to do is to learn and use SOCKS.Some of you probably think that the VPN is enough but it is not !VPN will hide your IP and without the help of VPN provider you are not trackable.SOCKS is trackable and not secure and all it does is to does is to make your internet browser to appear in the area you chose.So for cash out cvv's you will need you IP to appear in the area that the cvv's real holder lives and for make this possible you have to use SOCKS.But remember that SOCKS are not enough to hide your IP and are used just for ""cheat"" the security system and make them believe that you are living in the cvv real holder area. SOCKS can be trackable ! So even if you will use SOCKS the VPN must still be used!Always activate your VPN before start carding.Clean the browser history and then you are ready to go.We apply SOCKS on the Mozilla Firefox browser.SOCKS5 came in format IP:PORT or for example 23.498.33.910 :9500.In this example 23.498.33.910 is the IP and 9500 is the port. So next time,before you try to cash out cvv using online shopping you must remember to use SOCKS to make your IP appear in the same area as the address of the cvv holder. To download Mozilla Firefox  go to this link http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ .Remember to download all stuff used for carding in English.I know that seems more easy to have your computer set into your own language but is not recommended as cookies saved into your pc will allow the site you visited to have a look to your computer.Lets say that you are a Romanian and your browsers and computer stuff is all in Romanian language.As this language is used only in Romania,who ever can look into your computer may know you are a Romanian citizen.Also make sure that the date and time of your computer is set on format GMT+ or GMT- as the cvv real holder living area.This are small but important details to protect your self and to have success when you try to carding. To change your IP using SOCKS all you have to do is to get a SOCKS provider.There are plenty of Auto-shops which sell SOCKS. I personal use http://vip72.org but there are many other sites from where you can chose.Once you have your cvv and the SOCKS located in same city or area with the cvv address you can start carding.At this moment you already must know what site you want to hit and have everything read to do this work. Open now Mozilla Firefox browser and click ""Tools"", a small pop-up window will be open on your desktop.In this window ,click ""Options"". You will be taken to other window,here click ""Advanced"" and select ""Network"".Click on ""Settings"". An other small pop-up window will open on your screen.Chose ""Manual proxy configuration"" and fill up the Socks Host with the IP you got from your SOCKS provider and then fill up the Port also got from the provider.Click ""OK"" and the both pop-up windows.Now allow few seconds to activate the SOCKS then go to any IP check site and make sure your IP was changed.I use www.hide-my-ip.com ,but you can use any site you trust.Once you have your real IP hidden with the VPN and your computer seems to be located in the cvv real holder area,with SOCKS you can try your best and make some money!Good luck and be safe!

Chaining a Socks5 With TorThere are many reasons why you would need to add an extra hop after the exit node. If you're tryingto card some items on any site with fraud filters you're obviously going to raise some flags if thecardholder lives in New York and you're connecting from a German exit node. Same goes forPaypal logins. Keep in mind you will need to use a clean socks5 within the same region as thecardholder/account. If US within the same state, or otherwise within the same area. A link to sitesproviding private socks services is provided at the end of this article.Even if carding isn't your thing many sites filter out exit nodes, or in the case of 4chan have all beenpermabanned for CP. So it's a necessity to have some control over where you appear to beconnecting from.ProxychainsFirst download & install proxychains:sudo apt-get install proxychainsThen configure proxychains to setup your chain:nano /etc/proxychains.confDown towards the bottom you should see:[ProxyList]# add proxy here ...# meanwile# defaults set to ""tor""Just write your list in using Tor as the first listed:socks4 127.0.0.1 9050socks5 ip.address.here portAfter that you should be done. Just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains:proxychains firefoxProxifierIf you are on Windows you will want to setup your chain using Proxifier. First download and installa cracked copy of proxifier. Once you have it installed and run go to Options -> Proxy Settings andconfigure your chain:+-----------------------------++ 127.0.0.1 | 9050 | SOCKS 5 ++-----------------------------++ IP.ADDRESS | PORT | SOCKS 5 ++-----------------------------+Once you have set your proxy settings go to Options -> Proxification Rules and set the followingrules:+--------------------------------------++ Loopback | ALL | 127.0.0.1 | ALL ++--------------------------------------++ Tor | tor.exe | ALL | ALL ++--------------------------------------+Once you are finished go to Name Resolution, choose Remote, click OK, and you're set. Keep inmind that if you use Proxifier you need to use a browser that isn't already configured to connectthrough Tor or it will ignore the Proxifier settings and just route strictly through Tor. For this guidemy recommendation is a copy of Firefox Portable [1] that has been secured [2].Instructions for Proxifier 3.0Profile -> Proxy Servers -> Add.Address 127.0.0.1, Port 9050, Socks v5 -> Ok. Popup box will ask whether to set as default. SelectYes.Now add your proxy you want to use in the same way. Click 'Proxychains' button then 'Create', anddrag & drop to the new rule. You should have something that looks like this.New127.0.0.1:9050IP address:port (the details you entered earlier)Now go to Profile -> Proxification Rules.In the drop down menu for 'Default' select 'Proxy socks5 127.0.0.1' & uncheck the localhost rule.Then Add -> change action to 'Chain new'. ->Ok.Next, Profile -> Name Resolution. Select Resolve hostname through Proxy.Thats it....you're good to go.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________You can check socks for status, location and against blacklists at http://kingsocks.org &http://www.ip-score.comYou can run a simple DNS test at https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/services/dnsentropy &https://www.grc.com/dns/dns.htmAlways check IP before using at eg http://www.ip-address.org

Not a stupid question. No question is stupid when you want to protect yourself.I totally disagree with Relch, no offense Relch. Saying ""nothing can happen"" is misinformation. You don't even know the OP's intent when it comes to what they want to do on clear/dark net. To answer your question:It really depends on what your intent is. If you're just browing around, and not doing anything you shouldn't, then what you're doing isn't illegal at all. Researching the DN out of curiousity is actually fun. It's a totally different world that a lot of people know about, but don't actually check out. So in this case, if you're not doing -anything- you shouldn't be, or ever will be in the future, it is ok to run both at the same time. Just don't ever do anything illegal, ever, if you do this.You should either be using the DN, or you should be using cleanet. You should not be using both of them at the same time. If anyone disagrees I would like to be educated as to why this isn't compromising. I'm not trying to sound like an ass, I genuinely am interested to know this information, and why connecting to both at the same time from one central point isn't a risky move. Especially since your real IP is connected to clearnet, and the point of a TOR connection is to help hide that IP. If you're looking at FB or a bank account on cleanet, and buying drugs online while connected to both networks at once (even if the IP isn't the same), you're making it easy to ID yourself. The original connection to the TOR network and the clearnet connection come from the same IP when you do this (assuming you're using a standard house connection). If I'm wrong, please feel free to correct, as I do not like to misinform, and it's been a while since I did research on TOR's security. Every time I look though, it's less secure than people assume it is. The NSA likes to take information they have and forward it to local LE. It isn't technically legal I THINK,(although, it might be these days...), but when TOR is invoved, the rules change. Since you're connecting to servers all over the world, it becomes an international thing. Basically, since the NSA monitors all info that is encrypted (TOR AND Clearnet), and non-tor communications to people outside of the US, it can be used to illegally tip off local LE, since spying on your own citizens without a reason is illegal. However, when you're using TOR, they can't determine 100% that you're a US citizen, even if it's pretty obvious to them. They're using a loophole. LE only has to say they received an anonymous tip. You should also not be using TOR to access ANYTHING that is personally related to you, like email, facebook, bank accounts, etc. This just shows that ""The person using this TOR IP is XXXXXX person."", and then it's easy to get your IP once they have your personal info. Some ISPs even flag you for using TOR. Verizon I know keeps tabs on their user traffic, where other providers do not. I've had C&D letters sent to someone I know simply for download torrents. It's a matter of their policies, and if they care about what you do in the privacy of your bandwidth. Comcast made a public statement saying they have no problem with TOR usage, but I don't believe that. In fact, most ISPs probably do TOR tor usage and mac spoofing as red flags, regardless of what their PR campaigns say. This directly connects you to some sort of tor usage, if your ISP is a snitching.People talk about VPNs and such, but really, you can't trust those either 100%. There is always a trail to follow, and VPNs will give up client info if there's enough pressure to do so (even if they say they don't keep logs, I call bullshit on that.)There are better ways to go about protecting yourself without the usage of VPNs and remote access and stuff (all of it leads a trail), but if you're just a smalltime buyer or something, this would be extreme overkill. Do as much clearnet stuff as you want, amazon orders, email, shopping, whatever. I would just advise you not to do it when connected to DN sites. Keep em seperate.If I'm misinforming anyone, please correct. Everyone should know the real facts, in case I have missed any, or was simply incorrect in my statements. Infinite

Everything the (your)ISP (Internet service provider), NSA and every other agency are going to see, is that you are using TOR and at the same time doing online banking.  They can't see if you are browsing something illegal on the DN, they only see that you have been on TOR, which isn't illegal. Simply put, LE won't visit you because you are using TOR. More than 300,000 people only from the US are using TOR on a daily basis.

This is how I saw it in my head, being something of a darknet noob.When I used the darkside I saw myself as being in a ball of black rubber, with no-one being able to see what I was doing, & with me not being able to see out. Then, let's say I got a privnote or some link that I follow out into the clearnet. I thought of myself electronically reaching out through the rubber, making a hole to send data through, & receive it back. I also imagined that having opened that ""hole"" in my black rubber I now permitted anyone who might be watching me to follow me into my black rubber ball & watch me. Of course, I'm a nobody, I'm nothing, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for me to imagine that someone out here might actually be watching me because I'm some sort of threat to society or whatever but again, better to be paranoid that banged up! If for whatever reason someone was watching me, I'd like to think I'd made at least some effort to stop them.Anyway, that's the sort of paranoid imaginings I had going when someone told me that I should not surf the darknet & the clearnet at the same time & I just wondered how true that might be... So thanks for comments! Interesting discussion.

BTC is psedo-anonymous if you will. Total anonymity is rather hard to impossible to achieve against a determined and well-funded adversary [Read the transcripts from the DPR trial about BTC forensics]. If ""they"" want to trace transactions on the public ledger that is the blockchain, they can and will. Plausible deniablity is what imo the average DNM user should be practicing in their DNM funding. Cashouts obv require much more diligence.  But overall imo obfuscation to a degree in which attribution is very tough technically, but more saliently in the eyes of the ""law"" or in the other words, what can be proven in court and admissible for ones' successful prosecution may be the most prudent way to approach ""washing"" the coinz.

Good to know there's an on-site tumbler. I used to go to extreme methods of cleaning my BTC, but since I no longer deal with a lot of them I'm less paranoid. I simply purchase, transfer the coins to an isolated wallet that is not related to me in any way, then transfer to BBM. As a mere purchaser of personal amounts I find that method to be good enough.

Call me paranoid but I don't think you can err on the side of caution, regardless of the market having a tumbler. What if the blockchain shows you sent coin to a dark market tumbler - wouldn't look good in court. I think good practice is: purchased coins --> online wallet --> personal wallet   --> tumbler ---> sit in tumbler, the longer the better ---> market. Of course there are several other details to further obfuscate the ledger trail.Withdrawing from a market I would consider washing twice & possibly exchanging btc --> alt coin --> btc on the exchange that doesn't require any credentials.Jolly Roger's security threads spells it all out and then some.What I wonder is how the Evo shysters intend to wash and cash out 8 figures worth of btc. Apparently, sending pm offers to random members of BTC-E didn't work out so well.Good luck douchebags.

Hi there,as my request is being ignored for many days now i ask in the forum too what someone has to do to delete his own account??? The admins here should take care to the users security needs. I don't understand that in fact nobody does... ??? It will take about 1 minute or sth. like that to do so but nothing happens inspite of many requests... This is kind of crap mates. You should take your users needs serious, especially regarding security matters. Hopefully you will rush now and help in this case. Tks in advance!

Going to start off by saying, mdparity is a one great admin and mrdoe is one great moderator.  However, everyone should ALWAYS be on alert.  This site is realtively new and fast growing so it may have a few bugs in it still.  Let me get on to the topic.If you don't already know, BlackBank Bitcoin Market has it's own system in which it uses AutoPGP.  However this DOES NOT MEAN THEY STORE YOUR PRIVATE KEY.  They have no access to your private key because PGP doesn't need your private key to encrypt data.If you don't already know what PGP is, I recommend you look it up.  However I will give you a quick summary of what it is.PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP is a data encrypter which uses an algorithm to encrypt it messages.  It basically works by giving each user a different PGP Public Key (to share with people so other people can wrtie them) and a PGP Private Key (To decrypt messages.  NEVER SHARE THIS).  You will only the need the other person's public key to encrypt their data however they will need their private key to view the data.Here is an examplePerson A = Public Key : pbkey (not what public keys actually look like)Person B = Public Key : pbkey2Person A will type a messagePerson A's message : send to this address 93 Mp RoadPerson A will then encrypt the data with Person B's Public Key Will look something like this but as a message-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: BCPG C# v1.6.1.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uFXs-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Then only Person B can decode the message with their PGP Private Key.  Not even Person A can decode the message.So that is how PGP works.Now, AccountVendor, why is using AutoPGP a bad idea?Well, BBBM encrypts this data for you meaning you can't see if it actually worked and also the data you enter in is in plain text meaning that it will go out to the system.Think about this.  Although this website is extremely secure things can always happen.- Someone could get into the system and collect all the entries that people enter in with AutoPGPAlthough this feature is a smart and efficient way of Communicating, I think every vendor should not use AutoPGP.  Buyers can get into trouble too with this but as the community grows on there will be a less chance it would be you.But never loose your sense of security.Thank you

Howdy,There is only one copy of the messages kept and they are the same ones you see saved in the messaging system.However, your concerns are all very valid.  If the system was compromised and had privileged access to rewrite the code, they could potentially find a way to collect the data.It's a compromise between security and ease of use.  For those who are very careful, using PGP to encrypt prior to sending the messages is absolutely a great idea.  However, if vendors enable AutoPGP, you can think of it as a preventative measure for buyers who could care less - think of it as a layer of security to protect those who are too lazy.Just to note, there are a lot of people who really could care less about using PGP, and I personally frown upon that.  There is consideration on forced PGP at the moment as well.Cheers,MDParity

Honestly, I didn't care about PGP until this asshole mdparity over here required it for vendor accounts. I think I was just intimidated by it. Perhaps instead of using autopgp, we can quiz new users on PGP after teaching them about it. Nothing too difficult or annoying, but a simple 3 or 5 question quiz over a page of reading.

My experience across many of the newer sites is that hardly anyone i have dealt with is using PGP. Most queries i get are from people who dont have a key.I suspect the average buyer just wants to buy a few drugs without all this work.Many new to the DNM dont know how to PGP.This, combined with the requirement of a bitcoin public key for multi sig escrow is bound to limit sales.I am not sure what the answer is!

It should be very clearly explained in the docs and instructions. And on that note, users should be encouraged to download the brainwallet script to run locally in case that site should be unavailable perhaps....kP

Needless to say, it didn't go anywhere, as Ross wasn't too competent with PGP himself. The reason that people recommended using PGP was as insurance, should the authorities ever get their hands on the Silk Road server. Most people felt this was a remote possibility, but as we all now know, our very worst fears have become reality. The Feds imaged the SR server in June 2013, and they located and imaged the backup server about 3 weeks before Ross was arrested. According to media reports, the backup server was not regularly purged of old data. I think we have to assume, quite literally, that the details of every transaction ever made on Silk Road are to be found on that backup server. When the Feds imaged the main Silk Road server, they were said to have discovered some 1.2 million messages (presumably PMs) on the server. If vendor reports are to be believed somewhere between 80 and 90% of those PMs were not encrypted with PGP. I think it safe to assume that much the same is true of the backup server -- there could be as many as 10-12 million PMs on the servers, the majority unencrypted. The people whose data is encrypted have little to fear. Those who didn't encrypt, on the other hand, are going to be looking over their shoulders for years to come. Axolotl

Almost no one is serious about PGP out there on the DNM's. On the small (but real) chance that someone gains control and collects copies of the cleartext during the moment that the system encrypts it versus PGP becoming standard I think it's a no-brainer. Great little option that AutoPGP, kudos to whoever thought of it.

Wow, so is there still that many people who do not use PGP after what happened at SilkRoad? I am surprised, I figured everybody was using it now. I even got off my lazy ass and learned it after that happened!!So let me ask, even though the autoPGP was enable on the order I made recently, I still used my own PGP in addition to that when I put my mailing information in..that doesnt cause any difficulties for the vendor when trying to read my information does it?

I strongly recommend everyone encrypt their own data and do not rely on any DNM to encrypt their data.If the site and servers ever get taken over by LE they will have a chance to see your pre-encrypted info,if they do seize it they may not tell the public and spend a few weeks collecting addresses...............................................................................If you for some reason cannot figure out PGP with the many tutorials out there I recommend watching a youtube video about it.I know there is a 10-13 minute video that makes it as easy as it really is,that's how I learned and I could not believe how complicated some of the tutorials make it seem,it really isn't...........................................................................................Also,if you only use a few vendors all the time you can make a desktop txt document with your encrypted address so you don't always have to encrypt your address over and over,just make sure to name the txt document the name of your vendor.Good luck everyone.

I'd think ,""will they be able to read it if I encrypted it using my own PGP?"" That's just it. When encrypting a message for someone, we use their PGP. And really we should use the term Public Key. PGP is the concept. Separating those two ideas helps uncouple the confusion for people. (like me at least)I was either learning disabled or ADD or both but for my gen. (born in the 1960's), nobody paid attention , except to punish you for being ""lazy"" or ""shirking your studies"". Add to that, the fact that there was no 'computer class' except for a few brainiacs, probably on the 'mathletes'* team. I've had to relearn how to learn. Thanks to a few patient souls found on forums like these, I've acquired a lot more knowledge, and continue to push that ""lazy"" brain of mine.  (with a little help from modern chemistry)  Thanks to all of those who have been patient with me and others like me.

Considering the evo DB was leaked, and all cleartext, usernames, passwords were stolen and distributed... You really REALLY should learn how to use PGP...The person who leaked it is also one of the 5 people from reddit who the government is after. I'm tellin ya, reddit is no-fucking-good and people need to stop discussing DN related stuff on it. Seriously, you're totally missing the point of DNMs if you're posting about them on reddit... Please stop drawing unwanted attention.On that point, if you are from evo and are using the same password on any market, stop reading this and GO CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY. People on Agora who did this are having their accounts wiped clean.Infinite

FFS You can't even use PGP, if I was a buyer I'd think you're a fucking joke. There's waaay too many idiots on dnm's. And I think forced DOUBLE encryption should be enforced. Vendor has a 4096bit key, buyer too, both use loooong passphrases and both are used for exchanging sensitive information. I'm not going to bother with people who send their address in cleartext - if you're too retarded to use pgp, you shouldnt be on any dnm;s. Go see your local dealer who'll fuck you over and laugh in your face. In my eyes, you're the fucktard here, especially with comments like that. Think about it! MDParity CREATED/ADMINISTERS/HIDES/list goes on a hidden market that's been successful for a long time. You can't even set up your own PGP key. What are you doing even vending? And anyone who buys from you are even bigger fucktards.  I'm starting to think that these cleartext addresses are a) sent by fucktards b) sent by LEO who want to track the source asap. MD - force users and NEVER ACCEPT A VENDOR WITHOUT A PROPER KEY it should be a rule - we'll all suffer, all your hard work is at risk and for what? a 20usd order?  because some asshole HAD to have it by next day or the world will end? FUCK THEM I say. Go see your local idiot dealers instead.I decline orders with cleartext addresses, if you can't follow a simple tutorial then what the fuck are you doing on dnm's anyway? Unless you're LEO, then it makes perfect sense. They don't care about their addresses being seen. Obvious as shit to me.Let's force people to use PGP properly, two keys, not one. I realise that will lower the turnover in the short term but it might motivate them to do some reading and learning and in the long term we can have safer markets that are not compromised. Just my thoughts, MD, I'd appreciate your thoughts on this. Evo didn't give a fuck but they were after your money anyway, they didn't care, I asked them about this and didn't even get a reply.If you're an idiot who can't follow a simple tutorial then stay away, get your fix in other ways. The only way is to force people. Otherwise they revert to their lazy mode, and hearing about a vendor who has a problem with setting up a key? That was the last straw. No more idiots should be allowed. Take their money for bond, but don't activate until they can prove that they know how to securely handle sensitive information. Make them double encrypt something as a test. Fuck me, I thought I heard it all, but that post rattled my cage.Go on Abraxas mate, they'd love you there :)M

Even on evo I didn't accept clear text addresses, It was manditory, and clearly stated in terms of sale.If you are bitching about having to use PGP, you shouldn't be buying shit from places like this. You're bitching about someone looking out for you, which is one of the stupidest thing I have ever heard.A VENDOR who can't use PGP? Gawd, I would never ever trust that person to be able to ANYTHING right at that point. That shit is DNM101. You need to educate yourself. Seriously. No one is ever going to do business with a vendor who doesn't understand PGP, that's just ridiculous..

Problem solved. They could use existing code that they have for the 2FA already just alter it for a one off use and presto.

This is not my story but I figured a very good thing to read and hear. I will provide link to OP at bottom...Yes it finally happened to me, its true it can and does happen and went down as everyone said it would. undercover delivery by postal inspector and swat team style raid. I'm going to explain how it all went down, and how I believe you can protect yourself if it ever happens to youfor my safety i do not mention my country and in fact this did happen months ago ago, i wrote this back then but decided not to publish it here until no one could connect the dates - country unknown and estimated date uknownAfter placing an order with a china RC vendor, while watching tracking, i saw a hiccup in the delivery  - it said ""out for delivery"" but i wasn't home that day so expected to see the ""sorry we missed you"" pink slip in the mail box, well that day they did not leave one, why? same thing the next day, then the third day I'm home not expecting it, and door rings, mail man ""not my usual guy"" with the package. i figured if he was a cop he would have got me the first time.. nope.. as soon as i signed, delivery van opens up and the cops all geared up run out at me - imagine the feeling of my heart sinking in when i see this... at least 15-20 cops state and federal in my house, handcuff me and say we know when you have and been watching you. they claimed then and in court that the ""suspicion"" they had was because the return address from china matched other drug busts they made in the country. it was reasonable suspicion at best I think. they literally did not know what was in the package at that point, they just had an ""idea that it was probably drugs based on the return address"" Im sitting there in cuffs and they're talking shit trying to scare me into giving them consent to open it, now i've been in trouble with the law and i now what to do and said hell no, i shut right up and didnt say a word. they got tough and were like ""oh your gonna be a punk, alright you'll see how we handle punks"" they waited a hour to get the warrant which they didnt have at this point, open the package for the first time and test it on the spot, it turned a weird color that didn't match anything really - but thanks to the analog act its all up to interpretation they had no idea what was in the package when they arrested me, they just figured it was drugs but didnt know for sure. He said what they usually do is, once they suspect the package of containing drugs, get a drug dog to sniff it and or get a warrant to open the package before delivery, then test it, then if it is drugs, they put in a device that detects air. THEN they deliver that package, and wait until you open it, when the device hits air, it goes off, they're notified then they bust in.I got too relaxed, I saw an obvious hiccup in the delivery and shadyness of not leaving a ""sorry we missed you"" pink slip, which means they wanted me to be there when it was delivered, i hate myself for not trusting my gut instinct at that moment, but i learned and i can help you guys to help prevent it from happening to you1. spread out your packages of course, too many to one place creates a pattern which is what they look for no doubt2. try to make sure your vendor changes his return address, this was from a china factory which had the same return address as other busts, BUT they didnt say a thing.. about the 20 packages of real MDMA that I got from Germany, they had no clue. I had 15 kilo sized packages from china delivered, but they only mentioned knowing about 3 of them from the place with the same return address3. seriously, get to know your mail man... I knew my guy. old fat guy, make friends, leave them nice tips on holidays, if you get close enough they may even leave packages there without asking you to sign. this helps even more when you noticed it is not your mail man and possibly a cop.... this isnt my mail man, umm who are you, where is chris, is it his day off... hmm4. If you can, this will be an awesome trick, try to find out what your postal inspector looks like, imagine knowing exactly what the ""undercover"" guy will look like. If you see him, its game on and you say  - that is not mine, i did not order this go away.. they can CD if they want but any laywer will win that case in a second. do a google search for your postal inspector or maybe do something to try to meet him in person for some reason ""my mail is being stolen, i demand to speak to the postal inspector in person"" something so you can see the guy that may one day be handing you a package trying to arrest you and put you in a cage ""jail""5. Don't be there the day your tracking says out for delivery.. we all know that when a package you need to sign for is being delivered, and no one is home, they leave a pink ""sorry we missed you"" paper. On this paper you have options. 1 - go to the post office to pick it up ""nah fuck that"" 2 - re-deliver ""Yes please"" once you sign that paper, they should have no problem leaving it there because now its been signed for, you just work during the day and are not home to sign or go to the post office, sign for it and say (re-deliver, leave the package at door or in the mail box). I have done this before but I did not even consider making it routine..  I wish I did. Obviously they want to be there to see you sign for and accept it so they can arrest you on the spot6. Assuming you got the package, the mail man just left and you even waited a bit after writing on it ""wrong address, return to sender"" for a day or two. There is always the possibility that, for a fact, they do use little tracking devices that will alert them when you do open the package. This will be tough, how to avoid that possibility. my best and only idea to avoid this is to write on the package ""return to sender"" which shows proof that you did not intend to open it, and take a ride around town for a bit, do some errands, shop, go to walmart, if they see you leaving with it or see the tracking device leave, they most likely will now allow this - if they do pull you over and arrest you.. your very confused, you were just on your way to the post office to return this package you didnt order that has ""return to sender"" written on it. nice.. they fail.. but - if you do not get pulled over soon, its either 1 of 2 things. 1 - the package is safe and your prevention tactics feel like stupid paranoia, or 2 - they may be watching to see if you go to another house, maybe your bringing to hand it off to someone else aka the bigger fish which they would love to get too. after driving around, find a off-road dirt trail or something where you can go on a deep ride or walk into the woods with the package unopened and open it there, if there is a device that alarms when opened, fuck that thing, smash it with a rock, bury it or throw it in a lake, then run far and hide the drugs in another spot and get out of there clean.So, after this all happened to me, while sitting in the cell that night, all of this runs through my mind.. There are ways to beat it. Just shut up, don't say a word, they'll try to scare you but never consent to shit and you have no idea where it came from or whats in it, thanks to Tor, they can never prove who sent it or who ordered it, the package magically showed up at your door. http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php â¦ 379.0.html

My biggest fear. Damnit, why can't drugs at least be decriminalized? I don't hurt anybody. Many of us don't. We go to work, school, live responsible lives and follow the rules - apart from drugs. But really, who are we hurting? This War on Drugs is a failure.

Old copy/paste from AgI have looked all over the place on the DN and various different forums and threads in search of a detailed how to guide on washing your cocaine to its more pure form, free of cuts. I was able to find this detailed tutorial on a drug info site, this is copy/paste I do not take any credit for this. I just wanted to supply the information. I have also not personally used this method yet do to the fact of not having any samples to work with, I will however in time return to this thread and confirm my success with this procedure. I hope this helps someone, and please if you have another method you use or would like to comment on this one, by all means do. Everyone is entitled to their opinion in this community and the more we hear from each other, the better we can make this place, Namaste friends.AN EASY, NO CHEMISTRY BACKGROUND GUIDE TO CLEANING YOUR COCAINE FROM LEFTOVER MANUFACTURING IMPURITIES, UP TO REMOVAL OF EPHEDRINE, PSUEDOEPHEDRINE AND AMPHETAMINE..........................Do you find that your cocaine is, for the most part, a hard hitting, edgy, ampy, non-social, uncomfortable, paranoid, heart racing, tweaked out, geeked out, introverted, and just plain miserable buzz? Well, it's not supposed to be. Really clean cocaine is actually the exact opposite of all of those things. In fact, good cocaine is the most euphoric, sexual, talkative, clarifying, and empowering, center of the universe, can do no wrong, immediate anti-depressant kind of drug there is. You can actually do great coke for 3 days straight while never feeling geeked out or tweaked out. Good coke just doesn't do that to you. You crave very little and you do a lot less than you would with adulterated coke. Hard to believe, but it's true. I personally started doing coke in the 80's when ampy coke just didn't exist. You really don't think coke became so popular for making its users feel like shit, did you? Well folks, I'm glad to announce that the remedy is finally here! Now anyone can enjoy great cocaine with just a few simple steps. If youâre tired of getting crappy ass cocaine and look forward to doing all that real cocaine was ever advertised as, then please read on!GENERAL CLEANING OF COCAINE VIA A SIMPLE ANHYDROUS ACETONE WASH***UPDATED 11/1/06***This entire thread has been updated from the original theories mentioned at the bottom of this thread that pertain to amphetamines, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine. It is with almost entire certainty that most (not all, but estimate around 90 percent) of all cocaine does not contain any of these adulterants at all.It is important that you not only read this section first, but in addition, try this step first before trying any of the outdated and more advanced techniques mentioned near the end of this thread pertaining to the removal of amphetamines, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. I no longer feel that those substances are in most street level cocaine.It has come to my attention thru extensive personal and shared testing and research, that a simple anhydrous (water and alcohol free) acetone wash of your adulterated cocaine will most likely be the only cleaning required to give you the cocaine that you've always desired. Please note that the acetone wash does not remove amphetamine, ephedrine, or pseudoephedrine, but there again, it most likely doesn't contain any of those to begin with. Performing this easy procedure correctly should give you exactly what you've been looking for all along.........GREAT COCAINE!I have personally come to believe that additional alkaloids, in addition to the cocaine itself, leftover from a rushed and unfinished final cleaning at the manufacturing point, tend to mimic those of speed when combined together.Therefore, we must complete the very last manufacturing step of cleaning the cocaine in order to obtain the precious, pure and clean cocaine that we were looking for in the first place. This last step is so easy to perform and is the exact way it was supposed to be performed at the manufacturing point. It's called, THE ACETONE WASH!At the very final step of manufacturing, the cocaine hydrochloride crystals (the kind you snort), are supposed to be washed with acetone or diethyl ether to remove impurities and additional alkaloids left behind to obtain pure and clean cocaine hydrochloride crystals. But, in a hurried process, this step is sometimes rushed, thus leaving behind additional, unwanted alkaloids, or left out altogether, thus leaving behind all kinds of other crap! There is also the fact that leaving these unwanted behind adds additional weight to the final product, thus creating more money (the real motivation) for the manufactures. So therefore, it is now our job to finish the uncompleted process ourselves. The best thing about this procedure is that your cocaine will stay as a solid in the acetone and at all times while your other excess and unwanted alkaloids, plus other leftover byproducts will be dissolved and filtered away with ease.One final note: There is a quick and easy method to determine whether or not your adulterated cocaine actually contains amphetamine. Simply fill a tall drinking glass with regular Clorox bleach. Drop approximately one line worth of your adulterated cocaine into the bleach. After about 10-15 seconds, cocaine will start to fall to the bottom in swirling white trails, leaving no residue by the time it hits the bottom. You will be left with a small, yellowish looking oily residue left floating on top. After a minute or two, amphetamine will turn into an oily reddish (not orange) residue on top and my even leave trails of red in the bleach. Otherwise, your cocaine does not contain amphetamine.Additional ""caines"" other than cocaine, will leave behind an oily orange residue left floating on top. This is not uncommon and may likely be the case as many ""caines"" are used to adulterate cocaine due to their numbing qualities. But, additional ""caines"" other than cocaine itself are considered ""inactive"" cuts and do not alter the true effects of the cocaine. It is important to know that out of the some 100 different types of caines (procaine, lidocaine, benzocaine, tetracaine etc.), all add numbness, but do create euphoria. THE ONLY ""CAINE"" THAT CAN PRODUCE EUPHORIA IS COCAINE. If you experience no euphoria from your product, it most likely contains no cocaine at all. And yes, this does occasionally happen.......occasionally. If using cocaine on a regular basis, it is best that you learn how to detect not only the actual presence of cocaine in your purchase, but the percentage as well. This is not a thread on how to determine the presence of, or the percentage of, so you may want to read up on the bleach test, EZ white test, foil test etc. to become more familiar with on site testing before you make your purchase.Bare in mind that amphetamine seems to be most commonly found in European samples and rarely in U.S. Therefore, the acetone wash is mostly recommended for U.S. samples. That being said, let's move on.........................Items you'll need to perform the acetone wash99-99.5% or higher %, ACS grade or higher purity acetone (any online chemical supply company)Plastic funnel, 3-4 in. diameter top (any auto parts store)Medium to high flow filter papers, 16 cm. in diameter (any online chemistry supply company)50 ml. and/or 100 ml. glass Pyrex beaker and a 6 inch glass stir rod (any online chemistry supply company)Tall drinking glass, small enough in diameter at the top to hold your plastic funnel in place (your own kitchen)IMPORTANT! DO NOT USE BEAUTY STORE ACETONE. THIS PARTICULAR ACETONE NOT ONLY CONTAINS WATER AND/OR ALCOHOL, BOTH OF WHICH YOUR COCAINE WILL COMPLETELY DISSOLVE IN.YOU DO NOT WANT THAT. THEREFORE, YOU MUST PURCHASE 99-99.5% OR EVEN HIGHER PURITY ACETONE VIA ANY ONLINE CHEMICAL SUPPLY COMPANY. IT'S EASY TO ORDER AND IS NOT A WATCHED ITEM. MAY I SUGGEST WHEN ORDERING, YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER ONLINE, THUS AVOIDING HAVING TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN PERSON.Not to worry, if you're unable or unwilling to obtain acetone via a chemical supply company, there is a legitimate alternative. You can make hardware or home store acetone anhydrous with just one small step.Simply purchase a 1 liter container of acetone from home depot, Lowes, Menards etc. while there, also purchase a bag of Epsom salt.When you get home, preheat your oven to 400 degrees f. spread some Epsom salts over some aluminum foil placed on a baking sheet. Bake the Epsom salts for about 2 hours.This will turn your Epsom salt into anhydrous magnesium sulphate powder. Scrape up about 10 grams of the newly produced magnesium sulphate and pour it into your 1 liter container of home store acetone. Shake well. Let stand for 24 hours. The magnesium sulphate will absorb any water or alcohol and then sink it to the bottom in the form of a clump of goo.Your home store acetone is now anhydrous.IMPORTANT: as to not get any of the goo from the bottom when using this acetone, always use a glass eye dropper (any drugstore.....must be glass and not plastic!)) To extract the acetone from as close to the top as possible. First, squeeze the top of the glass eye dropper completely and simply insert it down about 3 inches into the container, release the top and let it suck up as much acetone as possible. Repeat as many times as necessary to obtain the amount you need.IMPORTANT: never pour the acetone into your beaker. Thatâs why we're using the glass eye dropper. All of the goo at the bottom of the acetone can, which was once water/alcohol, is just lying there. You certainly don't want any of that in your beaker. So, in addition, Iâd advise throwing away your acetone container when you've used up only 1/3 of it and start over with a fresh can and fresh anhydrous magnesium sulphate. Theyâre both extremely cheap, so it's no big deal.That's it! Ready, let's go............................Okay, please note that I'll be using 3 grams of adulterated cocaine as my example for this procedure, so keep that in mind. You should use 15 ml.s of acetone per every 1 gram of cocaine.Crush up your 3 grams of adulterated cocaine as fine as possible. I have personally found that using a fine screened juice strainer best for getting finely ground powder.Pour your crushed up cocaine into 45-50 ml.s of acetone. Put the cap back onto your acetone bottle immediately to avoid any moisture from the air getting in. Stir the cocaine in the acetone for approx. 3-5 minutes making sure to get around the bottom edges etc. Cover with a small piece of paper or something to keep any moisture out and let settle until the cleaned cocaine crystals are on the bottom and your acetone at the top has become completely clear or dirty looking, but free of any crystals floating in it. This should take anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes.Now, carefully pour your dirty acetone into a filter placed inside of your plastic funnel and resting atop your drinking glass. It is important on this first run to stop as short of any cocaine falling out into the filter as possible (it's okay if some crystals fall into the filter paper, leave them there). This will provide us with the opportunity to perform a second wash on the crystals in the beaker. Now, with some crystals stuck to the side of the beaker from pouring and most at the bottom, pour 30 more ml.s of fresh acetone into the beaker trying to collect those crystals stuck on the side while pouring in. Stir again and cover. This time, pour your entire contents into the filter paper. If some crystals are left clinging to the beaker, pour a lil' fresh acetone in, swirl and pour them in as well. With your clean crystals inside the filter paper, cover. Once all or most of the acetone has drained thru into the drinking glass, pour 20 more ml.s of fresh acetone into the filter paper. This will provide us with the third and last cleansing. Cover and let drain completely. This could take 5-10 minutes at the most.Once all of the acetone has drained thru, carefully remove the filter paper containing the newly cleaned and now beautiful crystals and place it between three or four paper towels. Fold the towels over the filter paper and press firmly on the cocaine to absorb any additional acetone. Discard paper towels and place the somewhat dried filter paper still containing the crystals under a heat lamp for approx. 20 minutes. Remove from under heat lamp.Now, this last step is very important. For your own health and for the true taste, feel and aesthetics of the newly cleaned cocaine, you must let it evaporate on its own, still inside of the filter paper for at least 24 hours in a non-humid environment. At the 24+ mark, gently heat the crystals, while still inside of the filter paper, for approx. 10 minutes or so. Remove from heat.Carefully open the filter paper and let the clump of beautiful cocaine fall out onto an awaiting ceramic plate. Rub the filter paper together over the plate if any is stuck to it. Carefully open up the clump to examine your newly formed, clean and pure crystals. This will resemble nothing of which you started with, no matter how good or bad it looked.Crush up finely into a couple of lines and snort away. ""HOLY SHIT, there's no burn, no smell, but wait a minute, I'm starting to feel a warm rush throughout my entire body!"" ""I'm feeling an extreme euphoria coming over me"". ""The back of my throat is numb as hell"". ""I feel fucking great""! ""No edginess, ampyness or uncomfortableness. I've never felt this good before"". Or any other quotes something of the like all thru the night anyway................=DWelcome to ""real"" cocaine..........finally! Enjoy.REMEMBER, 99-99.5% acetone is the only acetone that will work. In addition, I would also recommend adding about 10 grams of anhydrous magnesium sulphate to a 4 liter bottle of chemical company acetone, just as you did with the hardware store stuff. Remember, if your acetone is not COMPLETELY 100% anhydrous, you WILL lose some cocaine, it's that simple. So therefore, if youâre not getting 100% pure anhydrous acetone from a chemical supply company, you need to add some anhydrous magnesium sulphate to it as well. I'll give you an example: Just 1 gram of cocaine hydrochloride (the kind you snort), will entirely dissolve in just 1 ml. of water.You must also let it evaporate on its own for at least 24 hours. If you do this just as I described, it will work perfectly. Don't come to me and say it didn't work, but I used hardware store acetone. It has to be done exactly as I've described or you may as well do it dirty. :\ Link to freebase/crack guide with history of medical conditions from smoking; https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cocain â¦ nfo1.shtmlhttp://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/394052-FAQ-CrackLink(s) to history/production from coca leaf to cocaine; https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/ â¦ ction.htmlMore details on processes for growing/making and testinghttps://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/ â¦ pter8.htmlLink to freebase converted back to hcl, which also include the use of acetone washes;https://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.php?ID=3151

PGP In Plain English: A Simple Man's Guide To Using PGP/GPG Like A Pro.Hello. After reading a thread on users supporting the use of igolder, I realized that this community and a few others need to know how to properly encrypt their messages so they don't compromise their security for a ridiculous reason. This was previously posted on the hub but am now putting it here for the sake of helping the members in this community. I have noticed a lack of proper tutorials on how to use PGP/GPG. I also noticed that the ones which did exist focused on using a GUI application. As an alternative this tutorial will describe the in's and out's to securely and easily using PGP/GPG to encrypt communications, using a terminal interface, so one can maintain anonymity on tor and make sure only intended parties read the messages created. This is a guide on how to encrypt messages via the Gnu Privacy Guard, and does not detail the inner workings, nor signing. ===Terminology===First and foremost, there are two different common forms of asymmetric encryption on the deep web that is mentioned; PGP, and GPG. both are more or less the same thing. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy.GPG refers to the more trusted GnuPG, which stands for GNU Privacy Guard.As stated earlier, the two are considered very similar to one another, differing mainly in development and trust. This guide recommends the use of GnuPG, and will be using it.A keypair is the combination of public and private keys that form your ability to securely send messages. Your keypair will consist of your public key; the one you share with everyone else, and your private key; the one you keep to yourself and never distribute.ASCII Armor is the use of ASCII characters to display the encrypted data instead of using a .gpg file. This is desirable when sending messages using PM systems. ===Installation===This guide will be using GnuPG, it can be downloaded from the following link (WARNING: CLEARNET LINK) https://www.gnupg.org/index.htmlIf you are running TAILS, GnuPG should already be installed. Once there, go ahead and download a stable release for the OS of your choosing. The application comes with GUI applications, and you are welcome to install them, but throughout this guide we will be using the terminal/command line instead. You can test to ensure the installation was successful by opening a terminal/cmdPrompt and typing the following command:gpg --helpA large amount of text including command arguments should display itself on the console, this indicates the installation was successful.===Generating a keypair===Before we can encrypt a message, we are going to need to generate a keypair. You only need to do this once. to do this, enter the following command:gpg --gen-keyThe following text will then be prompted:gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.26; Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1The main difference between RSA & DSA and Elgamal is the underlying mathematical principles, for this guide we'll be using RSA. Enter 1 and hit enter. Next prompt:RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096Technically you should be safe at 2048, but I would recommend the use of 4096 for the added security. Next prompt:Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 1yIn the world of privacy, permanent anything is usually looked down upon, so I would recommend setting some length of time. For this tutorial my key will last for 1 year. To do this I enter 1y. Next prompt:Key expires at 12/12/15
Is this correct? (y/N) yI entered y, as it was the correct amount of time. The next prompt will ask for each of the following one at a time. The only field you actually need to fill out is real name. In that category put whatever you want. The Email address and comment are optional.GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: WhatEverNameYouWant
Email address:
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    ""WhatEverNameYouWant""

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? OModification options are given, but I'm satisfied with my entry, so I entered O to progress further.You will then be presented with a prompt to enter a passphrase. Pick a good one and move on. You will then be presented with the following message:We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
gpg: key CA637B79 marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.Basically hit a bunch of keys on your keyboard, and click around a bit until it finishes generating random information. Once done, you should receive some form of confirmation, and return to the console. At this point you will have successfully generated a keypair that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.===Getting your public key===At this stage you now have your own keypair; the next step is to retrieve your public key so you can distribute it for others to use when messaging you. In this tutorial, we created a user under the ID of WhatEverNameYouWant. This is the ID which I shall use. To print the key, enter the following command:gpg --armor --export WhatEverNameYouWantwhere WhatEverNameYouWant is the ID or Email picked when creating the keypair. This will print the public key to the console screen, if you want it instead to save it to a file the following command can instead be entered:gpg --armor --output myPubKey.asc --export WhatEverNameYouWantWhere myPubKey.asc is the name and directory path of the file to save it to. This can be opened with a text editor, and the public key can be copied.Here is the WhatEverNameYouWant public key that it displayed:-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----===Importing someone else's public key===To encrypt a message for someone, you're going to need to import their public key. Like generating a keypair, you only need to do this once. For this tutorial I will be importing the public key provided on Agora's help and info page. You are more than welcome to import the public key displayed earlier. The first step is to copy the public key to a text file. Once that is done, enter the following command: gpg --import pubkey.ascwhere pubkey.asc is the file where you saved the public key you want to import. Here's the output you should receive:gpg: key (Expunged): public key ""Agora One"" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)And that's it, you can now write messages using the key imported.===Encrypting a message===Once you have imported someone else's public key, you can encrypt a message. For this tutorial, I will use the text Hello World! and place it into file myMessage.txt .Now that we have a file with a message in it, enter the following command:gpg --armor --output encMessage.asc --encrypt myMessage.txtwhere myMessage.txt is the name of the file you are encrypting. Throughout this tutorial, there has been use of other parameters before encrypting the message. Let's take a minute and examine the parameters set forth. Notice that we use --encrypt and then the file name to specify the file to encrypt, but there are a few other parameters not fully described.--armor tells the program to use ASCII armor, this makes GnuPG encrypt the data in the file so it can be copied and pasted via text characters.--output enables the user to specify a name and location of the output file, where encMessage.asc is the desired name of the output file. So once that command is input, the user will be prompted to enter a recipient. As seen earlier, the user ID for Agora was Agora One. So that is what I entered. Alternatively, the user's email can also be entered. After that, I simply hit enter to confirm no other recipients.This is what the console looked like: You did not specify a user ID. (you may use ""-r"")

Current recipients:

Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: Agora One
gpg: (Expunged): There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user

pub  (Expunged)/(Expunged) Agora One
 Primary key fingerprint: (Expunged)
      Subkey fingerprint: (Expunged)

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.

Use this key anyway? (y/N) y

Current recipients:
(Expunged)/(Expunged) ""Agora One""

Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line:I just added this key from agora, so I am well aware that it is the actual user ID, therefore I can trust it, and input y and preceded on. Needing no other recipients, I simply hit enter and let the program compile an encrypted message. Upon completion, the file encMessage.asc was generated. When opened with a text editor, the PGP message was shown. This is the message which I would send to the recipient, in this case it would be the Agora staff.===Decrypting a message===So at this stage you can now generate your own keys, and send messages to others using their keys. The only thing left is to decrypt a message when a user messages you. This is the text Hello World! when encrypted using the WhatEverNameYouWant public key:-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----Decrypting this is a relatively painless and simple process. First I saved the message to a text file titled myEncMessage.asc. Once there I entered the following command:gpg --decrypt myEncMessage.ascwhere myEncMessage.asc is the name of the file with the message in it. This command will have it output the message into the console, if you want it to be placed into a file instead, use the following command:gpg --output myDecMessage.txt --decrypt myEncMessage.ascWhere myDecMessage.txt is the name of the file to export the message to.The decryption process requires accessing the private key; for this reason, you must provide the password you created when generating the keypair. During the process a prompt will appear, fill in the password and it will decrypt. Here is the output of the command with no output file specified:You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: ""WhatEverNameYouWant""
4096-bit RSA key, ID , created 2014-12-12 (main key ID)

gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID , created 2014-12-12
      ""WhatEverNameYouWant""
Hello World!Notice how a recipient is never specified, this is because the ciphertext can be linked to a key automatically. If the user has a message and the appropriate key to decipher it, GnuPG will find it on it's own.===Kudos===Here are a few extra useful commands that the GNU Privacy Guard provides:gpg --list-keysThis command lists all public keys stored on the machine.gpg --list-secret-keysThis command will do the same, but with private keys.If you want to change a key to a trusted one, enter the following command:gpg --edit-key WhatEverNameYouWantThe following will then appear:

[ultimate] (1). WhatEverNameYouWantAnd that's that.===Wrapping Up===This tutorial taught the fundamental usage of using assymetric encryption via a terminal/command prompt. Although more time consuming and tedious, I consider it advantageous over a graphical user interface. Using a GUI such as kleopatra for windows enables the user to see keys and click to interact with them, however it imposes restrictions such as forcing the user to enter an Email address. Using a terminal also ensures you know exactly what is happening to the keypair, and have full control. There's positives and negatives to using both.

I had posted these questions in the thread I am always in (heroin vendors) and then decided it was probably better suited here...please someone help me out..I need the info in a hurry...I got the bitcoins through localbitcoins..now I dont know what to do to safely get them to my account here so that I can use them asap and get a desperately needed order going...so please, anyone..I would really appreciate your help...As far as remaining annonymous and for security, I assume that you all are on TOR and not the clear net when you use localbitcoins, right? And is your email that you use to sign up and communicate regarding localbitcoins a really secure one such as safe-mail? And do you only access your safe-mail (or whatever email you use in this manner) while on TOR? And when you have the btcs sent, do you send them straight to here (BB market) or do you send them somewhere else first? If you are on TOR while using localbitcoins, do you have problems with having to sign in again and again due to your IP address constantly changing? What important info would I need to know to be safe (annonymous)--besides the obvious-- using localbitcoins site?I just really need to get some btcs and I have always, always, in the 2 years that I have been using DNMs bought my btcs by trading a MOneypak type card for them through a vendor on a site..and since I am having a lot of trouble finding anyone who is able to do this very quickly these days, I have to find a new method.Any help or tips or advice is very much appreciated...I cannot wait any longer as I am in dire straights to get some product ordered today asap...so I look to all my fellow h users here to help a girl out...

Not the same as local bitcoin, but you can check out www.bitcoin-otc.com (clearnet)You basically join an IRC channel and people buy and sell BTC live for lots of things, moneypak included, along with paypal, usd, etc.The service is anonymous if you use tor etc to connect to irc and you can transact as quickly as you find someone willing to do business with you. You'll also need a pgp key to identify yourself so you can get rated and give ratings. It's quite a nice site to use, but it requires a bit of know-how to fully appreciate it

I know this thread is old, but I just got here. TTH, you need to withdrawal from LBC to a wallet on your computer (ie. Electrum, Bitcoin-QT, Armory, etc.) and then from there you can deposit to anywhere you'd like. It's just not a good idea to withdrawal straight from LBC to the market. Yes, you do everything over tor.

It is also possible to buy them on the clearnet then mix them using a service like BTCfog(although Iv'e heard them and possibly others could be selective scammers) and have them sent to a wallet, like the one included with tails, ect.I'm sure its safer all around to buy anonymously with cash on LBC and using only TOR, but there are other ways.

Get a blockchain.info (tor) account, move some money there, then transfer what you intend into Grams (tor again) and then use their tumbler to load up your favourite market, it's not rocket science  Save as much as possible and don't leave money lying around on the markets as it seems to disappear real quick.M

Well buying btc isn't illegal. If you are a buyer and not a vendor, just send to a tumbler and then to Blackbank wallet. Takes few hours more but will muddy the waters sufficiently if you are just buying for personal use. LBC>tumbler>blackbank. Eta maybe 3-4 hours due to waiting for the blockchain. If you need to get them in faster to catch the same day post or something, just skip the tumbler. But if the person you buy from from LBC gets investigated your blackbank wallet address will be logged and checkable. Wouldn't worry too much with low amounts like .5g and 1g orders though.

I'm a Grams helix user all day. They don't even tumble the coins instead they give you completely fresh ones which is great. You do not want there to be a trail from any wallet you made a purchase from directly into your BB wallet. It doesn't matter if you are on Tor or clearnet because the blockchain can be followed. Using Grams Helix takes old coins and gives you brand new ones for a mere 2% cost with nothing previous on those coins. You can check the blockchains. Anyway, just some input.

Quite often, there seems to be some confusion on how Bitcoin works; it seems there is a general belief that the Bitcoins are stored in the wallet, but this is not true.  Before explaining the purpose of a wallet, it is important to first explain how Bitcoin works.The information of all the transactions are kept in the Bitcoin block which is computed by and kept by the miners.  This is why rewards are given to miners, as they are doing all the number crunching.  The rewards also promote more miners so there is a spread and no-single miner with less than around 40% of the mining power can cheat the numbers.So now we have the first part: Bitcoin Blockchain - The LedgerThe next important thing is how are funds moved around in the Bitcoin Blockchain, if Bitcoins are not moved in and out of the wallet?  In a simplified manner, Blockchain is actually a big list of addresses and the funds in them.  When funds are spent into an address, the Blockchain will write that the funds were put into the address or moved out of an address.On to the second part: Funding an AddressHow does the Blockchain know who owns the address?  In order to understand this, it is important to first understand what an address is.  An address consists of 3 parts (based on version 1 of Bitcoin Addresses).1. Private key2. Public Key : a hash of the private key3. Address : a hash of the public key with a checksum and then converted to base58(source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_ba â¦ addresses)Now that we know all 3 are actually related and unique to each other, we can see as we go from 1 to 3, there is a layer of security between each.  You can use a private key to recreate the public key and address, but not the other way around.  Now that we know what the keys are, we look at how it's used:In the third part: Spending1. Address: once a fund has been spent into the address, we now have a balance in the address2. Public Key: the public key is exposed to create a transaction when preparing to send3. Private Key: now to complete the transaction, the private key is used to sign and identify the rights to send the transaction created with the public keyAs can be seen, the private key identifies the right to spend from an address on the Blockchain, as the Private Key is used to derive the Public Key and Address.  Therefore, the private key just shows permission to move funds in the Blockchain for a specific address.Finally, we have the last part: The WalletIf a wallet does not hold Bitcoins, what does it hold?  A wallet is more similar in analogy to an account book that holds your account #s and passwords.  What the native Bitcoin-QT wallet client actually does is:1. Hold private key/public key/addresses to be used for moving funds in the Blockchain2. Connects and sends the transaction instructions accordingly3. Scan and keeps records of your transactions from the BlockchainSome wallets don't even do #3 as they use online sources for information about your account (as having a wallet with the full Blockchain can take up quite a bit of space and continue to grow - since it is a copy of all transactions in the ledger).Technically, you would not even need a wallet to access your funds.  You just need the private key for your address.  Cold storage is when funds are sent to an address where the private keys are not online or accessible by computer.This could be as simple as printing your public and private key onto a piece of paper, to saving it in a text file in your USB and sticking it in your drawer.  Without the private key, the address can not be accessed.If there are any questions or feedback in regards to how Bitcoin, Blockchain, Address/Public/Private Keys, and Wallets, please feel free to contact me at any time.Cheers,MDParityFounder of BlackBank

I think the whole concept is just genius. Like new coins are generated through miners verifying the transactions by finding hashcodes. There is almost beauty in this. Satoshi is a fucking genius!!I know it's not completely flawless, for example 51% attack. And I would have also made it that the last coin could never be mined, but the reward for breaking a hash would continue to decrease logarithmically below 1.But I guess he had his reasons.He is a legend...

It's not that difficult really, don't ship to people who you have a ""bad feeling"" about -  I know it sounds a bit cheesy but it's saved me more than once, trust your instinct.Don't compromise on security - NEVER!!! Treat ever order as it were going to Mars itslef! Ask before you ship and avoid high risk countries (like Finland, Norway and Australia for bigger items)Treat others like you would like to be treated yourself.Vendor - customer comms - keep the channel open. Especially when things are going wrong.Oh yeah, and sell what you advertise, nothing worse that getting one thing and expecting another.ALWAYS USE PGP FOR ADDRESSES, if someone decides to send you theirs in cleartext inform them of their mistake.A couple of my pennies of advice, welcome to hear more.

Well be certain of one thing.The walls of Jerhico are brought down from the inside.I said this in a previous post but.that was before I seen this thread.CAP off your mebership once it hits a certain number. Bigger is not better in situations like this. Bigger just puts a bullseye on your back to be hunted and you must constantly be working on the site for the influx of new members. Preventing you from.enjoying the fruits of your labor.Keep the member ship small anf with a yearly reopening to ten thousand new members and it not only keeps the site managable on a level the mods and owners can enjoy their profits but it adds a certain pristige to the BlackBank and it will make it the go to site everyone wants to belong to.As said previously I pitched thos same idea back on SR1 in march/april of 2012 and they stuck with being gready wanting the most members possible. I hope some people have learned from their mistakes.Don't be/get gready and keep the membership at a large enough level that the site and vendors make money but small enough it wont be the site labeled Public Enemy Number 1.For the record I love Bb. It is my favorite site since SR1. great GUI. Everyone seems mature and buisiness like.. Lets strive to keep it this way.

In response to the 'Deep Web Saftey Rules' discussions on Reddit, there was a topic about GPG signing.NOT_BRIAN_POSEHN wrote:This is one of the reasons you should only key sign messages which are short and essential. There are people on the darknet and some even on the clearnet who GPG sign pretty much every damn message they write for no reason. That's just leaving a verified paper trail if you write in an unusual way or mention specific interests like DPR did.For those who use PGP encryption, signing a message means including a signature in the message to identify the sender of the message.  In normal circumstances, when a message is encrypted with a recipient's public key, there's no way to identify the real sender.  Signing a message before sending it ensures the recipient that it was from the actual sender and not an impersonator.However, signing all messages is a double-edged sword.  It ensures the recipient that the sender is verified, but this also means if the messages were compromised, it verifies the sender in connection to any illicit or illegal activities attached to the messages. This would suffice for any prosecutor to convince beyond reasonable doubt.In best practices, only sign messages that is critical to identify yourself to the recipient.  In other cases, if it's not as important, it's best not to sign every single message as if the recipient was compromised and you were traced, the insurmountable evidence would ensure your verdict.

A SOCKS5 proxy is designed to make it look like you're a regular computer user in a given area.  It offers no anonymity in itself as the SOCKS provider sees your direct connection to their servers and thus has the info necessary to ID you.A VPN is in theory designed to provide some degree of anonymity by usually randomizing your apparent IP from a list of servers they rent or host in various locales.  If you choose a good one that keeps minimal logs (such as Mullvad) connect to one of the non-US servers, then to Tor, then finally to a SOCKS 5, you have a decent but flawed setup for anonymous action.

There r many factors to consider like what u r ordering and in what quantity. Holland is notorious for being a marked country importing to the states. That is why many dutch vendors won't ship to the U.S.  The UK is increasingly becoming more risky in light of DM related busts. You need to research the vendors. How many successful transactions to the U.S. does the feedback and forums indicate? Are you ordering 200 blister packed rattling pills, an ounce of stinky weed or a gram of mylar sealed cocaine - all things to consider. Is it schedule 1 or 4 on the DEA hit list? Will it ship in a discreet light envelope or a bulky package ? How popular is the vendor ? Are you a good gambler ? Does Thor smile upon you or hammer the with vengeance ?

It;s actually true. I have a lot of experience here.It depends on where YOU live mostly.. If you're Aussie, EVERY order is a high risk one.For me in the states, the list is exactly as you said. China is high risk right now.I would sat Canada isn't so much going out, but I hear theyre actually strict on what comes in. When it comes to international, do your homework, and then quadruple check it, and check forums and feedback about that specific vendors stealth. And when it comes to pills, try to avoid ordering more than like 200 at a time... Even though I've done like 5000, but they didn't rattle, and they were surprisingly well stealthed from my experiences with India.After my last International order (Aside from Ketamine from CanadianForger on Agora), was from GOTMILK. It took 3-4 months of constant harassment to get to me, and I'm AMAZED it cleared the checkpoint. Whoever was watching the line clearly didn't give a shit that day. The bag had holes in it for fucks sake... And this guy had a good rep...If you can do Domestic, ALWAYS go for that option even if it costs more... But when it comes to MDMA and stuff, if you want the real deal for a good price, you need to understand you're taking a very high risk. There's no exception to that. International shipments of stuff that dogs can sniff out is the highest risk thing you can do as far as I'm concerned. But hey, that's just my opinion...based on a lot of experiences.Even my beloved MarcelKetman was having trouble towards the end of evo, and he was the only person I trusted internationally aside from CanadianForger..Infinite

I've been on multiple markets and ordered from a bunch of countries. Both of these guys have excellent input. Personally if you order from a high risk place like China with it's RC, try to have multiple drops set up very tightly. Every new vendor of mine gets a new drop and after it's trusted I move order to my trusted drops. I have a sequence. After a while and still trusted I move them to an even more trusted drop. If one gets burned or I feel had a sketchy pkg then i torch the drop and all previous ones. China RCs I always space them and scatter them and order large real quick like 2 of them and then let that drop calm down for a good 5 months. i work through 3 different cities and all of them are box rentals. NOT PO BOXES!!! I mean shipping places that let you rent boxes therefore they sign for it and put it in my box. No contact for me IF they have to sign. I scout my drop locations for about 15 mins driving by and around looking at the cars and noticing anything out of place. Remember what cars are always in the areas so you'll notice anything new. Sometimes if I'm super paranoid I'll put the pkg in another box right there at the shipping place and pkg it up without opening it and send it to another location. Maybe even pkg it and put a diff mailing addy with a weird return and walk out the store with it. If anyone approaches me then the pk I'm carrying is not what they are looking for. Also I have a DBA as a personal courier service since no packages are ever in my name i'm simply picking up and delivering for a client. Here's my fake form for where I have to deliver the package... It's simply a drop at this sketchy location (have a story on hand) and I'm out of the clear. have an email set up where the request has been made, you can get detailed with this for a real good cover story. takes just a second to send from a fake email every time you go to the postal box. Once you start driving if they pull you, you're on the way to said place. There's a lot to keep yourself safe if you just think outside the box (no pun intended). I hope some of this info helps you and gives you some ideas. I've had a drop point raided and friends popped and a knock and talk.

More good points but much of this is relative. There is a big difference between ordering wholesale amounts of chemicals from China for redistribution and ordering something small for personal use. There are actually some international vendors I would feel more safe ordering from ( for personal use volume ) than some domestic vendors. Once you get into redistribution volume then the game completely changes. Those are interesting methods RedBullFan mentioned.

I've learned a lot through the years. btw get some vistaprint.com cards made up with ur name and ""courier service"" with your courierservice@email.com or whatever where you can easily show LE you're legit and even ""oh yes sir this is all the information right here, i'll help you as much as i can"" or whatever route you wanna take it. Also here is a link to a story i read and posted. it's not mine but worth the read! http://kth2mwuwlkezwziy.onion/fluxbb/vi â¦ 494#p27494Good luck!If LE took the time to set up a bust at a shipping place then that would mean they likely know the contents of the box. So I would be surprised if fake DBA courier papers would work. I assume they would check to see if the front business has legit LLC / corporation registration. Placing the package in a different package with new names and addresses sounds clever. But again, the mail clerk would likely be instructed to notify them if a targeted package is picked up. It just seems LE would either put a ridiculous amount of resources into the bust or none at all.

Avoid using a VPN with TOR. The VPN will know the IP address and location of your connection and even though it is being ran through TOR from there they can still give information to LE upon request. Stick with your home internet -> Tails -> TOR and PGP.

------- DISCLAIMER: I did not write this -------A lot of what went down with Xanax King is still sealed, but there are lots of little bits of information that have been given to the media. Reading all of the stories we can start to put together what happen.    Someone notices large scale distribution of ""fake"" Xanax on Agora, orders of 10,000+ pills are common. Notice XK is a big vendor.    LE make a number of controlled buys and work out that the vendor uses the same packaging and same drop point.    LE tour postal offices across the country with a full profile of packaging and teach workers how to pick out XK packages.    Packs go missing as postal workers start pulling them out of the lines. Correlates with complains of non-arrivals on the forums.    With the combination of controlled buys and orders being pulled off the line at sorting centers LE together with USPS quickly triangulate the drop location.    Stake out drop location, wait for the guy who visits every day and drops off the same 20+ packages a day.    Follow him, build evidence, grand jury, arrest.Lessons:    CHANGE UP your packaging frequently.    If packages go missing CHANGE UP again    Use different mailboxes to ship from, use different people, don't have one person carry all the packages the same day at the same timeFrom now on user vendor reviews should include, and this is important:    Make more than one order from the vendor. If the packaging was the same on all then you avoid them because they will be caught.    Make more than one order from the vendor. If the send location was the same on all then avoid using the vendor because they will be caught.I think this is a turning point arrest in that previously we would judge vendors based on a single order and their 'stealth' and 'delivery' where now that simply isn't good enough.Vendors who don't vary their packaging and send from the same area are endangering themselves and their customers.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[clearnet]http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/ â¦ anax_king/[/clearnet]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The bit about vendors using the same packaging seems like a very valid point. Some of the vendors I use haven't changed up their packing style or the return address style even if the address itself may vary. It seems like it would be good to change it all up every now and then, but this is coming from my ignorant customer-only standpoint

I don't think many vendors actually change up their stealth often.I've even bitched to vendors about lack of stealth and no moisture barrier bags and they always brush you off and nothing ever changes.Eventually it will catch up to them or their customers.I bet one day they do a massive sting on many vendors and customers.Vendors that don't heed proper stealth either don't care or are to stupid/lazy to change up substandard stealth.

It may be possible that they do not have the manpower to stop it all, or maybe they just need and like the business so it's sort of a don't ask/don't tell type of situation. Or maybe, and I hope not, they are just biding their time for a big operation at some point in the future against the big vendors and/or buyers.As of now it seems that only the biggest markets have been on LE's radar, but that should absolutely NOT be any excuse for complacency. They are patient and do not forget, and the statute of limitations is never short enough....(not to mention interstate commerce falls under federal jurisdiction)Ideally all vendors would use MBB's but at the very least, I think it would be good practice for them to continually change up stealth/packaging methods and return addresses and even actual mailing locations from time to time. I am admittedly just a ""lowly buyer"" and don't necessarily know what I'm talking about, but this is just sort of how I see things and if I can think of this stuff I'm sure law enforcement can too...

Hacking for Profit:Credit Card FraudA Beginners GuidebySA E.J. Hilbert IIFederal Bureau of InvestigationLos Angeles Field OfficeSanta Ana Resident Agency714-542-8825Written August 2002Revised December 20042IntroductionThis paper is intended to detail how financially motivatedhacking groups convert stolen data to monetary instruments. Theprimary premise for this paper is based on Eastern Europeanhacking groups but in recent months, the âfinancially motivatedâhacker sub group has expanded to include hackers from the Far andMiddle East Hackers. What the individuals are doing with theillicit profits of their activities range from childish purchasesto funding terrorist attacks as was detailed in the recentautobiography, âAku Melawan Terorisâ (Me, Fighting the Terrorists)by the Bali nightclub bomber. In the chapter âHacking, MengapaTidakâ (Hacking, Why not?), Iman Samura, a computer scientistprovides a primer to Islamic Extremists of how to learn the tradeof credit card fraud and hacking.To quote BigBoss, from forum.Carderplanet.com, âCardingshouldnât be something you do for fun, it is something you do tosurvive.âFinancially motivated hackers consider hacking and carding astheir career. The employment opportunities are in their homecountries, particularly those whose salaries are enough to pay forthe life styles these individuals have become accustomed, areextremely limited. They come from a society where the average payis $200 per month but Internet connectivity costs $40 per month.Thus they are willing to spend one fifth of their monthly salaryto be online. A $1000 profit is more money then most EasternEuropean hackers have ever seen at one time.Though they understand the process of credit cards, mostInternational hackers do not understand the impact of committingcredit card fraud. Most come from cash economies and the use of acredit card by regular citizens is extremely uncommon. They feelthe attack is directed at a big corporation and not an individual.The idea of rising interest rates, chargeback fees or economicinstability are not concepts they can understand nor are theytheir concern. Money is the object of their actions.At the time of the first version of this paper in August2003, many financially motivated hackers could be found chattingin the forums of the web sites carderplanet.com, shadowcrew.comand/or darkprofits.com. These sites are still referenced in this3paper because the information provided on the sites are stillrelevant.Since that time, many of the referenced sites have beenshutdown or taken over by script-kiddies and the real profiteershave moved deeper underground. Many have also become allied withorganized crime groups or created their own hacking teams.Also at the time of original publication, EFnet and DALnet onIRC initiated a crackdown on channels dedicated to cyber crime.Since that time, the criminals have found loop holes in thecrackdown, such as renaming the groups, attaching messages of theday (MOTD)forbidding criminal activity or making the channelsprivate. Many of the channels have also gone native; meaning theyare dedicated to a particular language group and all posts to thechannel utilize that language and the corresponding slang forcarding.The point being, the groups have not gone away. They stillexist and communicate on the Internet by adapting to the rules.Law Enforcement must now adapt in kind.By no means is this paper intended to be the end-allauthority on this crime. Comments, questions and revision arealways welcome.Definitions, Concepts and StatisticsSince the readers of this paper will range from skilledinvestigators to neophytes, some basic terms and concepts need tobe set forth:Hacker - Individual who gains unauthorized access to computernetworks and systemsCarder - Individual who uses stolen data, usually Credit cards, tofraudulently purchase items or convert the credit into cash.Credit card - a monetary instrument, often referred to as plastic,used in place of cash to make purchases. Credit cards areassigned to entities and have specific monetary limits and aninterest rate associated with payoff. Since credit cards do nothave to be paid off each month, the available limit willfluctuate. Visa or MasterCard does not issue Visa and MasterCardcredit cards. They are issued by an issuing bank in conjunctionwith a use agreement between the bank and Visa or MasterCard.4This agreement is for the use of the Visanet or the MasterCardequivalent for verification and authorization of the card.Charge card - same as credit card however, a charge card must bepaid off each month or risk an extremely high interest rate or thecard being shutdown.Debit Card - Card associated with a bank account and limited bythe amount of money in said account, which resembles the creditcard by the method of purchase.

In certain cases, the card memoryrenewal during each use (renewed account balance).LE - Law Enforcement, Coppers, Piggies, The FuzzzzzzzzzzzzLappie- LaptopCommunication MethodsAs in all endeavors, hackers and carders need a means orseveral means of communication. Given the international make-up9of most hacking groups and the fact of Cyber crime being trulyborderless, the communication methods chosen by these groups mustbe internationally accessible, cost effective and have a highlevel of anonymity. Listed below are several of the primarycommunications methods used by hackers and carders:IRC - Internet Relay Chat, a series of interconnected computerservers on various network which enable users to chat in channelsand one to one. The channels are also referred to as rooms andare controlled by the user who first established the room.ICQ - America Online (AOL) owned peer-to-peer chat application.Chat rooms can be established within the ICQ network but entranceis by invitation only.AIM- AOL Instant MessengerForums - Website sponsored bulletin boards where public andprivate messages can be posted about various topics. Examples:forum.carderplanet.com, eraser.hostmos.ru, www.darkprofits.comand www.carderclan.netEmail - Electronic mailA Credit Card (VISA) TransactionThere are two parts to every transaction. First, a customerpresents a Visa product, usually a card, to a merchant, who needsimmediate authorization of the transaction. Second, at the end ofthe day, the merchant needs to receive the funds for thetransaction via its financial institution and ultimately from thecustomerâs issuer. The specifics will vary depending ontransaction type, complexity, technology, and processing servicesbut the typical flow is illustrated here.How a Purchase is MadeAuthorization at the Point of SaleMaria presents a Visa card (credit or debit) at ABC Stores.ABC uses an electronic terminal or the telephone to request anauthorization from its financial institution (DEF MerchantServices).DEF checks to see if the account is valid and has sufficientfunds. It sends an authorization request message, including10ownerâs account, merchant account and transaction details, throughVisaNet to GHI Bank, Mariaâs Visa issuer.GHI reviews the request and makes a decision to approve ordecline the request. GHIâs response message is sent back throughVisaNet to ABC within seconds.In some cases, when an issuer is unavailable forauthorization, VisaNet will authorize the transaction as part of aStand-In Processing Service. This is done to further enhancepayment system efficiency. The entire authorization process, whendone electronically, takes about two seconds.How the Merchant Gets PaidClearing and SettlementAt the end of the day, ABC Stores delivers all its salesdraft information (including Mariaâs purchase) to DEF MerchantServices. Each draft will contain the credit card number and themerchant account number. DEF credits the merchant account of ABCStores for the net amount of all its sales. This is how ABC Storesobtains its funds from Mariaâs purchase.Next, DEFâs processing center creates an electronic versionof all drafts for all the merchants it supports, including ABCStores. The electronic drafts, which may include transactions fromnumerous Visa account holders in various countries, are sentthrough VisaNet to one of Visaâs data centers.Visa routes these drafts to the financial institutions of theVisa account holders, for instance
 Mariaâs transaction is sent toher issuing bank, GHI Bank. Visa consolidates all transactions foreach issuer into an electronic file that includes currencyconversions, fees, net settlement amounts, and required reportinginformation.GHIâs processing center receives the file and prepares thetransactions for posting to its cardholdersâ accounts includingMariaâs.GHI Bank transfers all the funds owed that day by itscardholders, including Maria, to a settlement bank, which isresponsible for delivering the funds to the merchant acquirerssuch as DEF Merchant Services. This is how DEF gets paid for theamount it paid ABC Stores in step #2.11At the end of the billing period, GHI Bank produces a statement toMaria. This is how GHI settles with Maria.StatisticsVisa annual worldwide sales volume exceeds US$2.4 trillion.There are 1.2 billion Visa, Visa Electron, Visa Cash, Interlinkand PLUS cards worldwide. But only 49,413 legally issued cards inCentral Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Visa is accepted in more than 150 countries.As of March 31, 2003, MasterCardâs gross dollar volume forcredit and debit programs was US$285.7 billion, an increase of7.31% over the same period in 2002.MasterCard has 32 million acceptance locations; no paymentcard is more widely accepted globally.Cardholders can obtain cash with the card at bank branches and atall ATMs in the global MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus ATM Network,among the largest ATM networks in the world with more than 892,000ATM locations worldwide on all seven continents.Most Eastern European law enforcement officers do not own,use or understand a credit card. This is important whenrequesting information from certain parts of the world. Allrequests must be highly detailed and precise.What to StealEverything is worth stealing to these individuals. Thesehackers are financially motivated and highly educated. They arenot the typical hackers found in the U.S. Hacking and Carding isa business for them. They hack to steal databases, which in turnare provided to carders. Carders, utilizing various schemesconvert the stolen credit cards to cash or equipment then, providethe cards freely online in carding related IRC chat rooms. Theintention of the free cards is to spread the information as widelyas possible thus making it difficult for law-enforcement to trackwho originally committed the hack.The hack occurs in three parts, reconnaissance, theft anddump. During the reconnaissance portion, the hackers stealeverything. This information is used to identify the importantparts of the network, the location of the databases and user namesand passwords. The reconnaissance usually occurs two to three12months before the theft. During the theft portion, the hacksbegin to glean specific information, i.e., credit card numbersfrom the system as needed. The theft phase can last for years andthe hackers usually leave a very small footprint of theiractivities. The dump stage occurs when the hackers stealeverything in a very ânoisyâ manner. This stage is used to burnall those âscript-kiddiesâ and âlamerzâ who are taking advantageof the original hackers backdoors. The dump phase usually resultsin press coverage and the âred-flaggingâ of all the credit cardsin the system at that point in time. The victim company makessecurity changes and over time lets their guard down. The hackersthen attempt to use the old backdoors they created. If they arestill in place, the theft stage begins again.The hacks normally take advantage of known vulnerabilities,which have not been patched by the various victims. Most hacksoccur against Microsoft Windows platforms and utilize the Msdacexploit, the MSSQL exploit or the IIS exploit. A wealth ofinformation is available about these exploits on the Internet.The truly skilled hackers have developed their own tools andplace backdoors on systems such as, installing Telnet and secureshell daemons on high port numbers or creating their own user idâsand passwords after installing a sniffer to steal the root levelpasswords. These are the first things System Administratorsshould look for, as well as changing all root level passwords viaface-to-face meetings with all root level users. Sending thechange of passwords via email will be intercepted if a sniffer hasbeen installed on the system.Sometimes, the hack is automated through the use of a âbotâwhich makes it impossible for the System Administrators of thevictimized networks to stop because they are physically not fastenough to fight the bot. The only way to stop the bot is to takethe network offline.Investigations thus far indicate the following items arebeing stolen for use in various schemes detailed later in thispaper:â¢ Credit card databasesâ¢ Personal information (name address telephone numbers)â¢ Bank accountsâ¢ Bank routing numbersâ¢ Social Security numbersâ¢ Email addresses and passwords13â¢ Computer logon names and passwordsâ¢ ACH transfer recordsâ¢ Merchant accountsâ¢ Order historiesâ¢ Client listsâ¢ Partner listsâ¢ Company telephone directoriesâ¢ Website Source codeâ¢ Shipment tracking numbersâ¢ Ebay accountsâ¢ Escrow accountsâ¢ Proprietary SoftwareGetting Credit CardsOf all the data sought by hackers, credit card databases arethe highest priority. This is because they are the easiest touse.There are nine basic methods to obtain credit card numbers:Phishing â This is the practice of sending fraudulent e-mails thatappear legitimate. The email often appear to be from a bank orfinancial institution and request the recipient update theiraccount information by utilizing the link included in the email.The link takes the recipient to a bogus web page where all therequested information is captured and later transmitted to a sitecontrolled by the criminal for their use in cyber crime. Amongstthe information often requested is the recipients social securitynumber, credit card number, PIN and cvv2.Buy â There are literally thousands of âVendorsâ on web sites suchas Forum.carderplanet.com, darkprofits.net and Shadowcrew.comwilling to sell dumps of credit cards at varying rates. If acarder knows how to use cards, expending $200 up front for cardsis easily recouped.Trade â Through the different communication methods discussedabove, hackers and carders trade credit cards online. Many cardsare offered free of charge. The individual who stole the cardsoften has used these cards for fraudulent purchases. They arethen offered to the community as a whole with the intention ofhaving multiple people use the cards. Law enforcement willtherefore have a harder time identifying the original hacker fromthe various carders.14Generate â There are numerous software packages freely availableon the Internet, which generate credit card numbers. Many of theprograms use the DESIII algorithm just like the legitimate creditcard companies.The problem for the carder with generated cards, is thatapproximately 1% of the cards are valid. This means the carderwill need to have access to obtain validity and authorizationbefore trying to commit fraud. A common method would be amerchant account.Visa and MasterCard do not issue or generate cards, howeverthey allow banks to issue cards with the respective logos/brands.American Express differs from Visa and MasterCard in this respect.American Express controls all cards and card numbers using theirlogo. American Express actually generates card numbers inadvance, which are stored in an active state awaiting issuance toa customer. If a carder generates one of the stored AmericanExpress cards, any merchant receiving the card for payment willreceive authorization for the purchase.Extrapolate â Once a Carder obtains a valid card through any ofthe different means listed herein, he can extrapolate additionalcards based on the valid card number and the expiration date.Various extrapolation programs are freely available on theInternet. These programs utilize the valid card as a base forcreating additional cards, particularly the first six digits.Extrapolation increases the likelihood of obtaining valid creditcards to approximately 35-40%. Once again a method to determinethe validity via authorization is required.Fake Shops â It seems every business must now have a presence onthe Internet in order to do business. Couple this fact with thegeneral publicsâ belief that web sites are not easy to set up. Itis not difficult to understand why many feel if the company has anice web site, the company must have money and be a reputablecompany. Many hackers and carders will use these beliefs to theiradvantage by setting up fake online shops offering products forsale at cut-rate prices. Good hackers and carders will spend theextra time to post fake recommendations on rating sites to helpmove their fake shop into the top ten slot on search engines.When customers place an order at the shop, they will be informedvia email, their product will be shipped in 4-6 weeks. While thecustomer is waiting for their product, the shop owners continue tocollect credit card numbers. At this point there are threepossible scenarios:15The first is that the product is simply not shipped and thecredit card is never charged. The second is the product is notshipped but the credit card is charged. In the third scenario,the product is shipped and the customer is happy. The details ofthis scheme will be covered in depth later in the paper but, inall three scenarios it should be noted, the hackers and cardersreceived legitimate credit card numbers with full information.Intrusions - The method of obtaining credit cards that hasreceived the most press is Intrusion. The hacker simply gainsunauthorized access to a system and steals the database. Thesystems targeted by hackers include the following:â¢ Online shops running shopping card programsâ¢ E-Commerce payment solution sites which handle online ordersfor online shopsâ¢ Credit Card processing companies such as Authorize.net,creditcards.com and CCBill.comâ¢ Online monetary exchange sites where a person can purchasemonetary units using credit cardsâ¢ Online Casinosâ¢ Pornographic websites (victim often do not notify LawEnforcement of intrusions)â¢ Banks and Financial institutionsEach of these targets will have credit card informationstored in some variation. Some will include full informationincluding CVV2 numbers while others will simply store the creditcard number and expiration date.Identity Theft - This method is labor and time intensive but, oncethe credit card is obtained, the card is valid and often has ahigh credit limit. Using stolen identities, the carder simplyapplies for a credit card. How the identities are obtained rangefrom simply web searches to buying access to ChoicePoint orLexus/Nexus gaining data from their databases.This scheme will also be covered more in depth later in thispaper.Social Engineering (SE) - By far the most low-tech method ofobtaining information, the hackers and carders will simply try toget the individuals to provide the information. This is donethrough telephone calls, faxes or email. A very common SE method16is the email sent to particular customers stating there is someissue with their account. The customer is asked to log on usingthe link contained in the email. Once the customer logs on, allthe information they input into the web site is collected for useby the hacker. When the individual selects the submit button onthe web page, a message stating some computer glitch appears andthe customer is asked to select the continue button which will redirectthe customer to the legitimate site and the customer reenterstheir information. This time, the proper site acceptswhichever change the individual makes, and the customer hasunknowingly provided the hacker/carder with full accountinformation.This method has been reportedly used for gathering email,Paypal, bank and credit card account information.The SchemesEach hacking and carding group try to develop their ownoriginal scheme to make money from the stolen data however, thereare several primary schemes for converting stolen data into cashor product upon which all the others are based. Below, the primaryschemes and a few widely used variations are detailed. It isimportant to note, the variations are only limited by theimagination and knowledge of the subjects.Sell - The easiest and quickest method to make money from stolencards is to simply sell them online. The sale of card data iscalled a âdumpâ in which the hacker/carder offers the data fortrade or sale, often track 1 and 2. The going rate online isapproximately $.35-$.50 for credit card numbers and expirationdates. Cards with full subscriber information and CVV2 numbersrange in price from $2.00 to $4.50. Also cards are sold based ontheir verified credit line i.e., $100 for a card with an availablecredit line of $10,000.Auction Fraud - Also an incredibly easy scheme, auction fraud hasbeen somewhat limited by the establishment of online escrowcompanies. But note, fake online auction companies can easily becreated as well. In this scheme, the subject simply posts a fakeauction item and sells it to the highest bidder. The buyer sendsthe seller money or a credit card number but never receives theproduct.A couple variations of this scheme are as follows:17A. The hacker/carder uses the stolen credit card to makepurchases of auction items. This can be done on a person-topersonsale or through the use of an escrow account. If anescrow account is involved, the hacker/carder will eitheropen an escrow account based on the stolen information orwill steal an escrow account and use whatever funds are inthe account to make purchases. The purchases will be shippedto a drop and picked up later by either the subject or hisassociate to be re-packaged and shipped elsewhere, usuallyoverseas. The use of a drop and an associate is called atrans-shipper. How trans-shippers are obtained is discussedlater.B. The second variation is more sophisticated and forces theescrow account to serve as a money laundering conduits. Thehacker/carder will open several escrow accounts, one based ona bank account controlled by the hacker/carder and the othersbased on stolen credit card or bank account information.Often times neither account is in the subjectâs true name.The real account is used to post numerous online auctions.The auctions take place for a limited period of time and thehacker wins his own auctions using one of the fraudulent accounts.This fraudulent account is then used to pay the escrow company.The seller informs the escrow account the product has been sent,the buyer states he received the product and instructs the escrowcompany to release the funds. The funds are transferred to thereal escrow account from which they are immediately withdrawn andtransferred to a bank account or withdrawn via an ATM. At no timeduring the transaction did any product change hands. All themoney was transferred via the escrow company thus, in 30-days whenthe card holders whose cards were used for the fraudulent accountsfile chargebacks, the chargeback is sent to the escrow company.Fraudulent Purchases - This scheme is also simple in that thehacker/carder simply makes a purchase online using the stolencredit card. The difficulty for this scheme is that merchantsoften will not ship overseas therefore, the subjects need anaddress within the U.S. to which to ship the product.On Fraudulent Purchases the hacker/carders need a drop, aperson or location to send the packages without identifyingthemselves. Drops can be obtained in various ways.A. The most common is to post on a hacker/carder forum the needof a partner and establish a working relationship withwhoever answers the postings.18B. Drops can also be obtained by posting a job offer onHotjobs.com or Monster.com for an individual to work at home.Individuals will be paid via Western Union to accept andrepackage items and send them overseas. A skilled SocialEngineer can convince people of the legality of acceptingpackages in this method and the newly hired employee isunaware they are facilitating a crime.When it comes to paying these employees, the hackers/cardersvary as well. Many will simply not pay their employees andleave them âholding the bagâ when complaints are filed.Others choose to pay their employees through Western Union.Still others act as if t
ey are paying the employee bysending them a counterfeit check. The checks will be drawnfor substantially higher amounts then are owed the newemployee. When the employee comments regarding the value ofthe check, the employer states it was an oversight and asksthe employee to simply wire the employer the remaining fundsafter the subtraction of the monies owed the employee plus abonus for being honest. The employee sends the wire transferoverseas and two to three days later finds out the check iscounterfeit. The employee is not only out their salary butadditionally the amount wired overseas.B. The third variation is called COB (change of billing). Mostcredit card companies allow their customers online access totheir account. With this online access, the customer canchange billing addresses; telephone numbers, passwords and soon. The intriguing aspect is that most people do notactivate their online access. When a hacker/carder steals acredit card with full information, they can then go onlineand change the billing address to match that of one of thedrops they control. The COB is extremely useful when thecompany the items are being purchased from, will only ship tothe billing address.C. If the drop is worried about having the packages shipped totheir address, P.O. boxes are used and an ingenious method isto send the packages to vacant homes. An individual cancontact a local real estate agent to determine which homesare for sale and when the occupants plan on moving out.During the brief time the house is vacant, the drop cansimply pick up the packages from the mailbox of the vacanthouse.19D. A final variation involves some sophistication, but it limitsthe need for an associate. When an item is fraudulentlypurchased, the hacker/carder has the package shipped to thecredit card holderâs real address. A slow shipment method isrequested as well as a fax or email of the scanned shippingbar code. When the hacker/carder receives a copy of theshipping bar code, they can utilize a bar code scanner toread the code. They then contact the shipping company,provide the information contained in the bar code and achange of the shipping location. The new cost for theshipment is billed to the defrauded company or can be chargedto another stolen credit card.Below is a post by a carder named JediMasterC detailing howto card in the real world based on dumps of credit cards obtainedonline or through skimming:Mon Jul 21, 2003 11:41 am Post subject: TUTORIAL - Carding with Dumps July 212003--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is dedicated to cumbajonny and other people who watch their backs closely.If you're that careful you will probably never be caught. The date in the topicwill be changed whenever there is an updateDisclaimerThis document was written for informational purposes only. It was written sothat credit card companies, banks, merchants, retail stores, and the consumerwill have a better understanding on how these activities work and how to protectthemselves. I have never participated in any of the described activities and amnot suggesting that anyone else should either. All described acts, memories,quotes, and ideas are fictional.IntroSo, you've heard all kinds of things about carding with dumps and you'reinterested, but you don't know where to start. Look no further than thistutorial. Written by JediMasterC for carderplanet.net, this tutorial will tellyou everything you need to know from beginning to end. Feel free to distributethis document, so long I am given credit. I can be contacted on CarderPlanet.Newbie WarningIf you are new to credit cards do not even think of doing anything here untilyou have more experience. It may seem easy (and it is), but you must havecertain mindset. The key to success, at anything in life, is knowledge and theability to apply your knowledge. Anything done in person takes a little morethan that. It takes presentation. It takes charisma. It takes charm. If you're apimply 16-year-old wearing cut offs and a sleeveless shirt, do you honestlythink that someone will believe you can afford a $3000 computer system? It'spossible, if you know how to act and what to say. As a newbie you know nothingabout the life, how ""carding"" works, how cards work, etc. Learn everything youpossibly can before you step out into the real world, and then start small.20How to startYou must have some money saved up in order to start in this business (or bereally good at online carding). I assume you have some sort of transportation, acomputer, and some brains. Let's take a look at a list of other things you willneed (all costs are approximate):Card encoder - Get an MSR206. It is the standard when it comes to encoders. Ihave heard that the AMC-722 works, but it will not last as long and will break.There are a few online places that sell the MSR206. I bought mine new with myown card and money. Cost: $725 new (around $500 used) Hard to card.Laptop - You may not need this to get started, but you'll find out quickly thatit will save a lot of time. If you don't have a laptop you will need to go homeevery time a card dies. I suggest the smallest, lightest laptop possible. Cost:$500-$2000, cardable.Serial to USB Adaptor - Most encoders are serial based (including the MSR206),and most small laptops don't have serial ports. Get a USB adaptor to make iteasier on yourself. Cost: $10-$25, cardable.Power Inverter - You'll want to power your encoder in your car, and for thatyou'll need a power inverter. Sure, the MSR206 is 12v and you could make anadaptor, but where are you going to find the strange connector it uses? You'llprobably use the power adaptor for other things anyway. For an encoder or laptopa small one will do, say 75-100 watts. Cost: $25-$55, cardable.Credit Card to encode onto - You'll need something to put those dumps on, andit's not a blank white card. You'll need to get a card from somewhere. I havefound a great way to handle this, see below. Cost: $0-$25Dumps - Duh! You'll need these! There are a few vendors on CarderPlanet, see theVendors forum for a list. Most have minimum orders, and there are differenttypes you can choose. Don't worry about a minimum order; you'll make your moneyback quickly. We'll talk about types (Classic, Gold, etc) later. Cost: $200-$500to start, much more in the futureFake ID - While it is not necessary right now, you'll need one when making largepurchases. I have tried going without one and was never rejected because Ididn't have it, but it will make things much more smooth. If you have never madeone before, don't start now. They are easy once you get enough practice, but youdon't want to be using a really bad one for this. Buy one from a vendor onCarderPlanet. More later. Cost: $5 plus equipment and time to make yourself,$75-$150 to buy.These are the things I suggest you have when starting. While you can go withouta laptop, power inverter, and fake ID if you are very short on funds, I suggestyou save up and start correctly. Once you start and get the hang of it, here area few things I suggest you get while out on a mission:Anon cell phone - Use to check dumps with phone merchant.Extra wallet - Keep the fake stuff and your real stuff separate.Case for laptop/encoder - I suggest using a briefcase to carry them. All youhave to do is pop it open, hook a few cables up, and go. You won't have to digin a bag to pull everything out.Where can I get a card to use?21So, you want to know where you can get a credit card to use for encoding. Don'tuse a stolen card!! I cannot say that enough. At some time the card will gettyped in or phoned in, and it will come back as stolen. Do not use your owncard, or they will have your name and info. If you were thinking of using yourown card stop reading this right now, close your web browser, and get back to areal job. You are not cut out for this and you WILL get caught. Now, back towhere you CAN get a card. There are a few options. I like prepaid cards.Depending on where you live, you can get prepaid credit cards out of a machine,at a mall, or at a convenience store. Simon Malls (www.simon.com) have giftcards that are prepaid Visa cards. There are many banks that have them now too.If you can't find a place to buy one in person, you can get a drop and orderone. Try www.mymccard.com, www.storedvalue.aaa.com, or some other similarproduct. If you have to order one that will have a name printed on it, make sureit's the same as your ID. Do not order one to your house; do not use your owncard to order it, etc. If you were thinking of doing that quit now before youget caught. I also like to have two cards with me, in case the one I'm usinggets declined. That way I can just say ""Let me try my other card"" and hand themthat one, instead of saying, ""Oh, I'll have to come back later"".Kinds of dumpsSo, what kind of dump should you use? It all depends on what you will be buying.If you plan on buying a lot of lower priced things (less than $500), go withClassic. They are the cheapest, but have the lowest limits. You can eat througha list of classic cards very quickly. If you plan on making larger purchases gowith gold, platinum, or signature. I stick to Visa/Mastercard. Many storesrequire the CVN of an Amex card (number printed on front), and it will lookstrange when the computer says you used an Amex and you're holding aVisa/Mastercard.Track 2 or 1 and 2?Again, this depends on where you will be using it. Most places use both tracks.See list below for places that use only track 2. Remember, stores are alwaysupdating their systems so this could change at any time. I suggest always usingboth, although sometimes you can get very good deals on dumps with only track 2.I'm ready, now what?So you have everything you need, or do you? How about software for your encoder?I use TheJerm's MSR206 program. You can download it athttp://www.thejerm.0catch.com/. It's easy and it works great.Now, before you encode your card you have to change the name. Put the name on itfrom your fake ID. If you look at the dump you'll see something like this:B41111111111111111111^SMITH/JOHN^03071010000000000000000000041111111111111111111=0307101000000000000000000000It's not hard to figure out where the name goes. The numbers right after thename in track one and right after the = in track two is the exp date in YYMMformat. This card would expire July 2003. The rest is the bank data, which wewon't get into here.So, change the name and encode. Now you're physically ready. Are you mentallyready?Prepare your mindYou ARE the person on your ID. This is YOUR credit card. You are buyingsomething you saved for. It is YOUR money you are spending.22These are things you should be thinking. The more you believe this the easier itwill be. If anyone ever questions you react like they are crazy.What do you mean? This is my card! Do you want to see my ID? I've been saving along time for this! Fine, I'll spend my money at another store!Always think about any possible situation. You will have cards declinedfrequently. I like to make the nice person at the register think it may bedeclined before I even use it. I'll say something like ""Ohhh, I didn't think itwas that much. I hope I have enough left to buy it!"" They will expect it to bedeclined and think nothing of it if it is. If it goes through they will smileand laugh. Sometimes I won't say anything beforehand. If it gets declined I'llmake up some excuse like ""I must be over my daily limit"" or ""My payment must nothave gone through."" Always think about what to say before you have to say it.Another thing to remember: DON'T PANIC! DON'T PANIC! DON'T PANIC! Even whenthings seem to be going wrong keep your cool. Cashiers always think there issomething wrong with the system, or that there is a problem with the bank, etc.As long as the card you have encoded the dump onto isn't stolen you won't haveany problems. Even when the computer tells them to pick the card up cashiersnever do it. Just say you'll take the card and call the bank and work it out.They will hand it right back to you._________________Posted: Fri Jul 25, 2003 12:54 am Post subject: Continued...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shop shop shop!Now go shopping! Start small and work your way up. I almost always go to agrocery store first; just to make sure the dump is working 100%. This is reallyunnecessary, but you have to eat anyway. Almost all grocery stores have selfswipecard readers that will help you get comfortable. Make sure you sign thename on the card and not your real name! I would suggest that you don't go togas stations. While it seems like an easy way to check the card and everyonealways needs gas, there are always tons of cameras there. The chances of themlinking the card to you and to your car are very low, but there is a chance.Spend the $20 and just make it back at the next store you go to! ALWAYS MAKESURE TO PARK FAR AWAY FROM ANY CAMERAS! You don't want your plates caught on thesecurity camera! Some people put fake plates on their car. Better to be safethan sorry!Where should I shop?This all depends on where you live what you want to buy. Always scout out a newstore before shopping. Why? Because there is one thing that can catch you: thelast 4 digits of the card. Some stores will swipe your card and then type in thelast 4 digits embossed on the front of the real card. If they don't match thenthere is a problem. It's easy enough to spot. Watch the cashier swipe a card. Ifthey look at it and then type stuff in, they are probably doing what I justdescribed. So, which stores check and which don't? Here's a list of stores Ihave found that do and do not check. This is a brief list off of the top of myhead, I will try to improve it frequently. Always scout them out before you gothere, since stores change their policies frequently.Stores that DO NOT type them in:23Abercrombie & FitchAeropostaleAlmost every clothing store*American EagleBarnes and NobleBose Factory Store/ShowroomBurlington Coat FactoryEddie BauerEvery gas station (pay at pump)*Every grocery store I have ever been to (many self swipe)Foot LockerFYEGapHome Depot (self swipe)JCPennyKauffman'sKmart (self swipe)Lowe's (self swipe)Office DepotOld NavySearsSpencer GiftsStaples*Target (self swipe, sometimes check sig)Toy WorksToys R UsWalden BooksWalmart (self swipe but most check sig)Restaurants:Applebee'sOlive GardenPizza HutMany other large chains*There is only one clothing store I have gone to that typed them in. It was anoutlet store, but I do not remember the name. It has been reported that in someareas Staples types them in. Some gas stations ask for your billing zip code.Stores that DO type them in (AVOID!):Circuit CityBest BuyCompUSAOfficeMaxRemember, always scout out the store before shopping.DO NOT SH** WHERE YOU LIVE! Don't shop at home, especially if you live in asmall town. If you're in a city it may be alright, just don't go to the placesfrequently shop with your own card or money. Some people say you should never goto the same place twice. I say this is BS. I have been to some places 50 timeswithout any problems. The store don't really care, they get to keep the money.Most of the time the stores don't even find out about it. Just make sure you area typical customer that doesn't stick out. Wear plain, normal clothing, Smile,be polite, and you should have no problems. You want to be able to go to the24same place a few times a week without being recognized. Only then are you trulya successful confidence man.What now?So now you know how to buy things. The best way to make money is to sell itemson Ebay that are in high demand. You can do your own research into this.Another OptionAnother option that was not covered here is buying or making fake cards. Thereare a few vendors on CarderPlanet that sell them, but making them is a wholeother topic. This may be a safer route for you to explore. You would not need tobuy any special equipment, but if a card goes bad before you use it you'reusually stuck (some vendors replace them).ConclusionThis should have given you an overview of how to carry out one of the mostprofitable and least dangerous methods of carding. You can easily live for free,have a steady income, and have fun.I am always trying to improve everything about myself, including this document. Checkbac
 to http://forum.carderplanet.net frequently for updates.This post was provided as a tutorial and had numerous postclarifying details of the scam as replies to the original post.This scheme should be considered when conducting a search of aknown carder. It is likely the credit card in his/her possessionmay be coded with the card number of a dump rather than the numberembossed on the front of the card.Merchant Account - One of the more popular schemes is MerchantAccount fraud. In this scheme, the hacker steals the credit carddatabase of one company and the merchant account of a second. Thecarder charges an amount on each card to the merchant account.Once the charges have cleared, approximately one hour later, thecarder issues a refund from the merchant account for the totalamount charged on the cards to the hacker controlled debit cardaccount overseas. A âdropâ is then used to retrieve the stolenmoney from the ATM using the hackersâ debit card and the money isforwarded via Western Union, Money Gram or Webmoney to the hacker.Often times the money is bounced through several bankaccounts before reaching the hacker/carder or the hacker/carderwill forego the use of a drop and pick up the money themselves.The victim is not aware of the charges and the refund until theirmerchant account is reconciled, usually at the end of the month.When the card members notice the unauthorized charges on theircards, they request the charges be canceled. This results in a25charge back to the merchant for the cost of the charge as well asa fine for bad charges.Western Union/Money Gram/Egold - This scheme is similar tofraudulent purchases however, the purchase is credits, which canbe translated into cash or traded for goods. Basically thehacker/carder uses the stolen credit card as collateral for onlinemonetary units such as money orders, Egold dollars or Webmoneydollars. The use of these monetary mediums is expensive in termsof fees and percentages but, since the money is stolen in thefirst place, hackers/carders do not complain about the charges.A hacker/carder can use these online dollars to purchasemoney orders at Western Union and have the money orders forwardedto companies to pay for goods and services. A notable purchasethrough money orders is the monthly payment for maintenance ofwebsites associated with hacking or carding.Bank Attacks - Bank account information can be used for openingescrow accounts, online brokerage accounts (i.e., E*trade, Datekor Ameritrade) or initiating wire transfers. Currently, mostbanks with online presence do not allow wire transfers online forthe regular customer. However, brokerage accounts and corporateaccounts issue credit cards and do allow online wire transferrequests. These accounts often have a significant credit limit orbank balance. These are the targets of the truly financiallymotivated hackers and their organized crime backers.In order to cause a wire transfer to travel overseas, thehackers will have to compromise the SWIFT transfer system. It hasbeen reported online, several hackers have found a way tocompromise the system but no reported cases have been found.For wire transfers in the United States, the AutomatedClearinghouse (ACH) network is used. A hacker who has researchedthe ACH system could cause an ACH re-route to occur thus, havingmoney deposited into a hacker controlled bank account which couldbe access online or through International ATM machines.Most companies allow and encourage the use of direct depositfor paychecks and accounts receivable transactions.These transactions utilize the ACH network. If the company usesan outside payroll company or accounting firm they very likely usean outside company to handle all ACH transfers. These ACHtransfer companies are the targets for hackers. If a hacker cangain access to an ACH processing company, they can change thedatabase to reflect a new bank account for a client. This will26cause all transfers normally sent to the victimâs bank account tobe re-routed to the new bank account controlled by thehacker/carder. If the new account is a corporate account, thebank has 72 hours to clear the transaction. After 72 hours, anydiscrepancies are the responsibility of the bank. In essence, are-route of an ACH transfer for one week could bankrupt a company.Identity Theft - When a hacker/carder steals personal data fromany location, this information can be used to create fake idâs,known as novelty idâs to hackers, credit cards, bank accounts,loans and numerous other fraudulent media. If a hacker obtains aSocial Security Number (SSN), they can use that information toapply for credit cards online in the real name of the SSN holder.They can also open bank accounts online at sites such asNetBank.com. These bank accounts will have credit cards or debitcharges associated with them which can be sent via a re-mailer,trans-shipper or U.S. based associate to the hacker/carderâslocation.A notable trend has been the use of stolen credit cards tobuy access to information sites such as ConsumerInfo, ChoicePointor Lexus/Nexus. From these sites the hackers/carders can identifyaddresses and telephone numbers for cardholders whose cards werestolen but the full cardholder information was not obtained.These sites and the information provided by them have enabledhackers/carders to commit identity theft at will.Fake Sites - Similar to the fake store sites detailed above,hackers/carder will create fake auction, escrow and bank sites.As stated above the three possibilities for these shops are: theproduct is not shipped and the card is not charged, the product isnot shipped and the card is charged or the product is shipped andthe card is charged.If the product is not shipped and the card is not charged,the hacker is simply collecting cards to use later. Often timesthe customer will forget about the purchase or will not worryabout the lack of receipt because their card was never charged.If the product is not shipped and the card is charged, thehacker was just stealing the money and will have to re-establishthe fake site under a different name after approximately 6 weeks.The customer will often complain in these cases resulting in achargeback to the fake sites merchant account. When thechargeback is not paid, the merchant account will be shut down andthe hacker will start afresh.27If the product is sent and the card is charged, then thehackers have coupled their schemes. Meaning they are using one ofthe other schemes to obtain products to then sell on their site.The stolen goods will be shipped to the unsuspecting customer perthe deal, but the hacker/carder will now have the customerâscredit card. If the hacker/carder is patient and waits three tosix months before making a charge, it will be nearly impossiblefor the customer to determine from which site the card was stolen.The added bonus is, if the original retailer of the re-sold goodsreported the serial numbers of the equipment as stolen, when thenew customer tries to register the equipment, it will red-flag thecustomer. By the time the transactions are sorted out, thehackers/carders and their site will be long gone with the moneyfrom the sale of stolen merchandise.Extortion â When all other methods have been exhausted, many ofwhich have been successful, hackers and carders will turn to basicextortion to obtain money. The most common extortion is phrasedsimilar to the following:âHello, I have found holes in your system, for $2000 dollarsI will fix the holes and make sure no other hackers gain access toyour system. I would hate to have to tell your customers aboutyou lack of security.âThis threat usually comes in the form of an email or fax. Ifthe victim does not respond, a second email and/or will be sentstating if the victim does not pay, the extortionist will beforced to post the stolen information on the Internet.The interesting thing about extortion is often two or moremembers of the group responsible for the intrusion and theft willtry to extort the same company independently. This results inconfusion for the victim and the extortionist.DDOS â Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are not oftenconsidered part of profit making but recent trends show the use ofDDOS attacks are being used in association with extortion. Oncehackers have created a BotNet through the use of tainted(files/programs containing a virus/worm payload as well as IRCclient with instruction to call home periodically) viruses, filesharing downloads (warez, mp3s, etc.) or straight hacking, DDOSattacks will be launched knocking particular sites offline fordays at a time. (Those sites on the same network as the targetedsite will suffer a loss of service as well making them collateraldamage and future extortion victims.) Victims will often pay28extortionists the requested sum rather than suffer the loss ofbusiness. Some enterprising individuals, known as botmasters, whohave successfully build large botnets, will hire themselves out.They are in essence cyber mercenaries willing to DDOS any and allsites if the price is right.Collecting the MoneyOnce all the fraud is committed and the profits have beenreaped, the hackers and carders need to convert the money to cash.The most common request is to have the money wired via WesternUnion (WU). For a small percent of the profit, WU clerks inEastern Europe will look the other way if the recipientsâ Id doesnot match the name of the individual retrieving the cash. If apassphrase is used, there is no need for an Id. Finally, WUtransfers can be used to fund ATM cards, which then require noIdâs and no personal contact to obtain the funds.All of the schemes allow the hackers and carders to convertthe money into electronic credit that must be sent to a bankaccount or e-currency repository. These repositories can be assimple as an online bank account such as NetBank and INGDirect ornormal bank accounts at banks that have less stringent bankingrequirements, i.e., off shore banks in Latvia, the Republic ofNauru or Cyprus.The problem with these methods is the paper trail associatedwith keeping money in a bank.With the advent of e-currency/online escrow accounts, camethe advent of e-currency ATM cards, also known as pre-paidcredit/debit cards. These cards can be purchased for a small feeand funded using any of the e-currencies currently availableincluding, EVOCash, Egold, LogixPay, eBullion, GoldMoney, Pecunixand NetPay. The cards are in essence pre-paid ATM cards that arefunded by sending money to the particular e-currency broker. Thecash is then withdrawn at any ATM that accepts the respective ATMcards.Providers of prepaid Debit cards or e-Currency ATM cardsinclude, SwiftPay, WMcards, Ecount, Wired Plastic, Green Card,Citi Cash Card, Eufora, as well cards issued by the e-currencycompanies and hundreds of others.Many enterprising subjects have set themselves up asmiddleman for the carders. These individuals set up online29businesses that handle the money-laundering and stolen propertysales (âconsignment shopsâ) aspects of the schemes for thecarders. The sites will offer bank accounts, debit cards and dropaddresses to the carders in exchange for a fee. The carders willthen have the profits from extortions, Paypal fraud, Auction fraudor any of the other schemes deposited into the account or shippedto the address. However, no real bank account will be set up forthe carders. The site owner will open one bank account and usingan Excel type spreadsheet, assign accounts to each of his clients.When money is deposited into the bank account of the site owner, aspecial denotation will be required indicating into which clientaccount the money is to be deposited. This denotation will meannothing to the legitimate bank at which the site ownerâs accountresides. The site owner will deduct his percentage and denote theremaining amount on his spreadsheet as belonging to the specifiedclient. The client can then have this money transferred to a bankaccount, a pre-paid debit card or use the money to purchase ecurrency.Basically, the site owner has created their own bankwithout the regulations or oversight of a legitimate bank.ConclusionAn organized use of the above detailed schemes could resultin the de-stabilization of the banks and the credit card industrybeing victimized. These schemes have already been attributed tothe collapse of several businesses and were utilized to finance atleast one terrorist attack (the Bali bombing). At a minimum theloss, which exceeds $10 billion a year in fraud and damage tocomputer networks, can being blamed for the rise of purchaseprices to consumers and the rise of interest rates on creditcards.International financially motivated hackers are talented,educated and willing to do anything for money. They do not fearlaw enforcement because they think they cannot be caught. They dofear the FBI but only if they come to the United States. They areoverseas therefore they are invincible. However, plans are beingmade to work with the respective law enforcement agency in each ofthe countries where hackers and carders have been identified. Theintention of these cooperative efforts is to provide lawenforcement with the proper training to catch the hackers andcarders, to arrange their prosecution either in their homecountries or in the U.S. and to obtain copies of their computerhard drives for use against additional targets.This cooperation has already worked in Belarus, England,Canada and has been requested by Turkey, Ukraine and Russia.30Finally, these hackers/carders offer up information regardinghacking and carding freely online. Thus far, all indications arethe schemes are being used by loosely connected groups who joinforce for one or two jobs and then part ways. Given theavailability of the information and the changing climate of theworld, in the near future, these attacks/schemes will be operatedby highly organized groups with various political agendas. Onlinechatter has begun regarding âbig hitsâ such as attacking variouscountriesâ central banks, shutting down systems and bilking largecorporations for millions of dollars. All indications are thistype of crime will continue unfettered if law enforcement does notincrease our knowledge base and cooperate internationally.Though we will never stop this type of crime, byunderstanding what they are doing and how they are profiting, wemay be able to limit the criminalâs effectiveness while dissuadingothers from trying to hack and card in the first place.

Hello Folks,Im planning to buy a hacked paypal account (cashout in btc wallet). Only now there is rising a question how stay save when you buy products are change it in cash with the bitcoins form a hacked account.For example i will buy a phone form one of the vendors and the phone will be shipped to my home address. Then will know the vendor my address. if it happen that the vendor will caught by the police and this guy has still my address in his mail account so the police also will come to my home (example). Is there a possibility that the police can track the bitcoins and that they will see that the bitcoins come from a cashout form a stolen paypal account? The second example i get the cashout from the paypal account in my wallet and i will change the bitcoins for real money for example with bank transfer again my personal date will be known by this people. how save is this to do.

I understand that BlackBank supposedly has a tumbler on site, however the withdraw statements clearly show where I withdrew my coins to, and this defeats the purpose of a tumbler. If the site is compromised by LE, these ""Bank Statments"" pose a HUGE threat and give LE a lot of useful information they can use to try to track down vendors.

If the site is compromised by LE, these ""Bank Statments"" pose a HUGE threat and give LE a lot of useful information they can use to try to track down vendors.I see two possible scenarios:LE gets to your personal computer. In this case your 2FA should protect you and your account history.LE gets control of the server. In this scenario I think you're transaction history is theirs whether it's available for you to see or not. I'm not sure if it's possible to run a market without keeping this information in the ledger for at least some amount of time. So regardless if it's available for you to see, it's stored somewhere I'm guessing.It's nice to see you TH. I know you'll keep the standards up on the candy game around here.

If the site is compromised by LE, these ""Bank Statments"" pose a HUGE threat and give LE a lot of useful information they can use to try to track down vendors.I see two possible scenarios:LE gets to your personal computer. In this case your 2FA should protect you and your account history.LE gets control of the server. In this scenario I think you're transaction history is theirs whether it's available for you to see or not. I'm not sure if it's possible to run a market without keeping this information in the ledger for at least some amount of time. So regardless if it's available for you to see, it's stored somewhere I'm guessing.It's nice to see you TH. I know you'll keep the standards up on the candy game around here.The withdraws can easily be wiped from the server permanently, which is what should be done. My concern is more about the amount they see you withdrew around the time you moved it. it wont paint any guilty picture, but it could be a basis to try and find you. Adding the address to the equations leads them even further in an investigation.It would make my job more difficult in that i would have to move different amounts at different times to not leave a trail for myself. Id rather just not give them the info in the first place.  What is the benefit to seeing your withdraw statements??? In my EXPERIENCE, not just opinion, It has never given me a benefit.  All the sites ive been on didnt show this information, and ive never needed it. (I know SR had this, but i never vended on any SR site)

Even if it's stated that this information is wiped, what assurance do you have? You should operate as if this information is stored forever. It's also arguable that not showing it to you provides you a false sense of security leading you into unsafe practices.

Yes dimwit - withdraw to a tumbler not straight to your trap house, TrapHouse. You must have too much of those noxious cut agent fumes circulating in that house of yours, TrapHouse.Go do a rail of that TrapHouse guaranteed - better than any other yayo on any darkmarket, better than any vendor, purest, pantheonic, can I get an AMEN, coCAInneee of yours brothah man and chill out.

Layer up your tumbler services, and BitcoinFog most certainly has good options to break up amounts into 20 seperate deposits to the same or different address'. For example, send from BB to BitBlender, or Helix or any other trusted tumbler. Then divide the bitcoin into as many deposits between up to the 5 multiple address' allowed in your Fog account. Then use Fog settings to withdraw the coins split into a maximum of 20 seperate deposits into your final ""clean address"" or two. Of course this example is moving the coins all at once from the Fog when you could just schedule a couple different withdraws. Seems this practice would make it impossible to track the coins to you. We double/triple tumble only when we must move thousands at once, but the regular couple of hundreds we usually have in escrow we just cycle between different tumblers, one at time.

This is a guide to storing bitcoins or any other data. I'm going to use Tails is my scenario because there's not many people that can develop a system as secure on their own, and these instructions will work for almost every linux distro. You will also need an sdcard or a usb stick.This method is using LVM and cryptsetup to create two partitions on one disk. One partition will be for an encrypted key to unlock an encrypted space on the second partition. Hopefully by utilizing multiple layers of encryption with different cipher algos and multiple unique/robust passwords (35+ characters, random) combined with added iterations we should be safe against most current attacks. This is a somewhat paranoid/up against a nation state setup.If you like this guide please let me know. I'm considering to open a shop with cheap guides like this. ftp Bitcoin Use/Storage Case For Extreme SecuritySo we'll begin by booting to Tails 1.3.2 with a sudo password set in the beginning via the 'More options' button.

It's not just ink and printing. You'll need a specific type of printer. I once made ID's, long ago when the tech wasn't there.Now witth the advances, it's gonna be a rather expensive endeavor.

Black Bank Market Forums,psyclerdude,730,2014-11-12T02:20:50,Instore Carding Tutorial,How-To,"
Instore Carding TutorialEverything you wanted to know about instore carding Introduction: So youre interested in trying out instore carding? Instore carding is one of the fastest ways to get money. But you will need to keep your head on straight for this. As you should with every operation you go out to do. This tutorial will tell you the ins and outs of instore carding. Feel free to distrobute this as much as you want. For the beginners: Youre obviously reading this because you either A. Want to learn how to instore card or B. Want to see if you can find anything you are not aware of. For people who chose A. You should have atleast some prior knowledge of credit cards before you try instoring. If you do not that is ok too, just keep reading the tutorial and by the end of it you should be fine. The most important thing about instore carding is how you *Take the part* of the identity youre *Playinig* as. If youre going into a store looking to come out with $3-5k worth of electronics dressed in your normal apparel and being nervous, think again. You need to dress up and act like a person who would look like they could buy these items any day of the week. The first time youre going to be nervous ofcourse, its natural to be nervous the first few times. But with time and past experiences to look back on, it just gets easier as you go on. Dressing the part: This should come natural to most people out there. To buy something expensive you need to make it look like you can buy these items along with acting like you can (below). For your first operation i suggest should include you going into any of the clothing stores listed below and buy a decent amount of quality clothes. I cannot stress enough how quality plays a part in dressing up. Buying a sweater in walmart and a sweater in banana republic could determine the difference between getting out with your goods or running out of the store. Along with clothing you might want to buy some jewelry or a very high priced watch. If a cashier suspects something is up, seeing some classy jewelry or a watch could also help reduce the suspicion. Clothing stores are usually never uptight with purchases of clothing so that is why I suggest going there first to get some quality clothes. You can be dressed as you want in there and it wont matter. When you buy the new clothes, put them on in a restroom and then continue your activities on a higher priced basis. Acting the part: This area will come hard for some but easier for others. Prepare yourself before you go in with things you might say. If youre going into a store to buy smaller items ($800 and below) , this usually not hard to accomplish. But for larger items you should act as if you can afford these items at any time of day. Acting stuck up in a sense can accomplish this. Other than that, dressing the part is the other area that helps you present yourself as a person of wealth. Beginning: Before you go out there and start instoring you will need the following items. Card reader/writer - Youre going to have to (in most cases) need a card reader/writer to write new dumps on your cards. Especially if you want to re encode your cards and go out. The only case where you would not need this is if you were buying plastic from a vendor who offers to encode the dumps for you. For a reader/writer I highly recommend the MSR-206. It is the most popular encoder out there. You can buy them from Price: $200 $640 Computer/Laptop (Preferred) - To be able to encode your dumps (later on) you will first need a computer to hook your card encoder up to. Using a desktop is fine but if you come into any problems with your dumps which is going to happen, you will have no way to re encode your plastic. You will have to drive home and re encode there. But if you have a laptop, you can bring your MSR with you and just hook it up and re encode while youre in your car. Doing this will save you gas, and time. Price: $600 to $2400 Power Inverter - This is a very handy tool that youre going to need for this and you will probably find yourself using for all other types of things. The MSR requires a power source so buy or card one of these. If your laptop battery gets low aswell which will sometimes happen just hook it up aswell. I found a very good one at BestBuy for $80. It covers up to 800 watts (400 watts each plug). Price: $80 Plastic - I have seen all sorts of ways to obtain plastic. From stealing others and using those to buying them from a vendor. You DO NOT want to steal anyones credit cards and start using those. And you do not want to re encode your own credit cards. Im sure it makes sense to do so but over time if you start using your own credit card, the credit card companys are going to see the name being used and will surely contact you about these occurances. The best bet is to buy plastic from a vendor. Think about this too. When buying plastic, get atleast 2 cards with the same name as your novelty. It will save money on new novelties and give you a higher chance of walking out with your merchandise. Dumps - The most important item of this whole operation. What would you do without dumps? Nothing thats what. Now depending on what youre planning on getting out for your first op will determine on how much you will need to spend on dumps. I would not worry about spending for now. As soon as your op is over you will see that you have well made your money back from this. Wallet - Some people may think that putting the plastic and novelty in your own wallet is not a bad idea. But the truth is that it is probably one of the biggest problems that could arise if anything was to happen. Keeping your false information and your real information seperate is a necessity. If you have any sort of personal contact information on you when carding I would suggest dropping it off in your car. Optional Items - Fake ID - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED but is not always needed. Most of the time for large purchases cashiers will ask for an identification that matches the plastic. There are numerous vendors out there who provide a novelty service that will fit your needs. Getting a state that is semi close to you is ideal in this situation. Anonymous Phone - This is optional to have, I have used dumps from seller that checks the dumps before sending so that all are valid. His dumps work 8/10 times on average. So if one card does not work I simply hand them another card with an excuse as to why that card was not working. If youre going through any other vendor you should buy a tracfone and find a phone merchant that will verify your dumps before you go into a store. When using a phone merchant there are two ways of authorizing a card. Some people think that charging a $1 or $1.50 on the card will not kill the card as many businesses use a $1 or $1.50 charge as a pre-authorization to check and see if the card is valid. Others prefer charging a random higher amount to make it look like a legit purchase. Either way, its up to you how would want to check it. Serial to USB Converter - Smaller laptops may not come with a serial port to connect your encoder to. If this is the case you will need to buy one of these. Price: $15-$25 Newskin Bandaid Liquid - You might be asking yourself ""What would I do with this?"". Well, if you really want to be protective you can put some newskin on your finger tips so no traces of fingerprints will appear on the plastic if any misfortune was to happen. Planning: Planning out what youre going to buy before you buy it would be a nice thing to do. It saves you time thinking of what you need or might need. Also think about this. If youre main goal is to get a hefty sum of money, you should checkout ebay to see what sells for a high percentage. Usually gift cards to popular stores get high amounts back because they are just like cash. But just double check ebay. If youre going to do an instore op for your own personal pleasure then you really dont need to make a list because you should already know what you want to get. Or you can look around in the store and choose what you want. Taking care of business: Before hand I always like going to the bathroom. It makes the carding situation a bit more easier if you get nervous. JediMasterC brought this on aswell. You do not want to get caught and be remembered as the kid who shit his pants. That is if you do get caught which odds are you wont if you follow these instructions. Destination Safety: Choosing a location to instore is not very hard. The internet has a vast amount of websites that have store locators. So find your subject mall or store and do a search to see whats around you. Here is a very important rule to follow by. Do not do anything where you live. Or in a more common way of putting it. Dont shit where you live. Find a store thats atleast a good half hour drive away from you and is atleast two cities over. Some people choose to use fake license plates when entering your destination for carding just to add that extra level of security on in case a camera catches the car that drives away. This is ofcourse optional, but it doesnt hurt to put more safety on. Just dont speed away or anything that could get you pulled over. Parking - When parking your car, make sure you park for out so no camera will catch your license plate. It will be worth the extra walk when youre walking out with your merchandise. Ready: So now you have everything you need to get started. Youre prepared for the best and the worst situations to come. The first time you go out you should expect some nervousness to come even before entering one of the stores listed below. The most important thing to do is to stay calm and act natural. The more suspicious you act, the more the cashier is going to suspect something is up. I do not recommend taking any drug or alcohol to calm yourself down. You need to look calm and natural while being alert to your atmosphere at the same time. [color=blackImportant anatomy of a dump: There is a more detailed version of this on CP. But for now, you will only need to know this information to start. B41111111111111111111^LASTNAME/FIRSTNAME^060910100 000000000000000000 41111111111111111111=0609101000000000000000000000 B - Identifies to the POS system that your card is a bank card 4111111111111111 - Credit Card Number Lastname - Lastname of cardholder / - Seperater Firstname - Firstname of cardholder 06 - Experation Year 09 - Experation Month 101 & Beyond - Bank data Now some vendors will only sell the second track. So that leaves you with trying to figure out how to write track1. Most stores do not check track1 so it is not the most important thing. But to be safe I always include track1. Here is an example of what you will need to do. It is very easy. 4111111111111111=060910100000000000000 If you havent noticed, track2 in most cases is just like track1. To begin making track1, add a B that will indeicate its a Bank card. B4111111111111111=060910100000000000000 Then, youre going to want to change the = to a ^lastname/firstname^ . B4111111111111111^LASTNAME/FIRSTNAME^0609101000000 00000000 And finally, youre going to add six zeros at the end of the dump. B4111111111111111^LASTNAME/FIRSTNAME^0609101000000 00000000000000 And thats your dump. Like I said its not hard to create track1 from only having track2. Software to encode the dumps - I recommend TheJerms software. It is very self explanitory. Types of dumps: People ask me all the time about using generated dumps and if theyre good. I would not use generated dumps. Most of the time they will only work correctly with a certain Bin. And there is a 15% less success rate than using other types of dumps. You might as well use quality dumps in your locations you choose so people will not remember you instead of having errors come up and your face gets noticed more easily. The best quality dump you will probably find are skimmed dumps. Skimmed dumps mean that the actual card was swiped onto a portable Mag Stripe reader. Therefore, using these you know you will have all of the correct information for track1 and track2. Hacked dumps are usually taken from databases by you guessed it, hackers. The quality on these are the normal quality thats out there. Dump types and limits: I will only discuss so far visa, discover dump limits and a word on amex dumps as I have not encounted any use with mastercard dumps. Visa Classic - These types of dumps are usually the cheapest to buy from a vendor. I have heard that on average you can get $500 on these types of dumps. But I have been pulled atleast $800 on them. Visa classics have a balance limit of $500 to $3,500. Although the most I have been able to get off of a single classic is $2,600 before an error occurs. Visa Gold - One step above the classic, These limits start at $3,500 and can double as the cardholder gains good credit. With these you can make higher amounts of purchases. Visa Platinum - Visa platinum dumps are for the larger purchases mainly. On a good day you can pull off anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000 . Visa Signature & Business - Signatues are said to have no limits. So for us that means these have the highest limits available. People have said to have gotten anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 off of these types of dumps. Discover - I have not used these that much in my past but from what I gathered you can get anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 on these in one purchase. Using these dumps for multiple purchases will most likely kill the dump before you get past either of those limits. Almost all discover cards begin with a balance of $10,000. Amex - I have not used these dumps. The reason to that is that you need the correct CVN to complete the transaction. It is not embossed, but printed onto the plastic. So you cannot re encode amex dumps. If the CVN is not correct when entered, you will automatically get a call for authorization. How long dumps last: This question no one can answer. You might be able to make a good prediction of how long they will last if you think of time and the dump type. For instance. If you have a classic dump, its 11:30 AM and you make a variety of small (Under $20) purchases. Odds are youre going to get that card to last a lot longer than a classic dump thats doing $300 purchases at 7:30 PM. Think of the cardholders work hours. They will usually be 9 AM to 5 PM. That is when their card is idle so to speak. Advanced dump purchasing: By now, if you have been reading about dumps. You might know that by purchasing dumps from banks that are closer to your area, that there is a higher success rate on most purchases. Only some vendors will offer to let you buy by a certain Bin (first six digits of the cc). The Bin determines what bank corresponds with the card. To find local Bins, go to http://www.hermesbank.net/interchange/ and search for a any bank that has a lot of locations in your area. You can also search for the state name and see what that comes up with. Choosing your cashier: This is probably one of the more fun things to do while instoring. Usually 90% of the time, Minorities and Younger Girls make the best choice for cashing out. Minorities include, Blacks, Mexicans, and Asians if you were wonderings. The reason you want to choose these types for your cashiers are because they are usually the easiest to manipulate. In some cases you are going to have to use a normal person to cashout. But try not to make it a habbit. Interactions with the cashier: In order to safely get your items out of the store successfully, you will need to know how to interact with the cashier. To in a sense manipulate them. When you bring your stuff up to the cashier act normal. If it is a large amount they might say something nice to you mentioning the amount of merchandise you are buying. Just play with it and make them feel good aswell. If you make the cashier not feel comfortable they will think something is up if any error happens. Which will sometimes if you are planning on doing a lot of instore. Errors and Excuses: As I was saying above, there are going to be errors now and then. Now most are very easy to talk your way out of. But in some cases youre going to need to know when you try and grab your novelty and card and just run. That will most likely not happen if youre only doing this a few times but for people who are planning to do this more often
it is most likely going to happen atleast once. I have listed below a few common errors and how to handle them. Optional Pre-Excuse - JediMasterC brought this excuse method to a lot of peoples attention and it is a very good idea in most cases. Making the cashier already think that the transaction will not go through so they are not surprised by the error, which makes handling the situation much easier. Saying something as easy as *I hope I have enough to cover this* or anything around those terms is good. Declined - Once you spend and spend on a good dump there has to be an ending point. Usually with dumps that will not die this is the final step to completing it. Hopefully you will have another card on you to hand the cashier. If you don't thats fine too. If you have another card - Oh, I thought that was going to happen. Here try my other card. If you do not have another card - I will be right back. I'm going to go get my check book / go to the ATM. Call For Authorization - This one can be tricky if you do not have the right cashier. This is something you DO NOT want the cashier to do. A call for authorization is basically the store calling the bank or the stores authorization center in order to confirm that it is the actual cardholder making the purchase. If this happens just stay calm. If you have another card - I don't have that much time, Ill call the bank later. Try my other card. If you do not have another card - I don't have that much time for this Ill call my bank and come back tomorrow. If they persist on making the call, put your hand out as if they were going to give you your plastic back. Doing this tends to put some stress on the cashier as to whether or not give the card back to you. They usually will put the card back in your hands. Do Not Honor - This will happen every now and then and is probably the easiest to overcome. The cashiers will sometimes just ask you if you have another card. If you have another card - Hand them the card and say you'll call the bank about that one. If you do not have another card - Oh, I will call my bank about that tomorrow (then leave) Those are the most common problems you are going to find. Of course there are more error codes. There are about 50 of them. But by the time you manage to talk yourself out of these you will have enough experience to talk yourself out of the rest. Selling your items: There are a vast amount of ways for you to liquidate your items. The best way to do so is on ebay. I am not going to go into a large description because then this tutorial would change to how to sell your items or scam on ebay. You can either buy an account from a vendor or get a B&M bank account and create your own. I do not suggest using your own ebay account. A lot of people have in the past and even if a good amount havent been caught, you do not want to be that small percent that does. Storing your money: Here is another area that can be done in a lot of ways. I will tell you to not put the money in your legit bank account. If you were thinking that, you should take a minute and think again. You could store your money on an electronic bank account service such as egold, or webmoney. Or if you want more control over your money, you could keep it all in a well hidden safe. Using an electronic bank account instead has a higher security rate. As if anything was to happen to you involving LE, odds are they will not find your information for that account. Which means they would not have access to your funds because they would not know it exists. End Notes: Thank you for taking your time to read this tutorial. I hope it was worth your time! I also hope that everyone who is inspired by this reply with any words or questions they would like to say.

I get a good bit of Weed about 1lb + every month or so but my re-up times are very slow, mainly due to waiting a week for Coinbase to purchase the coins. I am looking for a quicker and secure way to purchase coins. I would buy them on CB, send to a VM wallet with SOCKS5 and VPN and then to HELIX and then to the market I wanted to order from.But CB takes ~7 days to buy the coins and only offers up to $1000 worth of coins instantly PER WEEK. I also don't like the fact that I load the cash on my account and then make multiple purchases of high amounts of BTC from Coinbase.Any suggestion for better security / faster BTC to my wallet? I really liked it back in the day of The Farmer's Market for weed, I'd send it to a cash drop for an extra small fee and buy weed that way. Without involving a bank account / prepaid card.any help would be appreciated.ICQ: 669055770 with pidgin + OTR

It is a shame but our gov is a puppet of the big money and when the big money sees that others are the competition then the lobbyist are send like the cavalry to fight for laws and changes and the gov dances.

Back to the subject i think keeping a low profile is the best way for anything the more noise the worst it could be,,are we still in a democracy?Make it hard for them and stay cool, and enjoy the rewards, no matter what drugs are part of the world like the dna, no government will ever be able to eradicate drugs. Drugs are part of the makeup, some drink alcohol cause it is legal and they dnt know how to get or experience other things and the stigma of drugs associated with illicit but if they knew the high is so much better than alcohol, then i think alcohol would loose a lot of market,.You guys dnt think that the alcohol money is not behind the fight against drugs?Big money corporations would always be behind with anything that could have the potential to take a chunk at their nest egg,,and that is what i have to say about that. lol",NA

Despite the SR bust they should realize that they are losing an option that has always served them very well in the past: following the money. With bitcoins being able to be tumbled, held in anonymous wallets and such, by anyone in any country, this part has become problematic.  They will probably procede to place orders to figure out dealer addresses though, posing as small buyers.  Still, vendors are the ones that should be mostly concerned. While the money trail is becoming more obscure, more and more countries are developing databases of fingerprints and DNA. This could compromise a vendor that packages the goods himself, even across borders.

Basically, are the feds ruthless enough to set up a vendor account, sell drugs, establish a presence, gather addresses, etc? Or are they sticking by the book 100% and not selling drugs? Those are the two options. I think it's totally plausible that they are indeed that ruthless, some of the black ops that have been run (9/11 lol) are crazy. I recall reading an article that the FBI took over one particular child porn site, and kept it running for two weeks in order to conduct more surveillance. This would be nearly the same thing.

After all the resources they put into taking down SR, the (horrifically) well played policework by the feds that culminated in the ""get DPR to hire a cop to hit another cop"" sting, the sheer, unfathomable amount of resources they have available, and all the people that must be working specifically to bring this site down, trust me, they have a lengthy, prioritized list of potential ideas to take this site down and expose the anonymous. Hopefully not any good ideas, but you can bet that the at LEAST a few governments have tasked a bunch of smart dudes with taking down BMR and Sheep.  BTCReload, Yeah exactly. I'm hesitant to speculate that any government agency got the go ahead from their bosses to sell opiates  (at least heroin) on BMR... Plus, if I were them, I wouldn't want to gather the largest profile, I would want to remain fairly low key, not saying much, just collecting information. Especially addresses and names... I am especially hesitant to think that they would sell heroin because of the success they're apparently having with Nod rolling on people... Once you arrest just ONE vendor like Nod, the consequences could be seriously terrifying. All the information gathered by the feds just running his acct for 2 weeks.... it's really scary to think about. Because they did exactly this, and unfortunately this is not the last arrest of it's kind we can expect to see, and the government knows this, I think that rather than sell heroin they will wait and pop the people selling meth, coke, AND heroin. Meanwhile, if I was them, I'd be slinging QP's of dank weed on the downlow, mad low key, offering extremely good deals on weed to other vendors (trying to track vendors in real life, getting their addresses), occasionally coming thru with outdoor weed to seem like you're a real pot dealer with real pot dealer problems... and making new throw-away accounts to give away tiny user-size quantities of free sample drugs, just to collect as many addresses as possible. That's my speculation, anyway, on just a few of things that would me sense for me to do if I was them.",NA

As far as I know there has been only one case in the netherlands where someone got busted into something possibly related to silkroad: XTC express. It is, however, not clear if that arrest was made due to the silkroad bust, or if it was something already being investigated before SR was compromised.

They will single out the ones that has made stupid mistakes like register using an email that can be traced.  Vendors are a priority and the bigger the better. So they would probably sort the vendors by size/activity and go after them with normal processes. Customers that buy in bulk for reselling will also be a target. Like previously stated. If they target you it will likely just be a matter of time before thy track you down. Trying to take down the trading sites like BR is not that easy. Even if they track it and the people behind it.

Alone the fact that you suppose buyers as scammers which FE'd to you should be enough to smell fish. evidence (not proof) for scam:- not own products, only direct resells from other sellers- feedback padding in the beginning of your bmr career- asking for FE- asking for positive feedback after goods did not arrive- always telling that you would pay for orders, too. If you would pay you would not offer the item because you cannot make money when you sell cheaper than you buy. Of course it is possible that you are legit. But very fishy smell here. I will take a closer look to your feedback now as I did before after you took my 30$ ;-) -Like i wrote above your feedback starts with feedback padding.-nbome-Blotter and Pill Sales look legit to me.-The weed feedback is weird:12$ - hope of a bigger Buisness with u when iam Received my Order! ;-)90$ - SCAM!!! 16$ - very good communication 12$ - thx ! 30$ - (was me) fe'd after request; not arrived after over 1 month; neither refund nor reship; dd007 asked for positive fb regardless; good, that it were only 30 $6$ - nice one , good weed for price . seller look like honnest We see 6 weed orders in your feedback.1. we don't know if arrived2. not arrived3. we don't know but seems to me that it did not arrive and you told him what you told me in msg to get positive feedback.4. we don't know but looks like he got his goods finally after 1 month.5. did not arrive (i know 100%)6. arrived.So we have a delivery range about 50% or what? No legit seller would keep that item online that forcefully, if it has such a high default rate. To think carefully about that weird case of scam(?): In my eyes it don't have to be a scam. It is possible that the problem is not with dd007.Weed buyers are normally not such bad people to scam around with wrong feedback to get a few dollars back, especially when there is (because of FE) no way to get the money back. And I know 100% what comes to my letterbox and what not.There have to be a reason that all the packages get lost. I think there are two options, which both should be reason enough to shut this item down. 1. dd007 is a scammer and uses his other listings for feedback and this one indian weed item to scam the shit out of people. 2. The Indians don't pack stealth what is MUCH worse than a package which never was sent. If it is not vacuumized e.g. on it's way around the world everybody can smell. But I received an not well packaged intensive smelling letter from QualityDrug from NL (!) perfectly fine. I absolutely don't know what the issue is with that indian (selfdestroying?) weed. But what I know: YOU (dd007) have to clear the facts about and assume responsibility for all the packages which not arrived, not anybody else. And it is a absolutely fail that just that item has these different policities (FE; no refund etc.)  @dd007 again:- Can you please short down your profile text to the half or less, most informations are double double.- Please don't sell items you cannot assume responsibility for.- Please offer Escrow, Refund and Reship to your customers.

These guys are not vendors, however, they probably have several accounts, some to provide support to his false accusations, others will be his hardcore scamming that he will use to get bitcoins to finance his drug purchases.  It really is a clever disguies and plan, with 1 exception, they always make the mistake of underestimating admins thoroughness.... These guys will typically change their story as the facts are revealed, until they can't anymore, then they will bring up everything else but the facts about how you didn't do this or that... Sellers can protect themselves on high dollar items  by doing what I did...Document everything for the dispute,.... Take pics of the items date & time stampledTake pics of the packaging..Take pics of the package labelTake pics of the post office receiptUse a Tracking with MOney back guarantee if possibleTake pics of the post officeTake Video of the procedure Despite me doing all this and providing it too admin, the guy actually is now saying in the dispute that he never got tracking?  Really? He changed his story 3 different times.. Then he treatened admin after I posted all the pics of everything...See I delayed the pics of everything until he locked himself into another lie...

Check the feedback but don't rely just in the number, press the + to see if the feedback is legit.    If you see like 0.0001 btc for 1g heroin, it's needless to say that is padding. 2. The scammer will always look eager to get out of escrow, or avoid it if possible. It's a thing you can't see, but all of them rush to withdraw once you release. They will make up that customers make them hold on escrow and never release, don't want to be scammed and so on; this is BS as they can dispute the escrow and give the customer 5 days to reply.Security tip:Do not release the escrow early / Do not let yourself go to email and UKash business 3.

My advice would be to figure out what sort of scammer you're dealing with: Softcore You probably won't hear of him anymore. This kind of scammer just vanishes when you figured him out.This is the most common kind of scammer you may come to find. Hardcore Thus less common, hardcore scammers are, however, dangerous. They fit in a weird mental status that twists reality and what makes them so good liars is that way before they lied to you, they already managed to lie to themselves. It's a common mental state of pickpockets, they tend to believe their victims are not being robbed but ""carrying their money"". They will never acknowledge to had scam you, instead in their view it is you who's in debt towards them due to their ""hard work"", and will swear over their mother's grave for their honesty (don't bite that, they probably already sold out their mothers anyway).If you notice you'd falling to one of these: AVOID CONTACT AT ALL COST! That people is twisted and dangerous! If you chase him he'll start to threaten you and if feels you too close to catch him may become hazardous. Remember he's living on his own twisted reality where you scammed him and not the other way around. A common sign that you're dealing with a hardcore scammer is that he will try immediately to twist reason and to rehash, by saying something like: Â«hey, you send me more X and I'll give you more YÂ».",NA

NO ONE (in numbers: 0!) should ask you to pay up front 50% of the price due to shipping or so. There is a ""release shipping escrow"" in the details of the purchase, where you can release the (guess what) shipping escrow, avoiding to pay half of the purchase price. Also, if you do not understand why a normal listing is that cheap, ask! And be precise! There are 3 kinds of those things:1. Scammer, trying to make easy money2. Someone can (or would) not use the item sold, which MUST be explained why3. Special listing to make new friends or get good feedback (which is then stated in the description, if not: see 1.)If the vendor does not respond or tries to wiggle himself out of an explanation: HANDS OFF! This way you can spot a Scammer. A normal, honest vendor is open to questions and explains all in detail (except for shipping methods or sensitive data).My two cents...",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Rempelman,17,2012-07-25T02:14:00,Re: Do NOT use your facebook/MSN/LinkedIn/whatever email with this site!,Safety,"I have been with Hushmail for more than 10 years, starting with a free account and later with a paying one. In the beginning all was well (late nineties). Hushmail had a good reputation and their site was full of glowing chestbeating how they were located in Canada and could do what they wanted (it came down to that) and was even recommended by the pgp creator (could have been someone else important with pgp too) and was used by a lot of people in the pc ""scene"". Then at some point a case broke (it must be in the slashdot archive) and the lawyers accusing people in it were quoting from email messages. As these people were using hushmail everybody started discussing as to how this was possible. Hushmail made a statement saying that if you used their java applet for entering your passphrase they could not do anything and you were safe as they never get your passphrase, but some of the people in the case had not used the applet at times. Their mistake. As they were being monitored at that time and the investigation was going on their passphrase was caught and used to decrypt their mailboxes. That was the first instance (around 2001). After that the distrust started and even though Hushmail kept their site the same (we in Canada, privacy, bla bla), behind the screens they must have been pressured or decided to rethink things. Fast forward to today were they state on their OWN website that they can SLIP you a COMPROMISED java applet if they need and work with the authorities and email messages from hushmail being used as evidence seem to be a common occurence. I see Hushmail as nothing more than any other email service today EXCEPT for the fact that they still x out your ip address in messages you sent, which is very nice. For the rest the privacy thing has become a facade. I am convined email boxes are not encrypted anymore as support can look into your inbox with ease (try them out).Down to their service they are not that great. You only get 1 gb of storage space when you pay for it. Free accounts still only get 25 mb LOL! ( they are still living in 1999). Sending attachments wih messages still uses a primitive method, didn't work in Opera at all for some time and maybe still, and overall the features they offer are nothing to write home about (much is lacking, but then again people came there for privacy and not for their assortment of smilies) although they are slowly revamping the interface. And people in the know (like us here) immediately sit up when they see someone is using hushmail. Had some issues of trust because of this, although I was using it for legitimate stuff. And to add that is just the outer layer of law enforcement (warrants, paperwork, etc). If you REALLY draw interest do you think Hushmail forms a barrier to the black projects/agencies out there?",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,backopy,3727,2013-03-22T12:08:00,Topic: Compiled hacking tools (Windows),The Classroom,"As general practice you should always avoid compiled hacking tools. You must keep in mind that if you're getting a ready-made software from a hacker there's no way to say he will not hack you. And no, using ""hacking tools"" will not make you a hacker, being a hacker requires mostly knowledge, isn't a push-button thing. But if you did got it, now what?  First inoculate the exe, you can do this by changing the extension from .exe to another non-executable MIME, such as .txtIf you can't see extensions, go to your folder and file options in the explorer and uncheck ""Hide extensions for known file types"".Now open it with Notepad. It's mostly unreadable, but scroll down to the manifest region, you can see something like: KERNEL32.DLL ADVAPI32.dll COMCTL32.dll GDI32.dll ole32.dll OLEAUT32.dll SHELL32.dll urlmon.dll USER32.dll VERSION.dll WININET.dll WINTRUST.dll  LoadLibraryA  GetProcAddress  VirtualProtect  VirtualAlloc  VirtualFree   ExitProcess   RegOpenKeyA   DPtoLP  CoInitialize  ShellExecuteA   IsValidURL  GetDC   VerQueryValueA  InternetOpenA   WinVerifyTrust These are Windows libraries and functions called by the executable. If you know what the executable is meant to do you can look this up for oddities, functions that are miles away of what the program was intended to do.Let's say you got a fast http server without service or run at boot functions, a call to RegOpenKeyA would be strange. What is it trying to read from the registry? If you find UPX in the header or UPX sections (UPX0, UPX1...) then it means the exe to be UPX compressed, you may need to create an uncompressed copy to analyze. You can do it by getting UPX and then using upx -d file.exe outfile.exe, be sure to backup the original file first and keep in mind that the outfile.exe will NOT be executable, it will have errors as it lost its imports during the extraction process, but it's now good to analyze with a tool like Ollydbg, IDA or PE Explorer. You'll be looking for mostly for strings, such as username:password files, like the one at appData\Mozilla Firefox\Profiles and alike, registry entries under Software\Microsoft\Windows. Try to match places and strings to the needed functions. DO NOT RELY ON ANTIVIRUS What you get here is mostly 0day stuff, antivirus relies on their own database to know if something is a virus or not, as usually it doesn't detect anything he doesn't know yet!",NA

It's an open- source software developed by the community. And it's free. If NSA deliberately installed backdoor inside the source code, the open source community would be able to identify and remove the malicious code. However, if the encryption software is available to the public for a price and it's own by a proprietary company then NSA can force them to install a backdoor, if the FISA court allows it. ============================================================== TrueCrypt FAQ: I forgot my password â is there any way ('backdoor') to recover the files from my TrueCrypt volume? We have not implemented any 'backdoor' in TrueCrypt (and will never implement any even if asked to do so by a government agency), because it would defeat the purpose of the software. TrueCrypt does not allow decryption of data without knowing the correct password or key. We cannot recover your data because we do not know and cannot determine the password you chose or the key you generated using TrueCrypt. If you follow the security requirements listed in this chapter of the documentation, then (to our best knowledge) the only way to recover your files is to try to ""crack"" the password or the key, but it could take thousands or millions of years (depending on the length and quality of the password or keyfiles, on the software/hardware performance, algorithms, and other factors). If you find this hard to believe, consider the fact that even the FBI was not able to decrypt a TrueCrypt volume after a year of trying.

Of course, they won't be able to crack it but they can tell the ""content"" of the encryption system. It's ideal for someone who has no idea of how hidden volumes works, but not against computer forensics.  Just encrypt your system HDD with AES 256 bit with a very long password (memorize it!!!) and you're good to go. Remember, if you live in UK and you refuse ot supply your password to decrypt the SSD/HDD -- it's automatic 5 years in prison/jail. Yeah, I know, its bullshit.  It would take NSA billion of years to decrypt an AES 256 encrypted SSD/HDD. As long you have a strong password. As for 35 gutman wipe - only if you have a new HDD.

I have a question: if FBI comes ramming down my door while my HDD is encrypted, taken into a room for interrogation - am I required to give them a password or no (lawfully speaking..)? - if you have a hidden system encryption in place. Computer forensics can look physically look at the HDD/SDD and determine how many GB the HDD/SDD have - say 60 GB. Now, if you revealed the outer volume and it's only has 30 GB. They probably want to know what happens to the rest of the 30 GB. As almost all computer forensics knows: it's probably a hidden volume. In this scenario, is it pointless to create a hidden volume? It may be ideal for mafias or someone blackmailing you.  Here's a better scenario: FBI raided my house and takes me to an interrogation site. No problem. Now they hit a dead end with my computer since my HDD/SDD is encrypted with AES 256. They asked me for a password but I will say, ""I don't remember, I got drunk last night. See my ticket? I went to a party two nights ago and I WAS DRUNK! SO DRUNK! I don't even remember anything."" This is considered plausible deniability. Maybe a blood work/tox is required to verify my story and if it checks out, not much they can do. If it doesn't check out, not mucht hey can do either; they probably can slap me a ""lying"" charge - entirely up to the judge - or some kind of conspiracy charges they can come up with - like they always do.  However, with hidden voume - if computer forensics finds out that HDD/SDD does have outer and hidden volume (TrueCrypt says they can see the content of the encryption system no problem) then part of plausible deniability might not work. You showed them the outer volume, but have no knowledge of the hidden volume while computer forensics thinks otherwise -- this might cause a problem. Again, since LE can't crack the contents of the HDD. not much they can do, either way. I would go with route #1 with not using the hidden system for the sake of plausible deniability. Let me know what you think.",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,sh4d3r1950,2515,2013-01-06T05:35:00,Topic: Your Data Safty Tool  -- True Crypt -- Usage Tutorial to stay S.A.F.E,Safety,"What is TrueCrypt? TrueCrypt, for those who don't already know, is an encryption software for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.  It is basically a way of creating areas of your hard drive that are encrypted so that you can hide sensitive data and information there. Furthermore, you are able to encrypt your entire hard drive so that at boot, your computer will not be able to start without entering the correct password.  This excerpt from TrueCrypt's website offers a more detailed explanation than I can provide: Documentation - TrueCrypt  Why should I use TrueCrypt? TrueCrypt is a must for anyone doing anything illegal or blackhat through the use of a computer.  Even if you are not participating in blackhat activities, there are still a plethora of reasons, limited only by your own creativity, as to why you would want to use TrueCrypt for privacy & safty. There is an interesting story going around about one individual that used TrueCrypt and avoided certain jail time because of it. For those that don't feel like reading it, basically the story is that this individual downloaded ""maybe 30"" CP images to see what it was like and ended up getting raided because of it. All of his computers were seized, and he was taken into custody. Upon analyzing his computer, they agents hit a dead end once they found that he had used whole drive encryption on all of his hardware. I'm sure there's more to the story that he has you believe about him not being involved in CP, but nevertheless, the story goes as on, & I am not much interested on CP or discuss the stories on that. this is just certain example for your idea & creativity, I gave here.  Is using TrueCrypt illegal? In some countries, the use of encryption of any kind is illegal. This includes TrueCrypt.  If you happen to live in one of these countries, are being charged with a cyber crime, and they find any encrypted contents on your hard drive, you can bet you're in for a rough time.They will physically beat the shit out of you and torture you into providing them with the password or key-files to the volume.Furthermore, it can even be illegal for you to transmit encrypted files from one country to another.I urge you to check up on the laws in your country and ensure that the methods outlined below are actually legal in your country and you're not just digging yourself a bigger hole.  If you live in the European Union countries like UK, Germany, France, Austria, Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Romania... etc  few Asian Countries like Russia, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan... etc United States, Canada... TrueCrypt is legal, and the passwords for your archives are protected under the Amendments & law on computer privacy. Even if you live in a country where it is illegal, there are things you can do to use TrueCrypt a bit more safely. One example is to use a Hidden Archive. This is basically like a suitcase with a false bottom. One password - the one you would give to authority's if interrogated and tortured - will open the archive and display certain contents, while the second password will open the same archive but display different contents.However, this doesn't change the fact that using encryption is illegal if you are in such a country.  My Disclaimer I sh4d3r1950 take no liability for consequences of using this tutorial - including hard drive failure, loss of data, and legal or illegal  action of any kind. Although I have striven to provide complete accuracy, and my time, this information is provided ""as is"" with no warranty.   Alright,============= Lets get started ===============  Download a copy of TrueCrypt for your system here  Encrypting File Containers and System Drives To start with, you're going to need to download and install TrueCrypt from above link. Simply select your operating system.If you are going to be encrypting a flash drive or external hard drive with TrueCrypt that you want to take with you wherever you go, and use the flash drive on computers that don't have TrueCrypt installed, you'll need a portable version of TrueCrypt that can be found in the same installer. [I recommend you to install complete on your operating system not as portable] It is a clean download link. direct from TrueCrypt official webpage. Once installed, You can get it yourself by navigating to the directory you have TrueCrypt installed to, and copying all the files in that folder to your flash drive or external HD.Simply copy the folder to your flash drive and you will be able to mount any file after opening TrueCrypt.exe There is another way to mount an encrypted flashdrive, but I'll go into that later.  Creating an Encrypted File Container Use this method if all you want to do is create a file as big as you want with encrypted contents that can be stored anywhere, and then mounted as a drive letter through TrueCrypt. [just similar like a .iso file and you mount it later]  Method #1 does not have the ""suitcase with a false bottom"" effect talked about earlier that Method #2 does. But both have their advantages and disadvantages.  Method #1: No Hidden Archive 1. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed. Then select ""Create Volume"".2. From the three choices, select ""Create an encrypted file container""3. Click Next and then select ""Standard TrueCrypt Volume"".  Click next again.4. Click ""Select File"" and navigate to the location on your hard drive where you want your volume to be, and specify a name for it. You actually have to give it a name, rather than just select a file. In my case for example, I simply named mine ""Volume 2"", as I already have a Volume 1 that I use. You can move and re-name this after it is created. 5. Make sure that the box ""Never Save History Is Checked"". And click next.6. Choose your encryption and hash algorithms. All methods are very strong and you're safe with them all. You can just leave them as the defaults (AES & RIPEMD-160).7. Enter the size of the volume that you wish to create.8. Enter your desired password. Ideally, make it longer than 35 characters. I don't recommend using keyfiles, because they can get deleted and you will be unable to recover the data in the archive. Just use a really good password consisting of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers. If you can't think of a password that is that long, try combining a few different passwords you may know, maybe a bank account number, some song lyrics, and keyboard configuration. Just basically anything that's going to get you to that length. This step is critical. Passwords are the biggest weakness.9. Next just move your mouse around randomly for as long as you have patience to do so, and then select format.10. Depending on the size of volume you chose to make, it may take a while to create a volume.11. That's it you're done!  You have learned to create a ""simple encrypted container""  Method #2: File Container with Hidden Archive 1. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed, on the tabs at the top, select the drop-down menu ""Volumes""2. Click ""Create New Volume""3. From the three choices, select ""Create an encrypted file container""4. Click Next and then select ""Hidden TrueCrypt Volume"". Click next again.5. Select ""Normal Mode"" from the two options available. You can experiment with Direct Mode if you wish, but it requires you to have a volume already made, that you wish to convert into a hidden archive.6. Click ""Select File"" and navigate to the location on your hard drive where you want your volume to be, and specify a name for it. You actually have to give it a name, rather than just select a file. The name and location can be changed after creation.7. Click next to begin specifying the options for the outer volume. This is the part of the volume that you are going to be giving up to someone in case something very bad happens. Ideally you should still use a strong password, and posssibly keyfiles to make it look legitimate.8. Next click ""Open Outer Volume"" and put in some documents that are somewhat sensitive that you may have a legitimate reason to hide.Examples of this could be your bank account statements, a text file containing your own passwords, documents outlining how to make explosives. Use your imagination. But make sure that whatever you put in there isn't going to get you in too much trouble, but that it still explains your purpose for using TrueCrypt.9. Click next. Now we begin to specify the settings for the hidden volume. It is important that you make this one stronger than the first with regards to password length etc.10. Next specify the space you wish your archive to fill. You are limited to the difference of the space between what you initially made your Outer Volume, minus the contents you put in your Outer Volume. e.g. (Outer Volume Space - Contents of Outer Volume = Max Space Available for Hidden Archive). So it's important to make sure that your Outer Volume is initially created with an adequate size for both your Outer and Hidden Volumes.11. Next enter your password and use and key-files that you may want for your Hidden Archive. If you still haven't got it yet, you need to use a separate password for both your Outer and Hidden Volumes.12. Depending on the size of volume you chose to make, it may take a while to create a volume. 13. And then you're done!  now in #2 you have learned to create encrypted outer volume & hidden volume in a ""container"" For instructions on how to mount and use your TrueCrypt file container see refer to the section ""Mounting Your TrueCrypt Volumes""  Encrypting a USB Drive or Drive Partition 1. Insert the flash drive or connect the external hard drive to the computer.2. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed, on the tabs at the top, select the drop-down menu ""Volumes"".3. Click ""Create New Volume"".4. Select ""Encrypt a non-system partition/drive"".5. Select whether you'd like to create a standard or hidden TrueCrypt volume. If you don't understand what these are, refer to an earlier section. For this demonstration, we will be creating a standard volume. If you are creating a hidden volume on a USB or system drive, the steps are the same as creating a hidden file container.6. Hit next, and then click ""Select Device"". This will bring up a list of all the drives attached to the computer.7. Select the drive or partition that you wish to encrypt from the list.8. Now there are two options at this step. If you have data on the drive that you wish to preserve, select ""Encrypt partition in place"" - it will take longer, but nothing will be deleted. This only works on NTFS Drives. Alternatively, if you don't really care about anything on the drive, or make a backup you plan on moving in, you can select ""Create encrypted volume and format it"" - This will delete all data on the drive! 9. Next select your encryption methods.10. Enter your desired password. Ideally, make it longer than 35 characters. I don't recommend using keyfiles, because they can get deleted and you will be unable to recover the data in the archive. Just use a really good password consisting of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers. If you can't think of a password that is that long, try combining a few differnet passwords you may know, maybe a bank account number, some song lyrics, and keyboard configuration. Just basically anything that's going to get you to that length. This step is critical. Passwords are the biggest weakness.11. Next click ""Format"" a dialog box will appear notifying you that all data on the drive will be deleted. Click OK to continue formatting.12. Depending on the size of volume you chose to make, it may take a while to create a volume. And then you're done! For instructions on how to mount and use your TrueCrypt volume, refer to the section ""Mounting Your TrueCrypt Volumes""  Encrypting a System Partition or Entire System Drive This is the method you would use if you are interested in full drive encryption. You will need to have TrueCrypt installed on your computer in order to do this. At this time, you are unable to run TrueCrypt in portable mode to encrypt your whole computer. [Highly recommended by me] We are also not going to go into hidden operating system's and duel boot setup's right now, as there are many YouTube video tutorials and articles online that outline this beautifully, and it is beyond the scope of this tutorial, as there are many possibilities. With the instruction below, you will simply learn how to encrypt your whole hard drive to be decrypted upon boot after the correct password is entered. Furthermore, if you decide that full drive encryption is not for you, you may decrypt it permanently, and also change the password if you desire. It is good advice to back everything up onto external hard drives before using this method in case something goes bad, and you loose your data, but it is not necessary.  In my experience, you will not notice your computer speed reduced at all by encrypting your entire hard drive.  1. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed, and then click on ""Create Volume"".2. Select ""Encrypt the system partition or entire system drive"" and click next.3. Select ""Normal"" and click next. You are free to experiment with the any other options, but I recommend starting with a  normal archive just to get your feet wet.4. Now when selecting which area to encrypt, I recommend you just select ""Encrypt the whole drive"".  You may choose the other one but the setup will change a little, and it is more for those with multi-boot setups.5. Next it will ask you whether you want to encrypt the ""Host Protected Area"".I recommend that you do not encrypt this (e.g. select NO), but again it is up to you to know whether your computer manufacturer uses these areas to store data or not. So assuming you selected No, click next to continue.6. Next click Single-Boot. Unless you have multiple operating systems and decide you want the other's encrypted as well. The majority of users here probably only have a single boot system.7. Now choose your encryption and hash algorithms. As noted earlier, all methods are very strong and you're safe with them all. You can just leave them as the defaults (AES & RIPEMD-160). If you wish to research more on the methods, and come to a conclusion on which is best, feel free to do so.8. Choose the password that you will use every time your computer is turned on. Do NOT forget this password. EVER. If you decide to change this later, you may. Also note that key-files are not supported for full drive encryption.9. Next just move your mouse around randomly for as long as you have patience to do so, and then select next.10. You will now have to create a ""Rescue Disk"" for three reasons that are outlined in the TrueCrypt dialog box. Please read over these steps and become familiar with them. The rescue disk will basically allow you to boot your operating system from a disk to repair it if something becomes damaged. Even if someone, including you, finds this disk, they will be unable to boot the computer without knowing the password. So again, DO NOT forget your password. So select the location where you want the save the ISO, and name the file.11. You will now need to burn this ISO to a disc. If you are confused about how to do this, or need software, just Google itI recommend PowerISO/UltraISO/ImgBurn/ImTooISO burner for burning ISO files. It can be found for download online [full versions contact me, PM me for custom listing on BMR]12. Upon successfully burning the ISO file to the disc, you can click next, and TrueCrypt will verify that you have done it correctly.13. Now you will have to decide what kind of Wipe Method you want to use. Depending on you computer's speed, and your patience, you can choose a different wipe method over another. This step basically help's keep the data secure and unrecoverable. Of course I recommend the Gutmann 35-pass method, but this is not appropriate for everyone. However, I suggest that you at least use SOME method of wipe.Please note that you will still be able to use your computer if you decide to use the Gutmann or DOD methods, it will simply run in the background when your computer is started until it finally finished wiping and encrypting. Just as an example, I have a 1TB hard drive, and when encrypting it, I used the Gutmann method. It took almost 4 days of running it non-stop on 8GB of RAM and an Intel 3rd gen quad 3.0 Ghz processor.14. After you have decided on a Wipe method, TrueCrypt will want to make sure everything is going to work properly in a System Encryption Pretest. Click Test. A dialog box will appear with instructions about what's going to happen, and what to do if something malfunctions. I recommend copying the contents of this to a text file and e-mailing it to yourself in case you need to read it from another computer.15. You will now have to restart your computer. Click ""Yes"" to restart.16. Upon booting up your computer, you will come to a black CMD screen which says ""TrueCrypt Boot Loader 7.0a - Enter Your Password"" etc.17. You will need to enter the password you chose here. It will then flash ""Booting"" across the screen and your operating system will be loaded like normal.18. Once your computer is booted, TrueCrypt will be loaded and it will tell you that the Pre-Test was completed successfully. Next click Encrypt to start encrypting. It will give you another dialog box pop-up. It is a good idea to copy this down in a text file and e-mail it to yourself like the last set of instructions.19. Now it will start encrypting your hard drive. Depending on whether you chose a wipe method or not, and how large your hard drive is, this can take anywhere from an hour or so all the way up to weeks before it completes. As explained earlier, you can still use your computer while this process works in the background.20. After it is done encrypting, TrueCrypt will now tell you that it has completed the encryption successfully. Hit ""OK"", and then finish.  ================ now lets learn mounting steps ===============  Mounting Your TrueCrypt Volumes Now that you've made your TrueCrypt volumes, you may be wondering, well how the hell do I access these super-duper-highly-secure-and-encrypted volumes?This depends on the type of drive you created earlier that you are trying to mount. We will run over the three different types.   Mounting an Encrypted File Container The method is the same for mounting both hidden and normal volumes. If you wish to mount either the public or hidden portion of a hidden archive, simply use the different password that you specified while creating your volume. 1. Open TrueCrypt and select the drive letter that you wish to mount your volume to.2. Click ""Select File"" and navigate to the location that you have your file container at and select your container. Then click open.3. Next click ""Mount"", with the drive letter you want your volume to be mounted as.4. You will be prompted to enter your password, and load any key-files that you may have used. Leave the box ""Cache passwords and keyfiles in memory"" unchecked. After loading any keyfiles, and/or entering your password, click OK.5. You will now see your drive mounted under ""My Computer"" and TrueCrypt as the drive that you selected when you mounted it. You may choose any available drive from letters A-Z.6. It now act's like a normal drive. You can cut, copy, paste anything to and from the drive.7. When you are done with the archive, you may dismount it.8. Dismount the drive by ensuring that every process or location utilizing that drive is first closed to prevent damage to the volume.9. Next, select the drive from TrueCrypt, and select Dismount. The drive will disappear from TrueCrypt and from My Computer   Mounting a USB Drive or Encrypted Drive Partition There are two ways to use TrueCrypt with a USB/Flash Drive/External Hard Drive. â¢ Encrypt the entire drive so that there is no empty space left on it.- This is the method outlined earlier under ""Encrypting a USB Drive or Encrypted Drive Partition"".It will require you to have TrueCrypt installed on the computer that you are trying to mount the removable media to. â¢ Create an encrypted file folder large (or small) enough to fit onto the flash drive or external hard drive.- It allows you to actually have TrueCrypt on the removable device so that it's contents may be mounted wherever you are. I highly recommend this method over the first for removable storage like USB drives but not for External HD. If using this method, the way to mount the drive is exactly the same as mounting an Encrypted File Container because, well, that's exactly what it is. But, for external HDs I recommend Encrypt entire HD with hidden volume If you have decided to encrypt your entire external hard drive or flash drive, then you will need to follow a slightly different set of instructions which is outlined below. Remember that for this way, you need to have TrueCrypt installed on the computer in order to mount the volume.  1. Open up TrueCrypt, and this time, instead of clicking ""Select File"", click ""Select Device"".2. Have your device (USB/External HD) already connected to the computer.3. Next select your device from the list of available devices and partitions, then click OK.4. From here on out it is just like mounting a file container. If you initially created a hidden folder on your device/drive, you can enter a differnet password to get to that area of the drive.5. It will then become visible under TrueCrypt, and My Computer, as the drive letter that you specified for it when mounting.6. To dismount, make sure all folders and processes utilizing the drive are closed, then simply highlight the drive in TrueCrypt and select ""Dismount"".  Mounting a System Partition or Entire System Drive This is the easiest drive to mount. Once you turn on the computer with the encrypted hard drive, you will be prompted to enter the password at a command line looking screen. Upon entering the correct password, your operating system will boot. If you wish to disable TrueCrypt in the task bar after booting your system, follow these steps:1. Open TrueCrypt, and under settings, at the top, select preferences.2. Uncheck the box ""Start TrueCrypt Background Task"" under ""Actions to perform upon logon to windows""3. Click OK and then Exit. Restart to see the changes take place. You will notice that TrueCrypt no longer is in the task manager, and that it is not running in the processes under Task Manager  Useful Tips and Tricks  â¢ Tip #1: When working with detected files, malware in particular, it can often times be frustrating when your Anti-Virus deletes the files that you are using. To avoid this problem, add an exclusion in your Anti-Virus as an entire drive letter, such as drive Z:\. Then create a TrueCrypt file container, and inside the TrueCrypt volume, keep all the files that are detected, along with all your hacking material. Mount this file container as that drive letter you added to your exclusions list in your AntiVirus.This keeps all of your sensitive files safe from prying eyes, and allows you to scan your entire computer for infections, with the TrueCrypt volume dismounted, without worrying about false positives. Nothing gets in, and nothing gets out, without your permission.  â¢ Tip #2: Think about setting up a Virtual Machine that you do alot of your hacking from, and keep this in a TrueCrypt container. This will make it so that some of the temporary files, time, and system logs that Windows and other operating systems keep are never found, and there will be no evidence, or time log against you in case of a lawsuit. You can use your normal operating system, but you need to be good at deleting your logs using a secure deletion method.  I recommend five main things to stay safe. First, use a VPN + Socks/RAT proxy to Hide Your Ass and avoid being aprehended in the first place. Truecrypt is your second line of defense. And if you decide, your third line of defense is a hidden file container.  Secondly, you must have whole drive encryption. I don't care if you have multi-booting operating systems or not, but whole drive encryption is a must! Third, I recommend that you keep everything that is hacking related or otherwise illegal locked inside a highly secure file container on your encrypted hard drive somewhere. Make this container as big as you need. double protection. Fourth, use a strong password! I'm talking dozens of characters long. I gave some hints earlier about how you can memorize a password of this length. DO NOT write it down.  Fifth, if you are not going to reformat your entire hard drive, wipe the data, and start over with a clean slate, which I recommend - nothing beats a fresh reformat, then you need to wipe down the free space of your hard drive using a secure deletion method. Lastly, I took much time writing, editing, formatting & posting it here for BMR users to stay safe. have some pity on my private time spent on this. just worth my effort fellows. If you need a Screenshot/Video tutorial, ask me, I will prepare my own fresh and make you a custom listing to buy  Stay Safe. What??? Still did not download TrueCrypt ??

If you're forced to give up your password, you give the authorities the ""outer"" volume password, and they will only see what you put in the outer volume.  More importantly, they will not be able to prove that the hidden volume even exists.",NA

Everyone seems to have their own opinion on the subject. Is a PO box any more secure than a street address? Opening one using a fake ID is certainly an option, but if it gets found out as a fake then that's going to raise some huge flags. You could argue that shipping using your IRL info allows one to hide in plain site but it also takes away all plausible deniability. Home address with a fake name?

There is no visible vidalia (although it may be running underneath, just not visibly).  My problem is that there's no way to add (or even use) bridges. How is a person who is used to getting new bridges every few days to augment his security deal with this? Another thing: when you click on new identity using the torbutton, it seems the browser closes and reopens immediately, but you're not where you were before! You're back to the torcheck page. This is stupid! What are those tor developers thinking? All they're doing is making things more difficult for users, especially the unexperienced ones, and as a corollary, shooting themselves in the foot. Fewer people will want to use Tor.  I though the idea was to increase the number of Tor users to have security, and more anonymity, in numbers. Monty",NA

And as far as setting up bridges, when you first start the browser you are given the option of either connecting directly to the Tor network or making configuration changes/connecting to a bridge. The change in ""new identity"" functionality is annoying, but it is a necessary feature to discard the browser state. Hopefully they will implement something similar to the old ""new identity"" button that will allow you to change Tor circuits without discarding the browser state. By eliminating the Vidalia GUI, TorProject has made the browser simpler, and thus likely to be used by more people.",NA

Cut one of the wires and make it pass by the doorbell button, so that without the button pressed no power reaches the female socket. Connect your charger or power cord to that female socket.Remove any batteries, if it is a laptop, leave the button at the ground near you and step over it. Keep your foot there until you no longer need to access your safe system.

The NSA will probably not be involved in any crime you commit  Mostly, at least in smaller countries, the police does not have any clue about encryption, etc., and no meanings to decrypt even a caesar cipher  BUT they will have the means to search your home quite thoroughly, request camera-data from cameras you might not be aware of, on the street, in bars, on ATMs, ...

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,10897,2013-10-27T19:56:00,Topic: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"I'm asking this question because I can't seem to find a thread that focuses on it with the search function. If there happens to be info that I missed, please let me know.  Let's have a hypothetical discussion: Let's say you're enormously successful at whatever business you're undertaking. You've successfully implemented a strategy of anonymity using a mixture of TOR, Tails, VPN's, virtual OS, proxies, etc. Your profits come in the form of Bitcoins, which are tumbled with BMR, then withdrawn into a clean wallet. BTCs are then sent to an independent tumbler, just for good measure, then deposited to yet another wallet. Your funds are then converted on a clearnet site, and wired to an offshore account that has no personal information to jeopardize you. You even have a debit card you can use with the account. Here is where things get interesting: Let's be fanciful and imagine you've squirreled away about 20 million in USD in your various offshore accounts. How do you manage that money safely? 1) Traveling: I know you can buy airline tickets with BTC now, and you can reserve your hotel with one of your offshore debit cards. If you're still traveling under your real name, is this safe? Will the IRS or other entity come wondering about the first class tickets and hotel stays that didn't come from your clearnet bank account(s)? 2) Transfer: Is there a safe way to transfer a portion of that money--say, 10 million--to your real identity? The purpose would be as an investment. If you buy 10 million dollars worth of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) with a 30 year maturity, that yields $100,000 a month, every month, for the next 30 years in dividends. At the end of that time, the initial investment is returned to you. How would one go about doing this? Set up a disposable IBC, buy the securities, transfer them to you, and then dissolve the IBC? Suspicious, sure, but is there a better way? 3) Purchasing property with your offshore account: Houses, cars...? Is this possible? That amount of money may or may not be very realistic, but it'd be interesting to discuss how we manage our secret earnings, especially as a resource for those--like me--who are looking to make money. Anyone care to chime in?",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,jbs,10897,2013-10-30T06:04:00,Re: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"My personal(!) opinion is that if you keep a low profile, and pay the tax after your earnings (yes, I know this sounds ridiculous now), you can be safe. Keep a low profile. I don't know how much money you make (and sure it's not my business), but I can imagine that dealing with $10 million is not an easy thing, and may easily cause attention.Maybe keep those 'coins somewhere safe (save them for later in a private wallet), and always exchange only an amount you currently need. You can have a nice lifestyle without having much attention.  And the second thing is (and this is why you must keep it low (or medium) profile) to pay the tax.  I think you won't have any problems with authorities if:- they cannot find ANY evidence about illegal activities, even if they search your home and computer- you comply with your country's rules by paying the tax after your incomes, which further proves that you are a law-abiding citizen. (Because on the other hand, if you buy a luxury house, a red Ferrari, and other expensive things, while living on a poor teacher's salary (or even bankrupt) on paper, THIS can cause you problems, and may start an investigation.)Everyone hates paying taxes, but if you have that much income, don't be a fool to slip on a minor glitch like this one.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,10897,2013-10-31T01:14:00,Re: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"Thanks all for your input! I really appreciate your interest and advice. These are all excellent points. I was actually considering doing something very similar. Legally, I'm a copywriter who gets paid via Paypal. Paypal sends a 1099 to the IRS every year, and I pay taxes on that. I was thinking of creating an offshore IBC to serve as my employer, then pay myself from IBC bank account to IBC paypal to my paypal, and pay taxes on that. That way, my payment method remains the same. I would do this for a portion of my earnings. So many of these legitimate transactions happen through Paypal, that there would be nothing out of the ordinary with it. Truth be told, I'm one of those who worries about the future of the country. Politics, stability, blah blah. I'm a resident of the US, but I spend most of my time traveling around the world. So any ""big"" purchases (house, car, etc.) would most likely occur outside of the country, and via LLC or land trust to preserve the anonymity of the anonymous name that is already attached. Most of my wealth will remain offshore and diversified. Less for tax avoidance, and more for my personal peace of mind. Don't really trust the gov't enough to keep all my eggs in one basket. Not anymore. When I'm in the US, and when my real name is involved, I will always draw on my funds described above. Unless I'm paying cash. Otherwise, I like the idea of keeping the bulk of my money spread out across the globe, and rather incognito. It's a geographical spin on Portfolio Management 101.  I'd rather be paranoid and wrong, than wind up unprepared and correct. You guys see anything wrong with the above strategy? There would be a website, and requisite paper trail for the appearance of legitimacy. Real articles that would be outsourced, etc.",NA

Thing with copywriting is that your proof of work would be large volumes of writing! Also, what happens when they go to contact your 'clients' - your clients' identities would surely be readily discernible via the substance of the writing you'd done. Find a service where proof of work disappears when the work is completed. Someone I know in a country I won't name has a string of barber's shops and hairdressers where income is inserted into the partnership structure as far as the books are concerned.  Employees are on a flat (low) fee, regardless of whether they do one or 100 haircuts a day.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,10897,2013-10-31T21:59:00,Re: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"Traditional money laundering methods may prove difficult though. Most of those are based on the idea of an actual laundry - a place where many people pay in cash. This can be a laundry, hair salon, restaurant, bar, gym, or even a carwash (have an A1 day!).  The problem is that people do not pay with bitcoins for everyday items (yet). You can cash out BTC to a wire transfer perfectly well with exchanges like bitstamp, but booking that money directly into an offshore bank account is probably still suspicious.  There are ways to put the 'laundry' idea into more modern concepts though. Services like VPS and hosting are more and more commonly accepting BTC payment for clients that wish to remain anonymous. You could set up a VPS service that actually has few real customers, but create a thousand of fake customers that each pay $10 a month for this service.  Obviously you would have to automate a process that tumbles a thousand $10 transactions a month towards that service, but that is not impossible to do at all. As long as you tumble the transactions well it is very well possible to fund your own VPS business from a single account with thousands of bitcoins in it without this being overly obvious and with limited cost.  So, if you are in the luxurious position where you have to convert a million a year in btc to plausible legal income, you'll now need bot a good accountant and a very good programmer",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,10897,2013-10-31T23:28:00,Re: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"Excellent ideas! My real question is this, though:  If I go with the copy writing idea (not hard to generate articles, I've got that covered), retained by a website that has a branch dedicated to articles based on...whatever. The website and attached IBC/account is based outside of the country, and I merely get paid to write the articles...why the investigation? If I were pulling in a couple hundred thousand to a million a year, that would be a bit suspicious. I'm only thinking five to seven grand a month, tops, and that would be before taxes. If I do get audited, all they'd see is my legal revenue stream, articles on the site under my name, and a history of PayPal payments. As far as I know, unless I go out and by something absurdly expensive in my own name, publicly live absurdly beyond my means, there would be no need for suspicion. Even if Government Entity became suspicious, everything connected to my real identity is perfectly legitimate. Standard payment method using a revenue stream from a small international company that has no ties to me. Proof of work for profit, taxes paid... The only weak link is tracing where said international business gets its money, and that investigation into the foreign company would need to happen first. Using the appropriate disposable set up, throw in a few bitcoin mixers, and their revenue stream is certainly suspicious. Ben, your hosting idea is great. My only concern with it, is that it would be bitcoin based. With the way things are going, I don't want to base an operation on BTC sustainability. I'm taking advantage of BTC now, while I can, but I don't intend on staying with it by any means. Not with any serious investiture of revenue, anyway. I like the idea of VPS, but with the amount of money being funneled into that company, via bitcoin transfer, I have no idea how to make that look legit...",NA

Something like writing copy or even code could be a very realistic cover for something in the order of $100k a year. Especially if it is for a foreign client, though accepting payment in BTC could still look suspect. It may be possible to convert the BTC to paypall credit first which makes it a more credible means of payment, but since paypall is a US company this could also easily be disclosed. The poker idea also has merit, especially if it is a site that is not based in the US (or whatever country you reside in).  Setting up a scheme where you often loose money to your alter-ego would be quite easy as you can see eachothers cards, and can basically wait for a 'battle of the blinds' round to conduct your large bets.  Such behaviour would be very suspicious to fellow players in a game, but they might not mind it very much since they stand little to lose from the dogfights between your two players. You could possibly even conceal your cards by making your 'winner' player raise and then your 'loser' player fold despite having put a considerable amount of money in the pot.  This is unusual too, but i wonder if poker websites care about it at all, as long as they make some commission on your dealings",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,10897,2013-11-05T22:11:00,Re: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"I have no experience with that company in particular.  If you already have an offshore company in place that receives your proceeds in a common currency (usd/eur/etc, from a btc exchange) you are well on your way to laundering the money.  Just providing services like copywriting from your domesting company and billing the offshore one for it would basically suffice. Obviously you will have to pay income and/or corporate tax on that money, but that could be an acceptable loss if you intend to live off it and are not about to emigrate.  I would advise not to take out any more money then you actually need though, and keep savings on the balance of the offshore company. At some point in time you may choose to move to another country that probably has lower corporate and/or income taxes. The best thing would be to incorporate there once you get settled and then transfer the money for services. This obviously saves money otherwise evaporating in taxes, but it may also help to keep you under the radar a bit: large transactions are suspect by default in the US and EU, but they may not draw much attention in a tax haven since people do them there all the time, mostly as tax evasion for perfectly legal activities.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,2fruits,10897,2013-11-16T03:59:00,Re: Managing Profits Made From Deep Web Activities,Safety,"The ""casino"" trick works very well for laundering money and is in fact a common method used by the Mafia here. Simply go to a casino, buy chips, and cash out. This then becomes ""winnings"" which in many countries isn't taxable. It also explains the presence of large amounts of money via cash deposits in your bank - ""oh, I won at blackjack"" or whatever. If you have a constant flow of income in bitcoins you'll usually either want to localbitcoins.com it for cash deposits, or create a shell company. An online company selling intangible services (e.g. graphic design, web design, consultancy etc.) is great for this purpose, because you can invent names of overseas ""clients"" that don't exist. Heck, you can even just use http://www.fakenamegenerator.com  to generate these details for the purpose of invoicing. The shell company allows you to launder money, at the cost of having to pay taxes on that money. Generally, though, if you are paying almost all tax on declared revenues, and deducting only minimal and obvious expenses, you won't attract the attention of the taxman. However you MUST be sensible and not make silly ""giveaway"" mistakes like not making ANY deductibles claims (who does that in real business? Nobody, that's who) or by suddenly going from a startup to a $20 million company in six months. If you're super smart you'll actually buy a real company too, because that's a nice way to hedge your bets and continue a good living even when you retire from the drugs business.",NA

I've heard from people who use it all the time and no problem. PGP is perfectly legal so they have no grounds to do anything even if they wanted to. I'm not saying its as good as your system. Your system sounds really complicated with all the stuff you have to dl and set up. The nice thing about tor was it was simple and easy. The more complicated something is the more chance to screw it up. I figure i would screw it up. Wouldn't the recipient of the message in your system have to have the same set up? If not, they could get his ip and maybe follow the reply back. I don't know, i just feel like this will be too hard for me. Its probably good for the highly tech savvy.",NA

This is accomplished by the  PATH  environment variable. Unfortunately the original gnupg.org Windows installer does not modify the  PATH , so you must do it manually: on a Windows NT/2000/XP system, open Settings â System â Advanced â Environment Variables and edit the  PATH  variable under System variables. In the edit field, add  ;C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG  to the end of the Path and then click OK three times. On a Windows 9x system, edit  C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT  and add  ;C:\Progra~1\GNU\GnuPG  to the end of the  PATH  statement."" You only have to check where's your gpg-installation (especially gpg.exe) is locatedand this directory you've put in the PATH-Variable as shown above.For ex: add "";C:\Program Files (X86)\GNU\GnuPG"" if you have a 64 bit Windows7 or 2008(for 32-bit Windows the above example from the install-guide should work).

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,WhiteCrane,6066,2013-08-07T00:04:00,Topic: Hard drive safety,The Classroom,"Many people don't know that even though you may wipe your hard drive, a determined and well resourced attacker can still access your data. The process is long, complicated, and costly, but if you have attracted the attention of the alphabet agencies, they may make time for you. You say ""But all my stuff is encrypted"". That's great, but if the LEO kick in your door one day, the best you can hope for is to yank the power out of the computer. This is fine for their initial search, but a determined and seasoned analyst can usually pull your encryption key out of RAM. How do they do all of this? For the RAM, they use a program that performs a hardware level dump of data on the RAM disks. These can be assembled by the technician and some proprietary tools. There is a time limit in doing this because as the charge within the RAM dies off, so to does the data within (*Factoid: RAM does not instantly lose its memory holdings when the power is lost, it takes from 30 sec up to a minute for RAM to totally clear) So how do I protect myself? The best way to protect your self is to first - not use spinning media (standard hard drives). You should keep all of your data on encrypted SSDs or Flash drives. If your door gets kicked in, dismount your media and time permitting, run a ""ZERO"" pass over the first 2048 sectors of your media. Note: In order to do this, you must be running Linux, and you must have your file Root system on a separate partition with your wiping tool a permanent resident in RAM. Also keep your password in your head, and your encryption key file on the first sectors of your disk. DO NOT DIVULGE YOUR PASSWORD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, YOU MUST TELL THEM THERE WAS A KEY-FILE THAT WAS ACCIDENTALLY DESTROYED. To clean your ram, you can do one of two things: 1. Time permitting, pull it out of the computer and destroy it physically2. Pull the plug and flip a can of air upside down, spray the RAM with the upside down can of air ** WARNING: THE CAN WILL BECOME VERY COLD ** These tips should help you prevent a forensic analyst from ever yanking usable data from your encrypted disks. Summary: Do not use spinning mediaUse Linux with your sensitive data mounted on a secondary partitionIn case of emergency, dismount and ""ZERO"" first 2M of drive (encryption key + headers)Use a can of air to cool the RAM, or physically destroy it Bonus: If you're using *nix, you can use the following shell script to unmount and wipe the first sectors of your encryption headers, assuming your drive is ""sdc"" and you have the first partition mounted: #!/bin/bash echo ""Wiping secure drive""umount /dev/sdc1dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc count=2Mecho ""Done.. powering off""shutdown -h 0 (Forgive me if my syntax is out of date, I use FreeBSD)",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,fractalglobal,6066,2013-11-11T06:12:00,Re: Hard drive safety,The Classroom,"It should be noted that this is only the case if they are able to physically access your hard drive. I.E. Police raid or someone breaking into your house and stealing it.  To explain the process in a slightly simplistic manner, when you delete something from your computer's hard drive, the data itself is not deleted, only the 'marker' that the computer uses to identify that block of data as whatever file it is.  When the marker is gone, the data will be overwritten in time, but if unused, there are programs that can reconstruct the data into the original file without the need for the marker.  The only way this could ever be achieved would be if the police were able to execute the raid, identify that the computer contains encrypted data and that they would need to have the RAM analyzed in order to access it, remove the sidepanel from the casing of the computer, remove the ram chips without damaging it, and finally, have a readily available canister full of liquid nitrogen they could immerse the ram in in order to prevent the data from being lost.This would all have to be done within a minute of the victim of the raid realizing it was occuring and pulling out the power cord.Some law enforcement agencies briefly looked into this, but I don't believe it has ever been successfully done in a real world scenario.  It's so absurdly impractical and unreliable.  Alternatively, a gram of powdered rust and a gram of powdered aluminium which has been thoroughly mixed, then wrapped in saranwrap/clingwrap and kept on top of your HDD can be used to reliably prohibit any potentially incriminating data from being lifted.  Just have a sparkler sitting next to the computer, if you become aware of a raid occuring, light the sparkler and touch it to the mixed powders.  The thermite will eat through the casing of the hard drive, and irreparably destroy the platters.  No SSD/flash drives necessary.   Regardless, if the data is encrypted, it really doesn't matter whether or not they can seize your HDD as they will need your key(which cannot be recovered from your RAM in a real world scenario) to decrypt it. To pre-empt any questions about them 'cracking' the encryption, here's a passage from 'Applied Cryptography.'  A book written by someone widely regarded as one of the foremost experts in the field. Note: This is assuming the energy could be harnessed and used with 100% efficiency(once the issue of building a dyson sphere has been resolved, of course!)  3. Bucket of water poured onto the computer.  Shorts the ram out, instantly clears the blocks, and removes any possibility of using liquid nitrogen to preserve it due to Leidenfrost effect.4. Hammer. Also, number 2 will actually have the opposite effect to what you want.  It will cool the ram down considerably, resulting in it being able to retain data longer than if you had done nothing. While these methods will undoubtedly protect someone from having their data recovered by LEO/whoever,  sometimes the simplest of solutions can be as effective/reliable, and easier to implement for those unfamiliar with the more technical aspects of IT.",NA

It weakens your sub-key encryption therefore it makes it easier for LE to decrypt your message with ease. You can thank NSA for that. Last I heard, kleopatra doesn't have any sub-key encryption at all. Or just weakened it from 128 bit to 56 bit.  Use Tails OS - it has a built-in PGP encryption. Sub-key by default is 128 bit. The purpose of the sub-key is to encrypt your message with 1024-4096 bit. Without it, your message is NOT encrypted. It may look encrypted, but it's in weakened state.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,WhiteCrane,12122,2013-11-06T14:57:00,Topic: Offshore Banking for [Real] Dummies,The Classroom,"I have noticed a lot of threads on here lately that are all addressing questions that could be answered with about thirty seconds of Google searching. I'm going to first clear up some misconceptions regarding offshore banking, and then we'll move on to opening and operating an offshore entity.  It is illegal to have an offshore account  This is not the case, it is perfectly legal to own, and to operate, an offshore company. There are many reasons why people operate these, some people, like myself, work with clients all over the world and for their records, they'd prefer to not be sending money to the United States... so having an offshore account enables them to just pay me directly as opposed to routing it through a holding bank.  Do I have to pay taxes on foreign held funds? In the USA at least, you can operate an offshore account and NOT report it if it has a balance of LESS THAN $10,000 in cash or equivalents. If you're not a US resident, things get easier because it's unlikely your government will pursue your money like the IRS will. Never the less, with this new act called FATCA - that is the Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act, there is a NON-TAXABLE limit of $50,000.  What this means, is that you MUST REPORT all offshore funds over the $10,000 limit, but you are only taxed on having reported offshore accounts in excess of $49,999.99  What if I don't report it?  If you fail to disclose your offshore holdings, and the IRS finds out, you will be audited; your funds frozen, and you will have to pay in upwards of a 45%-60% fee (well, they call it a Tax, but we'll call a dog a dog).. you may also face additional fines, penalties, and even maybe prison time (tax evasion).. If however, you do not report it, and they do not learn of it, then there will be no actions against you.    Starting an offshore corporation  I'm not going to dance around and recommend this jurisdiction or that jurisdiction. What I will do is to give you an example jurisdiction. For the sake of discussion, we're going to use Seychelles.  Seychelles is a small island network that is roughly 90 miles north east of Madagascar. It's a tropical economy, relying on foreign investment through their money services, or through tourism. Seychelles has several advantages like a non-public corporate registry, and absolute secrecy surrounding corporations. To start an offshore corporation, unless you have a PO BOX in Seychelles, you will have to hire someone to act as your registered agent. To do this, you will hire a company to act as your go between. You will fill out a form with them, and submit ID to them - for the ""Know your customer"" checks. Following this, you will pay a fee.  There are several companies that offer these services. Don't waste your money on their ""bank introduction service,"" all that is, is they will send an e-mail to someone at the bank stating that you are a person who would like to open an account. They cannot open the account on your behalf. The main reason why I am picking on Seychelles here is because it's cheap, even to hire a company.  To form a company in Seychelles, you will spend between $500 and $700. Here's a list of companies, from cheapest to more expensive. I personally don't think you get your money's worth through these companies since they just submit the documents and pay the fees to the respective boards and trustees.  http://www.unitrustcapital.com/schedule.html - Charges start at $490http://www.seychellesoffshore.com/ - Charges start at $670  Are there annual fees? Sadly, yes. Fees will depend on jurisdiction and will range from $350 -> $1000 or more.     Now tell me about my mystical offshore bank account!!!  Before we go any further, I want you readers to drop any and all mysticism surrounding offshore banking. It's nothing special... regardless of what Hollywood, the media, or the piece of shit politicians say on the matter, there is NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THEM!!!! Now, having said that, let's begin. There's two ways to look at this.  If you're a US citizen  You need to look at these banks specifically: http://www.belizebank.com/online-banking/http://www.atlanticibl.com/ I would avoid this bank, as they require documentation for EVERY incoming wire. http://www.choicebankltd.com/index.php   If you are NOT a U.S. citizen  I HIGHLY recommend EuroPAC: http://europacbank.com/   Okay, that's all great, but can you do this for me? Can I use a stolen identity to have a TRULY ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT????!!!!!! OMGROFLBBQ!!!!!11111 Calm down there sparky.  1. I do not advise using any identification but your own for an offshore account. There are several reasons for this, chiefly... if something happens, and you need to get your funds out through legal channels (through a lawyer), you must have a legally authorized passport to do this. 2. I cannot do this for you. It takes about two hours of time to set all of this up. After that, it takes a couple days to be granted a company, then about a week to set up the banking. 3. There is no such thing as a truly anonymous account. Deal with it.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Turd_Russell,318,2012-04-26T19:22:00,Topic: Rules to stay safe,Safety,"OK, on a personal note, I've come across so many people here doing rookie mistakes. Learn from our mistakes (Yes, most of us got scammed big time before, but we learned our lesson and try to warn you) and watch out for these things: 1. Always stay in escrow!2. No up front payment! (No real vendor asks for that. We have Shipment escrow and Main escrow. Shipment can be released upon request and the main escrow stays until the deal is done. Also watch out if the Shipping Escrow is higher than usual, meaning half of the price!)3. Underpriced goodies (No one gives away free stuff unless is promotion, the seller can't use it [c.f. 4. and 8.] or bulk buy)4. Vague answers or no answers (there is a question box in the listings, so answers can be seen by anyone. Scammers don't or can't answer ""good"" questions)5. Read the feedback AND what has been sold. Some scammers give away free stuff or sell stuff for .00001BTC to get good feedback, then put up pricy listings and major scam the sh*t out of the people. Or do 50% real deals, 50% fakes, so it doesn't get visible soon.6. Read the forum! Always read the forum, there are others who have been scammed and rant about it (like this post).7. Always stay in escrow! It's there for the safety of your money, don't go out of escrow, because someone needs the money for shipping etc.8. If you want proof, ask for a pic with a timestamp or a word of your choice written down. Good vendors can do that, bad ones use only Google images.9. If you smell fish, HANDS OFF! Better safe than sorry. There are other vendors, maybe a bit more expensive, but legit.10. This one is for buyers: Be nice. Nice always pays out (like bonus stuff or price reductions), at least, that's what I think and do. Each one has what the other wants (e.g. goods vs Bitcoins)11. Look up, when the seller was last online. Some scam, never show up again and you have to bother the Admin.12. ALWAYS STAY IN ESCROW!!! (Can't stress that enough!) I hope this helps.

Always stay in escrow.16. Think before buying. Sometimes an item is worth way more than to be sold (e.g. guns), ask yourself, why someone is selling something for 50BTC when its worth is over 100 (hint: scam!)17. If you encounter something strange or a scam: report, so others don't fall for the same trap! 18. Asking for early finalizing from 0 feedback buyers is (in my opinion) a try to scam the noobs.

If not: You upload your Bitcoins to your wallet, located on the top right corner of your BMR customer page. As soon as it has arrived (I think it needs 5 confirmations), you can purchase the item or items of your choice. You can then release the shipment escrow, in order not to p*ss off the vendor. As soon as you have received and checked the goods (and all is well), THEN you release the remaining escrow, write a little feedback for the vendor and the same will be done for you. Ergo: Products and money where it belongs, (hopefully) positive feedback given and received, all are happy and can continue using the product and/or spending the Bitcoins! Ta-daaaaaa!",NA

Some newbs get talked into sending money via Western Union or other currencies, because they don't know where to get Bitcoins to go shopping. It's like laughing at a dead rat: One can't do shit, the other one laughing is just a retard. Level 1 means selling and buying in one account, Level 2 means just selling (with a few benefits), no buying. Also, I just came across this:19. A vendor surely is more than honored by early feedback and the trust put into him (at least I am), but what if a bad guy sends you an empty envelope with a tracking number and you give good feedback without having the product in your hands?

Even if it meant paying more, always.  It is too much of a risk and if the deal went wrong, I would be angry at myself and then look for someone else to buy off, which costs me more than paying a little extra to begin with from someone who did not ask to finalize early.

If buyer is high rated and no proof of delivery then 100% refund. aname, if you knew how many buyers make a new name everytime they buy something, you would be surprised. Then of course they never finalize. The seller has to keep track of who did not finalize, send them a pm, wait for a reply and then put in a dispute. And maybe the zero feedback buyer gives a negative. What can he lose? Nothing, he is going to make a new name next time anyway so he has some fun with the vendor. Not much fun if you are the vendor. >Controversial thought. See also the other side: If a vendor has proven himself with (minor) sales, he is in the position of legitimized scamming, as has fulfilled the needs for demanding FE. They do that now, brand new vendors with high price goods, no feedback or a little fake feedback asking FE. There should be a rule that vendors can not ask FE until they have been here a certain amount of time and have a certain level of feedback. Only then should they be alloweld to ask FE and it is still the buyers privilege to say no.  No one has to FE but if you are zero feedback with no presence on the board, you can FE on my listing or go to someone else's. I will lose some business but i will not have the hassle. Its not hard to get feedback, just be honest and buy something. If you can't FE on your very first buy, then what is the problem? After that then you have feedback.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,MKIVModel,4363,2013-12-11T11:46:00,Re: Authorized User Trade Lines for Credit Cards,The Classroom,"I used to have fucked up credit, had my first credit card at 15 and ran an Ebay business into the ground at 18, leaving me broke and legally obligated to my debts, and a credit score of about 400. Took me 3 years to be back into normal range. Word of advice: Even if you paid everything off in full today, your credit score will barely move an inch. It's how it's designed and it's retarded. You score goes up by building months/years of on-time payments and NEVER being late. So let's get started, don't pay off in full, for now, this will be a slow process but shouldn't cost you any than a few envelopes and phone calls to the write people. Also remember to make your minimum payments, even 1 late is catastrophic. PS: learned everything I know from clearnet, creditboards.com, debtorboards.com, and myfico forums, and alot of trial and error. First, get a secured credit card. It's where you put up your own money ($100-$300) and get issued a card that reports as a credit card. Use your card just once a month, and it counts positively towards your score. There's a bunch of banks issuing it these days, but I used orchard bank since they let me sign up online without hassle. If you can get a 2nd card from another bank with a similar program, try it out. Can't hurt and might speed things up a bit.  Open a savings account at a credit union and take a collateral loan against it, and pay it off like a bill every month, like Auto mentioned earlier. Alot of doors and offers will open up once you prove to the union you can pay on time(credit cards, auto loans, lines of credit, etc.). FYI, Cell phone bills, rent, water, electric, gas, paying taxes, etc. do not count towards your credit score. Being delinquent on any of these however, will fuck up your credit. Isn't that lovely? Moving on, Go to (CLEARNET WARNING) annualcreditreport.com and get your credit reports. Also sign up for an online credit checking service, myfico is pretty good, but there are others that are just as fine. Having access online let's you dispute online, which is great. Some agencies let you dispute online, others don't. When you get your credit report, Dispute EVERYTHING negative/incorrect. You can do it in writing via certified mail or online, but after months of doing this, they're prone to human error and will miss their 30-day deadline to respond, and should automatically delete the derogatory entry by law. For me, I did it around holiday season and well into Jan-Feb and beat them at their own game, 3 deletions out of 7. Yeah, I got lucky, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Now, the hard part. Confronting your debtors. They're pretty smart these days and use bots or a 3rd party collection company to contact you due to the ""The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act"", which allowed a consumer to sue a collection agency for $1000 per violation. A man in Texas (Clearnet Warning) made a living off exercising his right and stacked green to cathedral ceilings until they backed off permanently:  http://www.dallasobserver.com/2010-01-21/news/better-off-deadbeat-craig-cunningham-has-a-simple-solution-for-getting-bill-collectors-off-his-back-he-sues-them/ If you call a company you owe money to directly, they'll dump you straight in collection departments/agency hell, who will lie and try to persuade you to pay and push as hard as they can for it. Most companies have a rep to protect and won't dirty their hands with chasing you down for money, so they pay foreigners, offshore companies, collection companies that change names and phones frequently, and all kinds of shady who know whats to blow up your phone/email every week demanding money. (Clearnet Warning) Debtorboards.com are well-versed in offensive tactics you can use vs. collections to beat them in court for $$$ or to simply get them to stop calling. Not a pro in that domain, though I forced all my collectors to contact me in writing only hehe, but there's still money to be made and debts invalidated if you're cunning or ask around on the sites I mentioned earlier.  Point is, you want communications to be with the big shots, the main company you owe money to, not some clowns they hire to shake you down. MyFico forums (clearnet) has backdoor numbers to retention departments, executives, supervisors, and people with real power and decision-making authority that can handle your case alot better than customer support or collections. Another option, you can communicate in writing and send it via certified mail, and ask all your creditors to validate the debt. If they can't do it in 30 days, tell this to all your credit reporting agencies, and by law, they have to delete it and your off the hook.  If to does come back validated, this is where your negotiating skills come in and you gotta sweet talk these people or write good letters. The best outcome you want is a payment for deletion, where basically, if you pay the balance in full, they'll delete the bad record off your credit report forever, or they'll report your entire history with them as current, as if you were never late. The settlement route, where you pay alot less than you owe, is bad and should be used as a last resort, as they are looked at unfavorably by most institutions. Only exception to this would be a settlement, where you pay a percentage of what you owe, and in return, they delete the derogatory history on your report. If you're damn near bankrupt, lawyer up, that's beyond my scope of expertise . I never had to settle, but did talk them into deleting all my late fees and insane interest charges I was getting with 0 penalty. If they make you an offer, like a pay for deletion, settlement with deletion, deletion of extra fees, tickets to see a Backstreet Boys reunion free of charge, etc. MAKE SURE to get it in writing, and request/demand it. This will be your golden ticket out of collections hell with that company and a legal paper trail straight from the company that will protect you.  I hope this points you in the right direction. Good luck man! Do this as many times as needed until your accounts are current.

I'm new to this forum - and to BMR in general.  I recently made my first order, which unfortunately didn't arrive. I've today been contacted by the police, telling me they intercepted a letter to me with 3g of methamphetamine (which wasn't what I ordered, but I guess that's what was sent).  I denied having anything to do with it.  They told me I'm accused of importing illegal drugs and have asked me to come to their office next week and present a list of transactions from my bank - dating three months back.  I will need to check if I'm obliged to to this or not.   But if I have to, the thing is, that I DID transfer money from my account to an online bitcoin vendor. So that will show on the transaction.  I know this won't connect me to buying, but it will of course raise their suspicion.  My question now is what I can/should do not to worsen the case (any ideas/hints will be greatly appreciated)? - and more specifically: I received my money in the MultiBit wallet. Is there any way to erase the transaction history of my wallet so - if it ends there - they can't see what I did with the bitcoins and when (if not, I'll transfer to another wallet and erase).  - are there any wallets that don't show the history of my transactions? I was thinking to pay money to get the exact same amount of bitcoins (this time anonymously) to another wallet so I can show that I still have the bitcoins and hence can't have used for drugs. (The truth is that even before going on BMR I wanted to but bitcoins to support the community (and see if it happened to raise in value).   Thanks in advance",NA

They want you to incriminate yourself. This is their only chance to charge you. You have not been charged, and until u receive a charge in the mail or in person you dont need to worry. Do not meet them, dont greet them. They may apply for a warrant so just clean house and keep laptop locked up tight or at a friends house. Not sure what country your in, but they may be able to get a judge to sign a warrant but Im not 100% sure on this. Best thing u can do is Clean house and keep your mouth shut. If they continue to contact u without charging you, ask them politlely if you are being charged with anything, if theyve not charged u yet, they cant, or wont. And ask them to contact your lawyer with any further questions and to please quit harrassing you. Ive been in a similar situation when my house was broken into on an arrest warrant for a woman who didnt even live there. They found illegals and confiscated them but couldnt prosecute bc they had the wrong house and these things were not on the warrant. They tried a few days to get me to write a statement on myself promising to drop this and that charge which I was never even charged for a thing.. So fuck em.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,toutvabien,16783,2013-12-11T12:31:00,"Re: Help needed: Contacted by the police, what to do?",Safety,"Thanks for the support and help! Highly aprecitated - especially in a moment like this.  My main worry is this: They say I'm accused and will need to show up with bank receipts from the last 4 months. â I will check if this is true, that I HAVE to show up with said information. My sister is a lawyer and many friends are also - I will be able to ask. - BUT, if it IS true that I have to show up - AND show my bank transactions, I have some for bitcoins. I know this doesn't prove anything at all. But I want to make sure, if they were to get a warrant, that the bitcoin history of my wallet can be erased, or if I just transfer what I have to another wallet (somewhere else) and delete the old. - I'm in a Scandinavian country by the way.  I'm not afraid of a warrant for my apartment or computer in general. There's nothing incriminating to be found in the apartment, nor have I used my personal computer for anything. All that communication is safe. But the one - big - mistake is that I transferred money to buy bitcoins from my account (instead of choosing an anonymous way there also).     So what they get, IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT to check my account, and IF I HAVE to show up is a transfer for bitcoins made a few days before the package was intercepted. This would give then enough, I think, to continue an investigation - as it will indeed look suspicious.  So if they KNOW i've bought bitcoins, I might be asked to show the wallet - or the say what I used it for. This is where I was looking to see if there were any ways to cover a story that I bought the bitcoins as a legal currency and have used the legally.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,shortcircuit,16783,2013-12-11T13:39:00,"Re: Help needed: Contacted by the police, what to do?",Safety,"Based of what you are saying you are under investigation. If they asked you to come in next week, then they are attempting to build a case before you get there so they can ambush you with whatever ""evidence"" they have on hand. So take this advice or leave it but it will most likely keep you out of jail. 1. You need an attorney that is not an option any more at this point. They will fill you in to the particular state laws in your region, and your only statement to the police at this point is I want my lawyer and won't answer any questions  without him. Part of the problem with an ongoing investigation is that if you go in and say I spent my btc on pizza and they can verify this is a lie, you've now committed a crime giving them probable cause to get the warrants needed.  2. As far as your laptop, it is now time to yank the hard drive, get a powerful magnet (speaker magnet) and leave it on there for a few hours. Dispose of it somewhere other then your house. Once an item goes into the trash and out to the curb it is considered public property and subject to search without a warrant. If they issue a warrant for the drive, you can't produce what you don't have. If it is magnetically destroyed, it would take a miracle to get anything from it.  3. Consider your address burned and all mail under watch. 4. For whatever reasons the local fuzz got the package which works to your advantage. The feds would have done a controlled delivery, so if your luck holds the feds will not have picked up the investigation. Admit nothing about knowing about sr2 or any other marktets, once again probable cause.  5. Do not, & a I repeat DO NOT talk about any of this on a cell phone. The supreme court has stated that cell phone conversation is not protected like a land line and the fuzz do not need a warrant to listen in. Public air waves and all. Secondly for your sake I hope you haven't been texting, etc about this over your phone to ""friends"". All the major carriers now cooperate with LE and can provide copies of your txt's. (yes your txts) from their central servers which are stored for however many months.  6. Lastly if you have not already done so, clean your house, car, etc. Leave nothing with residue, or have any paraphaneila (sp?)... May not be enough to charge you with but will be enough to get a warrant issued on probable cause.  You've now entered the realm of big brother, and all that shit you see on tv about rights, etc are just that shit. Cops can & will lie to you. Everything you say can & will be held against you to build a case. There is a reason that most states, etc have a 90% conviction rate. Lawyer up, clean house, hope your trail of bread crumbs doesn't come back to bite you in the ass. & I can't emphasize this last part enough. Your friends are now no longer your friends. They will protect their own asses if called in for questioning about your to the cops. Say nothing, Conversation with family & your priest are not confidential. If put under oath or just called in for question most of them will rat you out to save their own ass.",NA

That is all. It is really as easy as it sounds.",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,blendmaker,8957,2013-10-24T12:28:00,Re: [help] How do you blot sheets?,The Classroom,I used to lay 25i on 900 blotter sheets. What you need to do is first ascertain how much liquid your sheet will absorb.  Once you know how much liquid the sheet will absorb you will mix a gram into that solution. Place the sheet in a glass dish that is the same size as your sheet then pour the liquid onto the sheet. spread it around so that it is as even as you can get it on the sheet. Thats the fast explanation.  Im sure someone else could explain it more in depth. One thing that is important to remember is to make sure that when miing the chemical into a solution that the 25i fully disolves.  If it doesn't fully disolve then some of your hits will come out way stronger than others. Such a scenario could be bad in two ways. First some of your hits may not make people trip and they  will want a refund. Bad for business. Second some hits could come out to strong and people may not be able to handle them. That is a safety issue. I have seen many people lose their minds on the substance.  Another option is to make a liquid solution. To do this get a dropper bottle (tasty puff containers work wonders) and fill it with everclear. (if you don't have access to ever clear then strong vodka can work.) Measure how much everclear vial. Then measure how many drops you get out of what you put in the vial. You want to know how many drops you get out of the vial so you can measure how much 25i to dissolve into it. You don't want to use a gram in a vial thats bad news.  I used to get about 20drops per ml in a tastypuff bottle. Meaning that 5ml of liqud would be mixed with 100mg of 25i and then fully dissolved. Once it is fully dissolved it is ready to go. You can put one drop up your nose or you can put a drop in your mouth and trip. When I use to do this I noticed that when dropping it in a persons mouth it worked better to drop it between the gums and front lip. It would absorb in the same way chewing tobacco absorbes as well as the other plus side is it would strart to work with in ten minutes and since its not directly on the tongue you don't have to put up with the awful taste as much. As always never sell it as acid always be truthful as to what the substance is and BE CAREFUL WITH THE SUBSTANCE ITS NOT LIKE ACID. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO SQUIRTING 5 AND TEN DROPS IN SOMEONES MOUTH. LIMIT IT AT ONE TO 3.  AND ONLY GIVE UP TO 3 FOR HEAVILY EXPERIENCED 25I USERS. Good luck to ya.   Also hmu if you are ever in need of Ketamine.,NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,âMathbonusÂ²,7228,2013-09-25T17:45:00,Topic: Bitcoin Mining Tutorial (Newb // Advanced),The Classroom,"Firstoff, a nice steaming plate of copypasta for u. This: http://www.newslobster.com/random/how-to-get-started-using-your-gpu-to-mine-for-bitcoins-on-windows is the original link to where you can read all the fantastic text below plus a little bit more. I thought it would be moar useful here though, so enjoy!Note: this deals with software setup and not hardware. Too Long; Didn't Read / Easy and somewhat automated version: 1. Go to www.bitcoin.org, download and install the most recent version of bitcoin (the default file path should be fine). 2. A GUI-based tool exists here which will help to speed this up and will automate a lot of the setup steps. Go to the linked forum thread, download and extract the archive somewhere, and then run guiminer.exe. 3. From the GUIMiner interface, click solo utilities â set bitcoin client path. Point the dialog box to bitcoin.exe; likely located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe or C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe. Next click solo utilities â create solo password. Pick anything arbitrary for username and password but remember it, as you will need to use this later. Then finally you want to click solo utilities â launch bitcoin client as server. This will launch bitcoin ready to be mined with, you must first wait for all the blocks to be downloaded before you can start to mine, and this may take several hours; you can view the current block count here. 4. Once all the blocks are downloaded, select solo from the server drop down box, then enter the username and password that you used before, then click start mining. Congratulations, you are now mining for bitcoins (Recommended) 5. Since the difficulty is high now, you will only likely see an immediate return if you mine as part of a pool. The GUI Miner will greatly expedite pool setup and you can find some more information about pools here. Additional notes: As best I can tell the GUI Miner works best for a single graphics card, you may need to follow the long version of the guide below if you wish to mine with SLI/Crossfire and use more than one graphics card simultaneously. The GUI Miner also does not display the actual console window of poclbm or whatever miner you may be using; this may be desirable for some people.     Long, manual set up version using batch scripts and the command prompt: Please note that the long version of this guide will show you how to do everything manually and via the command line. This is somewhat advanced and only recommended if you are comfortable manually creating/editing text files and using the command prompt. 1. To start, head over to http://www.bitcoin.org/ and download the latest windows client (it appears that only an exe installer is offered now). Install it to wherever you want, but it may be of benefit to keep the directory path somewhat simple, because batch scripts and launching from the command line will follow. For argument's sake, I will just assume you are using the default install path on the 64-bit version of windows, so your install directory may be: C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin At the time of writing, the latest version of bitcoin is 0.3.23, and your overall path to bitcoin.exe should be: C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe To start, open up a command prompt (windows key + r â type cmd â hit enter), and then navigate to the directory where bitcoin.exe is located. If you've been following along with my examples, you will want to type this into the command prompt window: cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin 2. Put the command prompt aside for just a second, because before launching bitcoin, you will need to create a text file called bitcoin.conf (the location of this file will vary depending on which version of Windows you are using) If you are using Windows 7 or Vista, navigate to:C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin If you are using Windows XP, navigate to:C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Bitcoin (You will probably need to create the ""Bitcoin"" directory, as bitcoin.exe will auto-create it on first run, but you haven't yet run itâ¦ This is also where showing hidden folders comes into play, because on Windows 7 the AppData directory is hidden; Application Data may be hidden on XP as well) Inside the appropriate folder, just right click and select newâtext document, then rename this file to bitcoin.conf Once you have created this file, open it up with your favorite text editor and add the following 2 lines (don't forget to save it when finished): rpcuser=youruserrpcpassword=yourpw Where youruser and yourpw should be any arbitrary username and password; this is supplied to the miner later on via command line so that the miners can communicate with bitcoin.exe (these are the values that bitcoin expects, if the miner specifies different values at launch you will likely get RPC errors). 3. Next, you want to start bitcoin.exe with the '-server' argument specified. This tells bitcoin that there will be external programs running and allows bitcoin to communicate with them. To do so, bring your command prompt back into focus and type: bitcoin.exe -server (alternatively you can just launch bitcoind.exe from the \daemon directory, which is the GUI-less client, but I prefer to use the GUI client. Using bitcoind.exe is equivalent to launching bitcoin.exe with the arguments -server -daemon specified) Now you will see bitcoin start up for the first time. Your client must first download the block chain before you will be able to start generating coins, and this is done automatically on first startup. You will see the number of blocks begin to increase over time, and at the time of writing there are 130,805 blocks (you can view the current block count here). This can take several hours so be patient and let it do its thing. This process can be sped up if you forward port 8333 TCP on your router, but this is not required. 4. Next, head on over to this thread and download the latest poclbm_py2exe binary from the first post. There are other miners available which work in windows, but m0mchil's is the one that I use and this guide will instruct how to set up this particular miner. (poclbm stands for (I believeâ¦) PyOpenCL Bitcoin Miner) If you have been following along so far, I would suggest that you create a new directory inside C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin to reflect the latest version of the windows binary. At the time of writing the most recent version is poclbm_py2exe_20110709, so you should create a new directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709 and then extract the contents of the archive to this new folder. The executable which will be used is poclbm.exe, but this must be launched via command line and given several launch parameters. This can be tedious to do on windows, so we will expedite this with a batch script. (and your final path to poclbm.exe should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709\poclbm.exe) 5. You can place the batch script anywhere you like; I put mine on my desktop for easy access. Right click again and create a new text file, then rename it to whatever_you_want.bat, all that matters here is the .bat extension. Right click on this file and hit edit (double clicking on it will launch it). In this batch file you want to put the following contents (this is assuming you're following the convention of this guide so far - if you are using your own directory structure, then use whatever location you have chosen instead): start /D""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709"" poclbm.exe youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=0(Similarly, for using a pool you can do something like this: start /D""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709"" poclbm.exe http://poolworker.1ool_pw1@api2.bitcoin.cz:8332 --device=0 ) ***(Important Note: Some people have been having issues with the batch script failing to launch initially. It seems that it may be important to specify your device number along with the rest of the launch parameters on each line of the batch script. This can be done by simply specifying --device=X, where X is the number of your desired video device; most likely 0. If you have multiple devices, then the 2nd device is likely ""1"", and so on; if you are using onboard video I am not sure how this would workâ¦please see the forum thread linked here.)*** ""start"" just tells the batch script to start a new process in its own window, the /D parameter specifies the directory that the program is located in (this allows the batch script to be launched from anywhere on your computer), and then poclbm.exe is just the target program, followed by the arguments it needs to run properly. Make sure to use the same user and password that you specified earlier in your bitcoin.conf file. Quotes are needed whenever paths have a space in them. Now all that's left to do is save this file and wait until bitcoin finishes downloading all the blocks; you cannot generate until you have acquired all blocks.(You may end up waiting a long time for this to finish, so if you want to take some time to go read more about bitcoins and how the system works, now is a good time ) Once all blocks have been acquired, make sure bitcoin is running with the -server switch, then simply double click on your batch file. A new window should pop up and after a few seconds. If all is going well, your hashrate will be displayed. When you want to exit just ""x"" out of the window or press ctrl-c. You can make a batch script to launch bitcoin.exe with the -server argument as well, its contents should look something like this:start /D""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin"" bitcoin.exe -server If you have more than one graphics card, you can use them both at the same time by doing something similar to this within your batch file: start /D""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709"" poclbm.exe youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=0start /D""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709"" poclbm.exe youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=1 for however many devices you use. This will open up a new window for each graphics card and show each card's hashrate. Another switch you may want to play around with is the -w switch, which indicates the worksize for your card to use; for example: start /D""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709"" youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=0 -w 256 By default, m0mchil's miner will use the maximum work size supported by your card, most likely 256 or 512. You can play around with different sizes to see which gives you the highest hashrate; the size must be a power of 2. You will know if you have exceeded your card's maximum size if the miner errors or crashes when you try to start itI use nvidia GTX275s, my maximum work size is 512 but I seem to get the best hashrate with 256. Going too small will greatly lower your hashrate and could possibly be used as a way to throttle power usage (I have only tested the effects of worksize on hashrate and not on power consumption or core temperature) You can also play around with the -v argument, but with my NVIDIA cards this seems to make poclbm.exe crash after a few seconds. Something which was changed in recent versions seems to make the miner more aggressive with GPU resources. If you notice your desktop is being sluggish you can mitigate this by adding: -f 60 to the end of each line of your batch script. I'm not sure what exactly this does, but for a small cost in hashrate (maybe 1-2mhash, if that) your desktop will be much more responsive while mining for bitcoins.   Assuming you have gotten this far and everything works, you can add the totals of each individual hashrate from your GPU(s), and put the grand total into this calculator to get an idea of how much you can earn daily (if you use a pool). If you are mining solo assume that the expected average time to generate a block is easily 4-8 weeks or much longer (but this will get you 50BTC). Now all you have to do is wait Note that it will likely take many weeks to generate coins, and you are likely to notice an increase in your power bill while you run your bitcoin miners (Please Note: if you are not using high-end hardware, it is conceivable that you may spend more on power than you can recoup via bitcoin generation and sales for solo mining). Additionally, you may want to look into doing something like this with RivaTuner or a similar app to mitigate the temperature increase on your graphics device(s). (I think that rivatuner also works with newer amd/ati cards)UPDATE: If you are using slow-ish hardware, take a look at the pooled mining option here. (New article on how to use m0mchil's miner with slush's pool)   Troubleshooting: It seems that some people are having issues where the batch script just pops up for a second and then closes without anything happening. This usually indicates that whatever you are trying to launch is failing and quickly prints out an error message on the console window opened by the batch script, but since it fails immediately it closes too quickly for you to read it. In order to determine what the problem is, you will need to navigate to the location of poclbm.exe within a new command prompt; just use cd as is described somewhat in step 1. Once you are in the directory where poclbm.exe is located, you should now try to launch poclbm.exe with the arguments exactly as they are contained in the batch script. So assuming you have been following the conventions of this guide so far, and your batch script fails to start the miner successfully, you would type the following once you are in the directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709: poclbm.exe youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=0 This is just how you would normally launch the miner anyway, the batch script simply does this for you when you double click on it. By entering this manually from within an already-open command prompt, if the miner fails to launch, the error messages will be printed to the console and will remain there for you to read. This should give you the specific problem that is preventing your miner from launching, and allow you to provide a more specific error message than ""it doesn't open""  Alsoâ¦please read all of the comments before making a new one asking for help, it is possible that your problem may have already been covered.   Once you do finally generate some coins, you can head on over to www.mtgox.com and create an account. You can now deposit some bitcoins into your account and get trading (there are other exchange sites but mtgox seems to be the most popular at the moment). There are ways to sell your mtgox dollars for paypal dollars, and more information can be obtained by talking with the folks in #bitcoin-otc on irc.freenode.net. Alternatively people will often be willing to purchase bitcoins directly from you for paypal or other methods of currency exchange. IMPORTANT NOTE: Paypal does NOT like bitcoin, you SHOULD NOT mention bitcoins at all in any correspondence with paypal, nor should you mention it at all when transferring money!!! If you intend to stick with this and help the bitcoin community grow you should also make a forum account on the bitcoin site as well as join the irc channels #bitcoin, #bitcoin-market, and #bitcoin-otc, all on freenode.   I hope that this tutorial helps, and it is only intended to be an introduction to getting a ""no frills"" miner setup working under windows. I decided to write this after seeing some people seemingly give up after not being able to figure out how to get everything set up correctly.This tutorial is mainly a guide for setting up m0mchil's python-based miner. There are other miners which work under windows, DiabloD3's for example - but his is based on java and you will need to launch it differently. Here is another miner which is developed and maintained by puddinpop. On a somewhat unrelated note, I've been getting a lot of questions like ""OMG is this legal!?"". As far as I know, mining for bitcoins is 100% legal.",NA

It is a lot of computational work being done by a processing unit (ideally the GPU, can be the CPU or even an ASIC if you have one) in order to solve the next block and keep the block chain progressing.

I notice some people are selling guides on how to make chemicals, do not expect to make MDMA yourself from research papers someone has sent you (ie madmaxuk) as this will most likely not work. The chemists who make these compounds have YEARS of experience and the right tools to make the chemicals. If you really must make some chemicals, start out with easy stuff to get the feel for it. I have done chemical synthesis in graduate school, it is not as easy as the paper makes it sound, you do not have access to a lab and the equipment to know what you make.  If you feel like you can make chemicals on your own, please google ""frozen junkies"" and see what one mistake can do. The man responsible was a chemistry graduate student, not some kitchen chemist. He thought he had a 'pure-enough' compound, nothing is 'pure-enough' until you make sure it is pure through NMR or MS/GC.  I have made things before outside of my lab, but only after making them in the lab and making sure my procedure produced pure chemicals, only then did I trust my product enough to use and to sell to others. I hope this helps some people from wasting thousands of dollars on equipment because they have some 'guide' on how to make a compound.   -Duke",NA

The most important thing is knowing what you need to do and when. Maybe you can skip purifying an intermediary and get a higher yield by purifying at the end.

Access to chems is another thing, surprisingly some hardware solvents are very clean and can be used for intermediate steps.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,narkodilur,4758,2013-06-20T13:46:00,Re: Chemistry Synthesis (from a chemist),The Classroom,"you can only skip purification if the next reaction step uses cheap reagents that are unselective, for example, the isomerisation of safrole to isosafrole, or the hydrolysis of a crude lysergic acid containing base material. but in general you are better off having near analytical grade results after each reaction stage. certainly when it comes to reductions and extractions, impurities, as for example as i said, polar substances for acid/base extractions (this is the reason for drying) or like with pseudophedrine pills that are (as is now very common) laced with PEG, polysorbate, or other similar evil toxic carcinogenic 'tabletting agents', avoiding heat and water. again the same thing. the difference in result is dramatic. purity is your friend in the lab. there may be plenty of stupid people out there who might think 'ooh, this chemistry thing is a money spinner' and will very quickly hit a brick wall because they lack the intellect required to do it. suffice it to say that anyone under about 110IQ will not be able to cope with doing chemistry, at least, not when they have to cope with a supply problem, such as a change in pill formula, a loss of a source of a good reagent or solvent, or other such difficulties. the lesser brains in the business get by with a little bit of social skills, and successful development of a network of multiple fallbacks for support. but ultimately, only people who could get through 3 years of O-Chem can really do much more than acid base extraction as a business... long term.",NA

Either way, knowledge is meant to be used.  Good luck and have fun. /disclaimer To start off, let me say that all of this information is probably already here on the forum. I've done a lot of extensive searching here on the forum, and have found a lot of great information. But there is no definitive guide for dummies that doesn't already assume you know something about being anonymous. Which is fair. If you make it here, you should already have some knowledge. Still, whenever I do research on the forum, I always seem to be missing a puzzle piece, which is rather irritating. So I'm going to put everything I know about using BTC safely in this thread, and hope my superior comrades will chime in to correct, add to, and answer any questions. What this guide will assume: You know what Bitcoin is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now let's start at the beginning. You've decided you want to purchase illegal products and services using BTC. So where do you go to get bitcoins? These are your options: -A clearnet bitcoin vendor, like bitstamp or mtgox Pros Most competitive BTC to <insert fiat currency> exchange rateVerified, instantaneous transfers. You will not get scammed Cons Not anonymous. In order to purchase BTC, you'll need to submit some form of personal information. PayPal, Credit Card, Bank account, etc. Bottom line: Purchasing BTC is perfectly legal. Like any currency, you only get in trouble when you choose to buy something illegal with it. If you want to buy a $1000 worth of drugs, and you exchange $1000 to BTC to make that happen...you're safe. All you've done at this point is buy BTC. This is neither suspicious, nor illegal. You haven't crossed the line yet. Here is my word of caution, though: A lot of criminals aren't just caught with one glaring error in security. It's a lot of little missteps that build over time. The transition from the circumstantial to the verifiable. So if you know, or suspect, that you want to engage in a life of crime, then do not buy BTC this way. Why? As soon as you make a BTC purchase using your personal account, that purchase exists forever. Fifty years later, LE can say ""and this is when he started"". By itself, it's totally harmless. But if you can avoid giving ANY information to the authorities, then I humbly submit that you should do so.  -The second way to buy BTC is through a friend ProsCan pay in cash, which aids anonymity ConsYou know someone who can identitfy the fact that you now how have assets in BTC.  Bottom Line: Again, is this feasibly dangerous? No. Should you still do it? No. Consider this practice. Always behave as if one teeny tiny misstep will end you. Get into the discipline of being detailed and discreet now, and it will save your life later. Do not create an unnecessary connection.  -Purchase off of localbitcoin Pros Variety of payment methodsPerfect anonymity if used correctly ConsMust be used correctly to be completely effectiveExchange rates may not be in your favor. This site exists for people who make a profit by flipping, or scalping. You will not receive a one to one exchange. Look up the current exchange rate before you sign on, and minimize the cost as much as you can.  Bottom Line: Localbitcoins is the perfect solution, if you're careful. Don't purchase BTC using anything with your name on it. That means no PayPal, no Western Union, nothing that remotely involves anything but cash. Don't give your real name, email, or phone number to anyone. Why? What if the dealer you bought BTC from is under investigation by the authorities? By leaving a traceable trail with a sloppy purchase, you are now a known associate. Is this bad? Not right now. You haven't done anything illegal. You just bought BTC. But your name is now in some file somewhere. So later down the road, when you decide to become the next Frank Lucas, or Corleone, that shred of information is there. Inscribe this onto your soul: Don't take any risk you can avoid. The most valuable currency in the criminal world is information. Don't give anything away that you don't need to.  I repeat: The Darkweb Code Don't take any risk you can avoid.The most valuable currency in the criminal world is information.Don't give anything away that you don't need to.  So how to buy bitcoins in the safest way possible? Meet the vendor, and pay in cash. Do not agree to meet with a vendor that does not have an established record of positive feedback. Meet in a public place with good Wi-Fi, where you can verify the exchange.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now you have BTC stored in a wallet of some sort. Normal people should have at least two wallets: An active, or ""hot"" wallet. This a wallet that is stored on a web server, or a computer with an active connection to the internet. Use this for purchases and receipt. The second wallet is your ""cold storage"" wallet. To be kept backed up a USB drive with several redundancies. If you choose to keep BTC, this is where they go when they aren't being used. Refer to this guide for further details: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_set_up_a_secure_offline_savings_wallet Now, for the innocent BTC spender, security precautions stop there. We solemnly swear that we are up to no good.   There are three  kinds of people that are active on BMR and similar sites: 1. Those who spend BTC for goods and services -- BTC flows one way; out of your wallet and away from you.2. Those who profit in the form of BTC -- coins flow at least one way; from the external environment to your wallet. Obviously you can buy and sell, and have coins flowing both ways.3. LE, who masquerades as buyer and/seller Now as I understand it, BTC is highly traceable by default. Every transaction in existence is recorded on a public ledger of sorts, called the blockchain. This is comprised of three components: Two addresses and an amount. For example: We have Bob and John. Bob's wallet generates an address: 11111John's wallet generates an address: 22222 Bob wants to send John 1 BTC. So that amount goes from 11111 to 22222 and is recorded on the blockchain. And that's it. So now you ask, if Bob sends John 1 BTC for drugs, how does Bob get caught? Okay. I THINK I know how this works, but I'd like someone who actually knows to chime in here, step by step. So I have questions: 1) John gets caught because his address is associated with some profile, or piece of info that compromises his anonymity, right?2) PC wallets like multibit can generate new addresses. Is this safe? Do these addresses contain information that can be used to find you? MAC addresses, or some such tom foolery? 3) If I send one payment via one address, then use the same wallet to generate a new address and send a new payment, can these two transactions be linked to the same wallet?",NA

Use bitfog or other tumbling services and the chain is broken. There is nothing wrong with buying from a service that has your identity. Run them through a tumbler and the trail ends there.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,17063,2013-12-14T19:39:00,Re: The Essential Guide To Understanding Bitcoin Safety (WIP),Safety,"Thanks for chiming in Organix! You make a good point. Actually, I know about tumbling, and both tumblers you mentioned. I haven't ignored them, I just haven't gotten to that point in the guide yet. I think it's important to explain the system as it was originally intended to function before saying ""and this is why you need to use a service like fog and pay 3% of your balance"".  The point of this guide is to provide an explanation that is comprehensive, without being needlessly complex. This way, other members aren't running helter skelter trying to find answers to their questions on a dozen different clearweb sites. In short, I want the guide to say: ""This is the working theory you should understand. This is why you should do X, and it keeps you from Y and so forth.  Tumblers, and tumbling will have its own section a bit later. I'd like to get the answers to those questions before moving to that point.",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,17063,2013-12-14T19:49:00,Re: The Essential Guide To Understanding Bitcoin Safety (WIP),Safety,"Oh, and you're also right about buying from a service that records your identity, when you choose a tumbler. That's not the point I'm trying to make, though. As I stated earlier the guide, it's written with the concept that the best solution is the one where you can avoid giving any information at all. Like buying from localbitcoins and paying in cash, as opposed to buying from a service.  I'm writing this from the standpoint that the best defense is a careful and deliberate adherence to complete anonymity, or as close as you can get to it. Whether readers want to do it that way or not is up to them, but I'd like to provide the option. It's about creating that methodology from the very beginning; choosing to be as clandestine as possible, as opposed to doing it after the fact. If this mentality starts at the beginning, then there's less of a chance for stupid mistakes later. That's my reasoning, anyway. This guide will capitalize on the most anonymous way to do something, as opposed to the most efficient. Thanks again for chiming in Organix, I'm going to put that disclaimer at the top of the guide.",NA

There are several possibilities to explore:     Make sure that you are using the most recent password you know.    Try combinations - change one character at a time to upper- or lowercase, swap characters, add a ! to the end and so on    Examine the rolling wallet backups, and apply the same process.    Examine the automatic private key exports - these are encrypted with your wallet password when they are generated As a last resort go to a quiet room and relax. Think about where you might have put a copy of the password. Perhaps one of the following:     Hidden file somewhere?    USB drive?    Encrypted copy held on LastPass or KeyPass? You should be using a secure password generator with 14 or more random characters.    Accidental copy on a local backup service like Time Machine or rsync?    An intentional encrypted copy on Dropbox or GDrive?    Maybe you wrote it down and put it in a book, or an old drawer?    Does a trusted friend or relative have a copy? If you have really, truly lost or forgotten your password and you only have encrypted wallets, then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin.

It doesn't get much better than that.  As I said, Tails is good, GPG4USB is good, GnuPT (Gnu Privacy Tray) is also good. GPGSuite (formerly GPGTools) is great for the Mac.  If you think I don't know what I'm talking about, generate a new key with Kleopatra, and compare it with a key that you generate with GPG4USB, as an example. You can see the difference, if you go into Terminal mode (Linux/Mac OS X) or use the Command Prompt (Windows).  Just use gpg --list-keys and you'll see the difference. You'll see that keys generated by Kleopatra have NO encryption sub-key, whereas keys generated by GPG4USB have an encryption sub-key.  The Hooded Man",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,12339,2013-11-08T22:18:00,Re: police scanners and physical crime,Safety,"Well, there are ways to track what emergency services are doing.  In the netherlands (and many european countries) the police have implemented encrypted trunked radio systems (TETRA, P2000, ASTRID and such) that make it impossible to listen to the content of conversations unless you can break the encryption. This encryption has not been broken to my knowledge, and it could be comparable to GSM's A5/1 in strength or even better (the algorithms are secret).  However, devices have been developed that detect transmissions from mobile police (and fire/ambulance) devices that are able to give you some idea what is going on. In their simplest form they simply detect the signal with a strength indication so you can tell how far apart it roughly is. Solutions with triangulation or doppler are also possible giving you a more exact idea of where a mobile unit is. In the netherlands intercepting these signals without decrypting their content is perfectly legal.  One advantage to those keeping an eye on the police is that these digital systems also transmit intermittent signals even if they are not actively used to speak, just like cellphones do.  Banning radar speed trap detectors has been quite an ordeal here as well: The european human rights treaty guarantees freedom to receive information, and usually outweighs any other legislation. In the case of radar detectors legislation was constructed to forbid the use and sale of units that are specifically designed to be mounted in vehicles, and only alert the presence of a signal. If i want to, i could perfectly use a receiver in my house or yard to monitor signals in the bands used for speed traps.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,12339,2013-11-09T22:35:00,Re: police scanners and physical crime,Safety,"Best to check out C2000 on wikipedia for full details.  Bascially C2000 is a digital communications system used by emergency services that is encrypted somewhat like GSM is, but it also allows for direct device-to-device connections which GSM phones do not.  P2000 is a pager network that is not encrypted at all. It also operates at a completely different frequency (~176 MHz) than C2000 (~450 MHz) These systems are technically unrelated, but were introduced simultaneously so people often confuse them. P2000 messages are easily decoded in software - they are not encrypted, the decoding is solely a means of transforming the RF signal to bits/bytes, there are no keys/ciphers etc involved.  C2000 is encrypted, however. The algorithm is not public, and several exist. You can easily 'see' these transmissions on a spectrum analyser connected to an antenna, but decoding their content is not feasible at this time.",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,TEKST,12339,2013-11-11T15:39:00,Re: police scanners and physical crime,Safety,"Way back when, I lived in a place with unencrypted police radio traffic. That changed a few years back, along with the introduction of MDTs. The way the protocol worked on these was a bad man's gold mine.  You got to learn when they'd 'vest up', heard licence numbers, address, DOB, people's records, car registration numbers, etc. Add to that helpful information that tactical intelligence you can develop and its golden. You learn their response protocols in addition to response times. For example, when they will or will not go into certain places, do the need to wait for a second car, when they'll bring in the tracking dogs. You can learn by consensus if there is a a rule about certain companies getting a direct police patrol response rather than just security guards going out. You could check different patrol companies' protocols, and see if your methods for disabling the systems (trash the telephone line if its not a continuous polling system) drew attention - will they send a guard out to check for break and enter before sending the cops or will the cops be called immediately? I know of guys who used to hit bank jobs using scanners (one over the tellers' counter, one doing crowd control, third man in the car with a scanner and radio link to the crowd control guy) and get a nice, helpful ETA update direct from despatch.

Those are A5/1 encrypted too though, and very hard to break without cooperation from the phone company.  Another issue is working C2000 handsets going 'missing' without anyone reporting them stolen. Missing handsets can easily be locked out of the system if they are known to be compromised, but as long as nobody knows they will keep working and can be used as a listening device.

There was a bit of concern when it came out but Pentium dominates the market. AMD for some reason not as popular. I often wonder about onion on regular web as opposed to Tor. That's clearnet proxied right? Which has the same kind of user information relay as you're talking about with Windows 7. Is it safe to use? coz Tor is downright slow.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Bullionaire,16196,2013-12-05T18:51:00,Re: Methods to stop Police helicopters picking up infared light from grows,Safety,"Greners has foil insulation, I think its called IR Block. Blocks like 98% of radient heat I think. Here is the best way to keep your grow undetectable from IR. You need to build a room inside a room. Use 2x4's and plywood to build this room. Also if possible you need to have the room raised up off of the original floor so you can see underneath it. Insulate the hell outta the inside of the ""built room"" with regular insulation batting. Cover with plywood.  Cover the outside of the built room with the foil IR block insulation, dont go cheap either get the good stuff. Your freedom depends on it. Next cover the walls of the original room with the IR block foil. Then you need to make sure the space between the built wall and the original wall are WELL airconditioned. This creates a gap of cool air 360 degrees around your grow. As far as venting if you can afford it I would seal up the grow and use co2. Your going to need lots of air conditioning power for the built grow room to keep it cool depending on how many lights your running. Lots of work but totally worth it to not walk around all day in an orange jumpsuit. Hope this helps buddy!  Bullionaire",NA

Having a warm room or roof is proof of nothing illegal. They do not start investigations based on ir. They get a tip, get a warrant to use it and then say the garage was very warm and is suspicious and try to snow a judge into giving a general search warrant.  Your best bet is to keep your mouth shut, don't show anyone and don't tell anyone. Use ozone to keep odor down and vent into the attic if you can.",NA

However it might make them start watching you. In the US the supreme court rulled       (Kyllo v. United States) that a search warrant must be issued to use IR detection on a house and use that as evidence. BUT there is nothing keeping them from flying around with FLIR looking for high heat signatures. If they find what they think is a growhouse due to using IR detection and they didnt have a warrant then the heat signature cant be used as evidence in a case OR to obtain a warrant for the inside. But they can still use it to their advantage. If you think they dont use IR to find potential grows you are lying to yourself.",NA

What is the different between having a space heater and a grow op? None, according to the readout from flir. Besides that, you can use ac in the room and the walls and roof will not read hot. Any heated house will show warm spots and warm overall.  What would the cops do it they did an unauthorized fly over and see a bunch of warm roofs or walls? They can't use that info so maybe have a cop go by and see if he spots anything suspicious?

All Im saying is I used to work with a guy who flew helicopters for the DEA. Trust me when I say a growhouse sticks out like a sore dick.  And the difference between a space heater and a good size grow is tens of thousands of btu's. And you are correct about the cooling. If you run a closed grow and have plenty of cooling you will be fine. But too many people try to take the cheap route and just exhaust the heat to the outside. Shit looks like a flamethrower coming out of the side of the house. All Im saying is dont get a false sense of security because of laws or capabilities of flir. DEA plays dirty and will use any trick in the book to get you. Like find a possible grow using flir and when it goes to court instead of admitting to using flir without a warrant they just say they got a tip from a confidential informant. Dont expect them to play by the rules is all Im saying.....,NA

( i tried it ith an added eighth of skunk once - worked very well but it ruined the taste - and made the bathroom smell like weed when I took a s**t) so- melt 400g of dark chocolate and 280g of butter (this could be your 'bud butter') - i do it on the stove but you have to be careful not to let it burn - a bain marie is a simple way to avoid this, especially if you're already baked..-add 400g of light brown sugar-add 6 eggs directly to the mix, and stir in with a wooden spoon/spatula-add 170g of plain flour - make sure everything is combined well place mixture in a suitable oven proof dish lined with baking paper, put in the oven about 170 celcius and cook until ready!! (I won't give you a cooking time because this depends so much on the size and shape of the dish you cook it in - I would advise not to have one too deep as the idea is that when it's done it's still a bit gooey in the middle; therefore in too deep a dish the inside will be pretty much raw still and the outside well overcooked) They are beautiful served hot or really really good ifyou wait it to cool and refrigerate - so long as it's not too well cooked you will have a beautiful marble like effect from the melted gooey chocolate!!!

I immediately writ on the package ""Return to sender"", ""Did Not order this"".I stick back in the mailbox, and put up the flag. I pick it up about 6 hours later when it gets dark.Alternately, I call my neighbor and tell him that I'm out of town and ask if he would pick up my mail for me.(if my neighbor gets busted, I simply deny everything and tell the cops that he must have been using my address to get his drugs.)

(ie boot menu, select usb etc etc) from there be ready to create a VERY important password. this is a password you cant fuck up, ever. memorize it and make it as difficult as you can possibly tolerate. for passwords that i cant use KeePass on, i use complete sentences and replace all characters that look like numbers WITH (ie E = 3, I= , LEET = 1337 etc etc) numbers and i make sure to include grammar marks likes comma's, white spaces, and question marks. there is no way RNG/bruteforce will guess a long sentence, with numbers, and special characters. just make sure its long enough. or use whatever but if LE gets your shit, that password is DEF your weakest link. make sure you select the option for ""more options"" as youll need that for updating/modifying the Tails system. keep a few things in mind, this is not a full tutorial, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!!! they are very thorough, but you have to earn it. Tails is amnesiac, which means anything you do will be erased everytime. including downloading plugins, modifying files, damn near anything outside of saving a file to persistence is gone. every single reboot. sounds great but it can be a pain. try and get Torchat working with pidgin or Claws working with a LOT of email carriers. it just sint going to happen. one more thing, Tails is a linux distro, if youve never used linux before, its not windows. far from it so a lot of what you ""know"" wont work but a lot does as well. ie drag n drop, right clicking shit etc etc hope this helped you and anyone else needing assitance with Tails",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,blackwhitecheck,16025,2013-12-04T21:45:00,Re: HCL bubbling problems ($150 reward for help),The Classroom,"So you want to do an acid/base filtration and recrystallization. I apologize if any of this is too layman-ish, I don't know how much chemistry you know.  Before adding your acid, I suggest washing your solution with water to get rid of contaminants and excess lye. The freebase is dissolved in the toluene layer and is safe from the water. Some shit you don't want is in the water layer. This will help your end weigh, and also reduce the amount of HCl you use. On that note:  Perhaps try using hydrochloric acid instead of Fester's H2SO4 technique. It's called muriatic acid, you can buy it without red flags, and it is safer than using sulfuric acid. If you go this route, add HCl until your solution is barely more basic than neutral- let's say 7.5. Then you have to filter/dry, which takes awhile, but has a lot less potential to mess things up. Honestly, I'd rather do it this way. It's not as fast, it may introduce some contaminants, but the hassle saved by not having to bubble HCl gas through your solution is worth it, imo, until you get your technique sharp in the other areas of the process. I also feel like dealing with gaseous species without a proper fume hood is a terrible idea, and would rather keep that shit in the lab wherever possible. If you decide to gas it anyway- To really make sure you are getting your solute to precipitate fully, make sure it cools down gradually (I would refrigerate it after it reaches room temp). I'm not sure if you really want to put it in an ice bath, because that could cause something called coprecipitation (example: excess lye within the crystal lattice of the amphetamine salt due to rapid crystal formation, among other things). Taking your time here may end up saving you a wash.  If you are planning on synthesizing your own, pay attention to/learn the stoichiometric principles behind what you're doing, and invest in a .001g scale. You can use the molar ratios of your limiting reagents to roughly estimate the % weight of drug in your end product, which will give you a measure of yield. Also, remember that the steps you take to maintain purity along the way (i.e. washing your freebase/toluene solution, not rushing your precipitate) will reduce the loss you will experience through rewashing your product, loss through your product's molecular adhesion to contaminants, etc.   Recrystallization is something for another post- for now, the first conversion should be the focus. Also, please research what I'm telling you, because I don't want you to end up hurting yourself or ruining your drugs because I forgot to include something.Good luck.    p.s.: Never forget to wash your hands before you go to the bathroom after dealing with strong acids and strong bases.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,pnorton,13098,2013-11-21T15:22:00,Re: Socks,Safety,"There is some confusion here, I think.""socks4/5"" is a protocol, that's used by general purpose proxies.You probably know http-proxies, most companies have those, for security and/or performance.Socks is more general in that it works on a lower layer and thus is not protocol (like HTTP) specific.So socks itself is not anything only ""bad"" guys use  vip72.com or similar sites do offer socks proxies that can be used to make you appear to come from IP B while actually your IP is A. BUT be careful, they do know where you came from. So if they are compromised (and even if they do not keep logs, from the moment they are compromised, they will  ) the connection from your IP A to the target IP C is clear. The traffic itself may or may not be, depends on the protocol you are using (http vs https, etc.) . You can of course do the same by just using tor (that is, appearing to be from B, where B is an exit node). The problem with that and carding is, that a lot of sites do screen for traffic from tor exit nodes and either block the access, or block your account/cards/etc. because of this traffic.That is why many use services like vip72.com where the ""exit nodes"" are not as static as with tor and probably not blocked, and, as a poster mentioned above, you can also (you can do that with tor, too) select proxies by country, which might be needed for some sites.Using tor is certainly safer, in terms of you not being able to be traced, but in some cases you need to use other proxies.The best way then is to chain the proxy after your tor connection, i.e. connect to the proxy via tor.That of course requires some research, but you really should spend the time to do it, some five-minute tutorial will only give you a false sense of security. If you do NOT want to spend the time on research, at least use some public wifi, but only once and only for a short time, and wear some kind of disguise in case you are not absolutely sure that there are no cameras (and, of course, do not pay with personalized (that is, yours) creditcards etc ) )",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,jewelsandothers,4031,2013-04-06T20:02:00,Topic: ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dihydrogen Monoxide OUT BREAK,The Classroom,"Dihydrogen Monoxide - The TruthThe Truth about DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDEDihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is perhaps the single most prevalent of all chemicals that can be dangerous to human life. Despite this truth, most people are not unduly concerned about the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide. Governments, civic leaders, corporations, military organizations, and citizens in every walk of life seem to either be ignorant of or shrug off the truth about Dihydrogen Monoxide as not being applicable to them. This concerns us.Spreading the Truth about Dihydrogen MonoxideIn 1997, the Dihydrogen Monoxide Research Division was formed and went online spreading the truth about DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE. As word has spread, so too has the public awareness of Dihydrogen Monoxide and its implications involving the Internet and accessibility of such information. To that end, the DMRD's web site at DHMO.org continues to provide the most comprehensive collection of Dihydrogen Monoxide information available anywhere. Common Dihydrogen Monoxide Scare TacticsUnfortunately, some have seen fit to fill many thousands of web pages with purposely slanted propaganda meant more to titillate and sensationalize than to inform. The following ""information"" about Dihydrogen Monoxide is what you'll commonly find on the Internet. The Dihydrogen Monoxide Research Division does not endorse the use of such scare tactics, particularly when telling people about the invisible killer, Dihydrogen Monoxide. ""Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide"" written by the Coalition to Ban DHMO Â© 1988 BAN DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE - THE INVISIBLE KILLER!Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year.What are the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide?Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.Dihydrogen Monoxide FactsDihydrogen monoxide:     is also known as hydric acid, and is the major component of acid rain.    contributes to the Greenhouse Effect.    may cause severe burns.    contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.    accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.    may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.    has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.  Dihydrogen Monoxide AlertsContamination is reaching epidemic proportions! Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. In the midwest alone DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property damage.Dihydrogen Monoxide UsesDespite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:     as an industrial solvent and coolant.    in nuclear power plants.    in the production of styrofoam.    as a fire retardant.    in many forms of cruel animal research.    in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.    as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products.  Stop the horror - Ban Dihydrogen MonoxideCompanies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer! THE HORROR MUST BE STOPPED! The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its importance to the economic health of this nation. In fact, the navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use. IT'S NOT TOO LATE! Act NOW to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this dangerous chemical. What you don't know CAN hurt you and others throughout the world.Visit DHMO.orgIs it any wonder that people are skeptical after reading all of that slanted, anti-DHMO propaganda? It's not that the above facts are not entirely true. We object to the tone and tactics, not to the message necessarily. We invite you to visit DHMO.org to find out the truth about Dihydrogen Monoxide. Please take the time to visit now, or in the near future. You'll be glad you did",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,backopy,593,2012-06-19T06:33:00,Topic: Developing assets,Safety,"If you're sending stuff over the mail or deal with less legal goods, developing assets may make the difference between being caught in the act or not. Like publicity, the best assets can't be bough with money, making this a mind twist game. So I decided to create this few guidelines about developing social tripwires which can inform you if something is going wrong, like if the cops are on to you. 1) Avoid corruption. Corruption is a shortcut, it's practical, however it gives your asset the leverage of knowing you're up to no good. This makes the price tag in your asset to keep growing with his needs. Also if your asset isn't good in hiding money, like if he goes by buying stuff his wage can't afford, he may rise flags, get caught and drag you along.So, unless what you're doing is too big for hide, avoid this at all costs. 2) See the invisible Our society is full of ""invisible"" persons, they're clerks, janitors, technicians, street cops... people we don't even use to ""see there"", but which are the point of the spear. Politicians, judges and other mid/high profile ranks are actually full of shit, they're indeed totally useless in the society, just them value themselves by casting publicity on their own over and over. But in truth you can live well without Obama but you can't live without the guy that picks the garbage from your front door.This is as valid from your point of view as it is from top to bottom, a law no cop understands or is willing to comply with is as good as no law, as if the cops themselves see nothing wrong on it they will not act on someone doing it (unless someone forces them to), so the law may exist in the paper but nowhere else.So learn to see and use them is important. 3) Keep it casual Do not talk with your asset about what you're doing, this will make him look for bribes to keep silent rounding you to #1. Do some small talk, be nice, find what interests them; local sports, fashion, movies... just be nice but not too much. i.e. Don't go on offer them season tickets or tickets to all movies, that will make them suspicious about what are you up to. Keep your wallet closed, at least most of the time, but vary to match offers from your asset to not make unsettle debts or unbalance the odds, and your mouth open in the fine art of speak a lot and say nothing at all. Don't also agree or disagree to much with him, act as if he were a normal friend; you don't agree or disagree completely with anybody, so keep it there too.Bottom line try to make yourself look like you're a common employee somewhere to have him feeling as if you were on of his peers. 4) Read the signs Here's how you actually use the asset you developed. Let's take to this example that you developed a friendship relation with a PO assistant, if the cops are on to you, they're most likely to start making questions around and eventually will ask some questions around the post office. Your friend will not tell you this, if you developed it correctly he is not under your pay roll, but he's not a trained operative, so he will act nervous in your sight, will avoid your questions or remarks on something that up to so far seamed to interest him or just mumble something back in reply. At this point: move your stuff to somewhere safe and be ready to be raided by cops in a short while. Hope this small guide help you guys to stay safe.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,dewbie226,18040,2014-01-05T05:43:00,Topic: Some Safety Tips For New Members!,Safety,"Hello everyone, I'm copying/pasting this from the Utopia forums. Just a few friendly tips for any new members looking to go down the rabbit hole LOL! ********* It is never possible to be fully secure, however you can drastically reduce the chances of getting caught. From my personal experience, here is what I've learned that may/may not help others: 1. Get used to having multiple wallets. Don't keep all your eggs in a single basket. 2. Tumble your btc before doing wallet to wallet deals. Make sure you have a 'burner' wallet that is not connected with your legit spending wallet! A great service is Bitcoin Fog (search StartPage should get you .onion) 3. Use PGP for all sensitive messages. Usually after-while clear text messages like 'thanks' or 'sent' or whatever are fine with most vendors, but there are some vendors that request EVERYTHING PGP. Respect the wishes of the vendor otherwise move on! If you feel anything is sensitive encrypt always with the vendors public PGP key, and provide the vendor your PGP key too. NEVER GIVE THE PRIVATE KEY!! If the vendor can't decrypt then they are bogus. 4. Use TAILS. TAILS is a live OS that runs in memory that leaves nothing on your computer. It is ran via DVD (read only) or USB (read or read/write). TAILS includes some packages to keep you safe and organized. Don't assume that just using Tor is good enough. Take a few hours like I did and read their documentation carefully, everything you need is on their site (search StartPage for TAILS or clearnet it's open source). 5. Keep consistent backups of your wallets, bookmarks, keys, etc, and keep those backups archived in password protected compressed files and keep on a safe USB drive. 7zip is highly recommended. If you are a messy person irl, then want to be the cleanest possible here! 6. Read reviews before dealing with any vendors. Almost all reputable vendors have review threads. Do your research before you jump in the deep end! 7. Being respectful and polite goes a long way when trying to establish reputation on the darknet. 8. Turn off javascript always. No exceptions. 9. Never view clearnet links on the darknet. The exit nodes can expose your location as well as the site you came from. 10. Use your gut. If you've dealt with a vendor many times and suddenly notice a shift in attitude, bail! Safety > drugs (or whatever your fix is...). 11. Use real name, use real address. Make sure you deal with a vendor that knows how to properly ship product. If your're buying 'drugs' like weed, vacuum sealed packaging inside a MBB (moisture barrier bag) are highly recommended. Vendors with handwritten labels or careless packaging are not recommended. Nothing is worse that YOU taking all the precautions to be anonymous, but because the VENDOR sends a sloppy shipment you get caught. Sending something out of the ordinary to a random address or to an address that doesn't have a matching residential name could raise suspicions. 12. StartPage is a great search engine powered by Google. It supposedly doesn't log your IP address, which is always a wonderful thing. It's all risk vs. reward, you are trying to hide in plain sight. If you take time, take this seriously, and learn something awesome about how the Internet really works then you can seriously turn ANY computer into a station you can log into nearly completely anonymously, portable, and discrete! When you can say you have a work computer that you can take into a public network with a live OS that is on a  portable device, then I think you can say you're doing it right! But still, keep learning, don't be cocky, and be as safe as possible!",NA

There is a MASSIVE burden of proof on the police to make the case that you ordered it, and they won't have that proof if you do some very basic stuff. Receiving mail is also generally not prima facie probable cause, and thus grounds for a house search warrant. Certainly not to confiscate computers etc. That's clearly fishing. Challenge that. 2. NEVER TRANSFER COINS DIRECT FROM AN EXCHANGE. Download MultiBit and transfer from exchange --> multibit --> BMR. It takes just an hour longer and it nicely obscures you. For added points, use a VPN for everything (such as EarthVPN, who are great and you can pay in Bitcoins). For even more points, store your MultiBit wallet in an encrypted TrueCrypt container with a 24 character passphrase. 3. NEVER COMMUNICATE WITHOUT USING PGP.  Seriously, PGP is fucking EASY to use. Download PortablePGP and have everything done in just minutes. That way even if BMR is seized, it's all PGP encrypted and the Feds don't get your address. 4. If police ask to enter your house, ask if they have a warrant. If they don't, politely decline. They'll bluster and bluff about how they can get one if they want. Fine - tell them to do just that. Even if they manage to get one from some idiot judge, you'll be able to challenge and probably invalidate that in court later. 5. If they enter your house - your laptop should ALWAYS be encrypted. I don't care who you are or why you use your laptop, EVERYONE SHOULD USE ENCRYPTION. This isn't for nefarious purposes: it's to protect against identity theft if your computer gets stolen! And if the police ask, that is precisely the answer you give.   Oh, never use Microsoft's BitLocker as that's got NSA master keys in it - use TrueCrypt.  The police (and maybe judge) will threaten you with jailing for contempt of court if you don't hand over the password. Cool - this is a threat that is very rarely carried out, and worst case it'll be a jailing for a couple of months for contempt of court instead of jailing for much much longer for drug charges. It's a great tradeoff and you should totally accept that if they want to do that. Never hand that passcode over. 6. You should also have, handy, a letter you're ""in the process of writing"" addressed to the local post office, regarding ""strange packages to your address"". This bogus letter will be gold when you show it to the police saying that you have no idea why these things show up at your house and you think it's someone trying to frame you, and you're in the process of making a complaint about it. That should defuse things right there. 7. If they get serious and start wanting to take you for questioning: decline to say ANYTHING AT ALL without a lawyer present. Even if you're innocent. There's a good YouTube video explaining exactly why - from a police officer no less! Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1t3vtr0kxk  8. Your stash should be hidden at all times. You should never have drugs or paraphernalia in sight ANYWHERE as that is probable cause if sighted by a cop. Be creative. Triple Ziplock your stuff and then store it preferably in a closed metal container. By the way, sniffer dogs are generally only trained to find ONE drug. That's usually pot or coke. The odds of them having a speed or ketamine or whatever sniffer dog are pretty darn slim. They'll use one anyway but it's just for looks. 9. You should also never keep money or baggies near your stash so if found you can always try going for personal use claims. But if you follow the steps above, it should never come to that. 10. Never ever talk. The police use an old psychological trick: in a conversation, where there's a long pause, the other person will automatically try to fill in the silence by talking. The police use that to their advantage. Do NOT succumb to the urge to talk. And when you do, keep your sentences as short as possible and as loyal to your cover story. Do not use words that can be twisted against you later. LET YOUR LAWYER DO THE TALKING. ALWAYS. 11. Do not mention dates or places unless you have to;  because the police will come back to that later and any discrepancy at all will be used as ""evidence"" you're a liar... even if was an honest mistake. If pressed, say ""I don't recall"" or ""I can't possibly make an accurate reply in my current agitated state, and I don't want to give you incorrect information, so I cannot comment on that at this stage"". 12. Never accept the police's word that your friend has caved on you, or they ""found a trail for the bitcoins that points to you"". They're fishing, and they're allowed to lie. If this happens you should assume a confused and disbelieving look and say ""well, that's not right. Can you show me the details? Maybe we can shed some light on this"". Watch the details not materialise... because it was bullshit. If the police had that evidence it'd be enough to charge you and you wouldn't be sitting in an interrogation room, would you? And they certainly wouldn't tell you about it in advance because that would allow you time to consider a legal defense. They would simply keep quiet about it and throw it on you as a surprise in the courtroom. 13. Never, ever, cave. Lie, lie, lie. And lie some more. The police do NOT EVER EVER ""go easy"" on you for being cooperative. That's the oldest trick in the book. And liars don't really get harsher jail times... because everyone does it! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY LYING UNTIL YOUR LAST BREATH. Famously, there's an example of a man who was caught having sex with another woman by his wife. She said ""what are you doing in bed with that woman?!""  and he replied ""What woman?"" Deny deny deny. It puts THEM on the defensive and it's unexpected and fucks with their strategy to have you cave. 14. If they say they're going to go easy on you ""if you'll just confess now"", then you lie to the hilt and then at the last minute say that if they're serious they need to get a plea deal IN WRITING from the District Attorney. Anything else is not legally binding and you will later find out just how suckered you got. 15. If they turn the camera off and say ""off the record""... don't believe that for a SECOND. There IS no ""off the record"" in a police interrogation room. You think that camera he has on the desk is the one that's used to film you? It's a fucking PROP. The real cameras are filming you, video and sound, from at least 2 angles in each room and in the cells, AT ALL TIMES. Again, see the video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1t3vtr0kxk   to get that straight from the horse's mouth. 16. If you get caught once - for FUCK's sake don't send to that address again. Are you stupid?  You need a private mailbox service, which has to be registered in a friend's name or with false ID. Your name can never, ever be attached to a mailbox where you receive, ever again.",NA

It may be best not to deny this at all, since there is nothing illegal about it.  You can have very good reasons for these transactions. For one, you may simply want to buy BTC to speculate on their exchange rate development. This is not fundamentally different from wiring money to a stocks or currency exchange to do the exact same thing. Also, you could have used the BTC for something legal, such as hiring a VPN service, or order goods from a market like bitmit that deals in legal merchandise.  Both stories are perfectly credible and hard to disprove.  Normally i would not recommend confessing anything, but in case of bank transactions to bitcoin exchanges they will be able to prove them so easily it might be better to explain what you were doing. Denying you have made a wire transfer only makes you more suspect since they will have solid evidence that you are lying within a split second.",NA

Pick a song that you know the lyrics really well to. Take the first letter of each word as your password till you hit your character limit. A song with numbers increases your strength. You can also make every other letter or every third letter or whatever a capital letter. Then sing the song in your head as you type in the password. Thats how I remember a long ass password that otherwise I would never be able to remember.  Bullionaire,NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,11705,2013-11-05T16:23:00,Re: A Few Safety Questions,Safety,"+1 to Bullionaire. Additionally, I would use Tails and public wifi on a ""burner"" laptop bought in cash, just for peace of mind. The maximum method for password security is to remember your password. For example, when creating a Truecrypt volume, you can have up to 64 characters in a password. Find a phrase that is memorable to you and transcribe it into numbers. Lengthen it to your needs, throw a few letters in there and you're good to go. For example: Password: 2151529517T2151529517I2151529517T2151529517T2151529517Y2151529517Shaha How to memorize? Match the numbers to their corresponding letter in the alphabet. Hence, 2151529517 spells BOOBIES. The letters separating the number string spell TITTYS. Then ""haha"" at the end for shits and giggles. So instead of remembering that long ass password, you just need something like this: ((BOOBIES x 6)/TITTYS)+haha And that's how you remember. You could also practice entering it 30 times in a row, and you'll remember the entire string without the helpful hint. Really want to get hardcore? Make your word or phrase a foreign language. Or better yet, a fictional one. Like Klingon.",NA

Most people have heard of brute force cracking, a primitive method: they set a range of password length (e.g. 4-6) and try all letter combinations within this. It will take even longer to try all combinations with Big letters, numbers, special characters and symbols. Brute forcing easily cracks the passwords above. Of course, with captcha's it will take considerably longer, but possible. They use optical character recognition (OCD) to bypass human verification. I learned this at 13 botting in runescape classic... However, if someone knows your password for e.g. facebook - let's say this is horselover (let's hope not), the password for your e.g. BMR account is likely related. E.g. horselover99. With rainbow cracking one uses a known pattern (horselover) and attempt related passwords; horselover1, horselover2, horseloverz etc. What to learn from this?Withstanding brute force cracking Use a password that is going to take a century to brute force, that could be ""#/()yhsi, but it doesn't have to be hard to remember. The following is A LOT harder to crack: ppp333nnn111sss...Withstanding rainbow cracking Don't use the same password anywhere, not even anything related, and not ANYTHING related to your life.

For TrueCrypt containers and the like, I suggest using Diceware.  See: http://www.diceware.com/  The nice things about Diceware are:  - it's prescriptive -- it tells you what to do at every step, there's no ambiguity.  - It's secure. Because words in a passphrase are randomly-chosen via dice rolls, there is no way to crack a Diceware passphrase, except through brute force, even if an opponent knows you used Diceware, and even if they know the length of your passphrase.  A ten-word Diceware passphase has in excess of 129 bits of entropy, more than the AES128, CAST and IDEA ciphers, as used in PGP.",NA

There are currently NO linux virusses. There are crackers though, so check forums for extra security settings.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,backopy,67,2012-02-28T02:15:00,Topic: Create the safer VM,Safety,"Here's a step-by-step guide to create a safe VM: 1. Get TrueCrypt - www.truecrypt.org 2. Get VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org 3. Create a new virtual partition with TrueCrypt enough to host your content, let's say 10 Gb, NTFS or ext3, depending on the OS. And choose one of the following options to protect it:     3.1 - Use an unsuspecting key file, choose a file from your computer to use as key, it can be any file at all but wary about versions if you choose a system or software file. If a single byte is changed in the key file you may not be able to mount the virtual file system again! Also note that some sites edit pictures and videos before sending them to the browser, like Facebook, so if you plan to use your boyfriend/girlfriend's picture as key make sure you've it in a format that doesn't change.Do not create obvious key files, like my-key.txt     3.2 - Use a SuPP3RDUPP3rP4ssword#ButIsn'tTh3B35t0pti0nAsYouProbablyWon'tBeAbleT0R3memberItAft3rw4rds.            Don't use password12345 or your password won't stand for long in a brutte-force attack.Definitely key files makes it easier and avoids you to be locked outside or use an easy to remember but weak password. 4. Mount your Virtual FS with TrueCrypt and create a new VM with VirtualBox using that mounted FS. 5. Install the OS you fancy and proxy everything through Tor there. I normally fancy Windows 2000 for VM client machines, it's lightweight and featured enough to not nag the host OS. There's no need to use an encrypted FS at the guest VM because it already lives inside a TrueCrypt encrypted VM.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,notmyrealname,67,2012-09-22T18:03:00,Re: Create the safer VM,Safety,"I just want to say that this works, i had the feds take my computer and they never figured out what was on there....good thing too, got it back a 4 or so months later.  Couple of points, you can encrypt your OS with truecrypt but may not want to encrypt your entire HDD, put your container on a separate partition and your key files on your encrypted OS. (hide a backup copy somewhere, USB drives are very small and can be easily hidden, maybe stash it at a friends, mix them in with a bunch of other files..pictures can make great keyfiles.) Good strong passwords are always a good thing, but remember when it comes to true crypt if your forget it, the data is gone. Balance out something you can remember and something strong.  The true paranoid (me) will have the OS, trucrypt container and the VM OS all encrypted with separate passwords to each, while this maybe overkill...is there a price to ones freedom? It is only slightly slower, but doable. You can go a extra step beyond this and create a hidden OS where you access your encrypted VM...but this gets annoying, even for the true paranoid (me) If feds come, dont say a word...unlikely there initial search will find anything so no arrest will be made, however, they may press something and then you need a lawyer...and a story. Create a dummy VM, so if they do somehow look at your OS they dont see that the VM is supposed to be there, but is not... The VM container should be hidden and some financial documents or whatever in the non hidden part. Make the password easy to crack(for the non hidden part) so when they do crack it they are left with WTF question...not so much important in the US, but other countries may have questions on the strange file that appears to be encrypted, This way you can have answers to the questions. Also, true crypt containers do not, by default, change the date stamp...If its got enough time then simply claiming you forgot about it, and its password, would be reasonable...though they may be able to disprove this with a open OS, so i refer back to encrypting your OS. Also, regardless of how you handle LE, keep your story straight or shut up(preferable shut up)...i highly suggest you get your story straight with a lawyer before LE...some countries may not be so kind with the lawyer thing, so come up with your story first then create your environment around the story.  I suggest everyone does some research to learn your local laws and rights. Knowing what your up against is half the battle and if LE comes knocking, losing your computer will be the least of your worry's; knowing whats going on will keep your ass out of jail.  At the very minimum, everyone on this site should be on a encrypted OS.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,NoQuestionsAsked,1952,2012-11-28T03:58:00,Re: change user name in middle of transaction?,Safety,"did you release escrow? Ok, bad move, lesson learned! But what exactly do you mean by ""change his name""?I know of no way to change my vendor name, but of course I could have missed some thing. Or do you mean the ssh key changing to a different one? If the user in question has  a nickname with ""r"" being the 3rd character,please send me (or maybe better, some mod) the old key, I already wondered about that, too.It *could* mean that an account is been used by someone other than it's legit owner, but it could be completely harmless, too.(for example, private key only on USB-stick, recommendable if encrypted, too. USB stick lost/broken/unreadable, thus having to create a new key) Unfortunately PGP/GPG is used here (and almost everywhere in the ""official"" ""deepweb"" I know) at such a basic level, if at all, only, that the well-thought-out procedures for such cases are not applicable. I allow myself a little rant, once again (not directed against you, not at all, you had the brains to ask here! This is for those who simply dont care, but it's most surely praying to the converted anyway, since not many bother to read the forum at all, and only come crying when they have lost 1000s of $ - me included, without the crying) If you are here, you are probably doing some illegal things! If you don't care about at least the cost of very expensive lawyers, ok, keep on not using PGP, using your bank-account to transfer money directly to the vendor, bypassing BMR - escrow doesn't matter to you, then, too, of course, with that kind of money - or use privnote, a very good idea, involve a completely unnecessary 3rd party, use the same nickname you also use for your favorite p0rn site (those sites are well known for their outstanding interest in the security of their users, really!), your withdraw-password should be 00001234 or your email-address reversed, nobody will ever think of that, use a clearweb<->TOR proxy, after all, installing the TOR browser bundle is really sooo hard, hey, it could have a virus in it, nonono, IE3 will do nicely! And while you are at it, why not use your pretty face as your avatar?  Exif.data??

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,NoQuestionsAsked,1954,2012-11-28T09:22:00,Re: How get bitcoins on a anonym debit card legaly?,Safety,"Hi, as I said, I am using intersango, but I just checked, they are in invitation only mode currently, and invitations are not given out to existing customers, I have no idea how to get any, nor do I know the reason for this (probably because they have problems with their UK bank and don't want all that negative feedback from customers who don't read their announcements) freefox recommends ""https://www.bitstamp.net"", it works more or less like intersango: You deposit BTCs, and offer them on the market, the lower the price the more chance to find a buyer quickly. So they don't buy your bitcoins themselves but are just like a stock-exchange. Intersango and some other sites work like that, too.The fees are usually very low, it depends on you how fast you need the money converted to EUR to withdraw it onto any account.So if I were you, I'd start exchanging now, a few BTCs at first maybe to learn the system, then set a rather high price until the card arrives and you have registered it. And there is no way to trace the payment back to you, after all, you used bitcoins in between. This part is surely easier and much cheaper (unless you can do it yourself) than buying a fake ID and utility bill.I mean, I could sell you all of this, but ID and UB alone cost about 200 EUR! How many BTCs do you want to exchange?If you want, I can do it with some of my cards, I can also tell you the codes of one card with a few EUR on it so you can test if the card is accepted by your VPS provider. (sometimes, and always in Canada, visa electrons are not accepted, but that's got nothing to do with the ""legitimacy"" of the bank issuing them, but usually with old software. In Canada, anonymous prepaid cards are forbidden completely as I understand.) The bank is a Santango company I think: ""WBK Bank Zachodni WBK"". They have recently changed their website, some of it is also available in english, but not the prepaid anonymous card registration. Just search for IBAN and you will find some offers here, but they are either expensive, or offered by clearly incompetent people who can't even read the word ""VISA"" and offer them as MasterCards. Or they used the wrong picture, but I have yet to see a Polish MasterCard like this. Also, you can use any name with the card, it is not checked by the bank, they clearly state that the card may be fiven to foreigners, so the only ""irregular"", maybe ""illegal"" thing is you giving a wrong name (and address, I guess  ) to the company you rent the VPS from, but that you'd have to do anyway, or you could simply transfer the money directly from your bank-account to theirs. I have just seen that freefox is offering to do the BTC transfer himself: http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=3572 The card is 36$ (if you order <10), the fee for loading is 5$ flat apparently.Probably he won't give you the very best rate there is, but surely will not scam you.You can see the colored links on top of the page? The left in the first row is his.Only very trusted members get such a link, and since the board is specialized on carding and hacking, the admins/mods know quite a lot about the topic, at least some, and they really check offers in the ""Verified"" section. Maybe you can get it for 30$ in the Unverified section or somewhere else, but imo it's not worth the time and the risk. Since I do trust him, I would be willing to do this on a 100% escrow base, in reasonable steps, but it really isn't necessary, and I'd charge you of course, and I'm not cheap  Just do some small amounts, like 10, 20, 30 BTCs, until you are satisfied and believe that you can trust him with the rest. Or just keep on using small amounts, it will cost a bit more (5$ per load), but less risk.",NA

Freedom Hostingâs operator, Eric Eoin Marques, had rented the servers from an unnamed commercial hosting provider in France, and paid for them from a bank account in Las Vegas. Itâs not clear how the FBI took over the servers in late July, but the bureau was temporarily thwarted when Marques somehow regained access and changed the passwords, briefly locking out the FBI until it gained back control. The new details emerged in local press reports from a Thursday bail hearing in Dublin, Ireland, where Marques, 28, is fighting extradition to America on charges that Freedom Hosting facilitated child pornography on a massive scale. He was denied bail today for the second time since his arrest in July. Freedom Hosting was a provider of turnkey âTor hidden serviceâ sites â special sites, with addresses ending in .onion, that hide their geographic location behind layers of routing, and can be reached only over the Tor anonymity network. Tor hidden services are used by sites that need to evade surveillance or protect usersâ privacy to an extraordinary degree â including human rights groups and journalists. But they also appeal to serious criminal elements, child-pornography traders among them. On August 4, all the sites hosted by Freedom Hosting â some with no connection to child porn â began serving an error message with hidden code embedded in the page. Security researchers dissected the code and found it exploited a security hole in Firefox to identify users of the Tor Browser Bundle, reporting back to a mysterious server in Northern Virginia. The FBI was the obvious suspect, but declined to comment on the incident. The FBI also didnât respond to inquiries from WIRED today. But FBI Supervisory Special Agent J. Brooke Donahue was more forthcoming when he appeared in the Irish court yesterday to bolster the case for keeping Marques behind bars, according to local press reports. Among the many arguments Donahue and an Irish police inspector offered was that Marques might reestablish contact with co-conspirators, and further complicate the FBI probe. In addition to the wrestling match over Freedom Hostingâs servers, Marques allegedly dove for his laptop when the police raided him, in an effort to shut it down. Donahue also said Marques had been researching the possibility of moving his hosting, and his residence, to Russia. âMy suspicion is he was trying to look for a place to reside to make it the most difficult to be extradited to the U.S.,â said Donahue, according to the Irish Independent. Freedom Hosting has long been notorious for allowing child porn to live on its servers. In 2011, the hactivist collective Anonymous singled out the service for denial-of-service attacks after allegedly finding the firm hosted 95 percent of the child porn hidden services on the Tor network. In the hearing yesterday, Donahue said the service hosted at least 100 child porn sites with thousands of users, and claimed Marques had visited some of the sites himself. Reached by phone, Marquesâ lawyer declined to comment on the case. Marques faces federal charges in Maryland, where the FBIâs child-exploitation unit is based, in a case that is still under seal. The apparent FBI-malware attack was first noticed on August 4, when all of the hidden service sites hosted by Freedom Hosting began displaying a âDown for Maintenanceâ message. That included at least some lawful websites, such as the secure email provider TorMail. Some visitors looking at the source code of the maintenance page realized that it included a hidden iframe tag that loaded a mysterious clump of Javascript code from a Verizon Business internet address. By midday, the code was being circulated and dissected all over the net. Mozilla confirmed the code exploited a critical memory management vulnerability in Firefox that was publicly reported on June 25, and is fixed in the latest version of the browser. Though many older revisions of Firefox were vulnerable to that bug, the malware only targeted Firefox 17 ESR, the version of Firefox that forms the basis of the Tor Browser Bundle â the easiest, most user-friendly package for using the Tor anonymity network. That made it clear early on that the attack was focused specifically on de-anonymizing Tor users. Tor Browser Bundle users who installed or manually updated after June 26 were safe from the exploit, according to the Tor Projectâs security advisory on the hack. The payload for the Tor Browser Bundle malware is hidden in a variable called âmagneto.â Perhaps the strongest evidence that the attack was a law enforcement or intelligence operation was the limited functionality of the malware. The heart of the malicious Javascript was a tiny Windows executable hidden in a variable named âMagneto.â A traditional virus would use that executable to download and install a full-featured backdoor, so the hacker could come in later and steal passwords, enlist the computer in a DDoS botnet, and generally do all the other nasty things that happen to a hacked Windows box. But the Magneto code didnât download anything. It looked up the victimâs MAC address â a unique hardware identifier for the computerâs network or Wi-Fi card â and the victimâs Windows hostname. Then it sent it to a server in Northern Virginia server, bypassing Tor, to expose the userâs real IP address, coding the transmission as a standard HTTP web request. âThe attackers spent a reasonable amount of time writing a reliable exploit, and a fairly customized payload, and it doesnât allow them to download a backdoor or conduct any secondary activity,â said Vlad Tsyrklevich, who reverse-engineered the Magneto code, at the time. The malware also sent a serial number that likely ties the target to his or her visit to the hacked Freedom Hosting-hosted website. The official IP allocation records maintained by the American Registry for Internet Numbers show the two Magneto-related IP addresses were part of a ghost block of eight addresses that have no organization listed. Those addresses trace no further than the Verizon Business data center in Ashburn, Virginia, 20 miles northwest of the Capital Beltway. The codeâs behavior, and the command-and-control serverâs Virginia placement, is also consistent with whatâs known about the FBIâs âcomputer and internet protocol address verifier,â or CIPAV, the law enforcement spyware first reported by WIRED in 2007. Court documents and FBI files released under the FOIA have described the CIPAV as software the FBI can deliver through a browser exploit to gather information from the targetâs machine and send it to an FBI server in Virginia. The FBI has been using the CIPAV since 2002 against hackers, online sexual predators, extortionists, and others, primarily to identify suspects who are disguising their location using proxy servers or anonymity services, like Tor. Prior to the Freedom Hosting attack, the code had been used sparingly, which kept it from leaking out and being analyzed. No date has been set for Marquesâ extradition hearings, but itâs not expected to happen until next year.",NA

If the VPS guys *had* been malicious, they would most likely have copied the entire PHP code discreetly and keep it to themselves.The user of the above topic has simply encountered the issue while visiting BMR, apparently, and has taken upon himself to publish it so that the info was out as soon as possible (and thanks to him for that too). Even if someone (any visitor while the issue occured) managed to get a config.php or similar containing the MySQL credentials, it's unlikely the database was reachable from outside (although dumping the code, finding a RCE flaw, and using it to dump the DB from the server would theorically have been possible) - which is most likely why backopy is confident the passwords have not been stolen and the database was most likely not even accessed, and therefore is allowing users to retrieve their BTC using their old passwords. Finally, though, I'd imagine there is still a (very) small possibility that someone managed to dump the code, find a remote code execution flaw amazingly quickly, injected some code to dump the database, and thus managed to retrieve it.My question is therefore: were the passwords hashed in the database ? if yes, with what ? were they salted ?

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,afrocajk66,11714,2013-11-03T09:33:00,Topic: Tails + public hotspot + socks5 proxy,Safety,"Hi Everyone! I would like to ask how secure is the described method (eg. for carding or shopping on BMR): 1. Using Tails live DVD, or USB with hardware write-protection switch 2. Using public hotspot: since macchanger doesn't run on boot, it's unavoidable to leak MAC address (unless you have physical wlan switch on laptop, right?), but connecting to tor is not illegal, so until nothing ""bad"" happens, it is completely legal. Maybe against ToS, but for that, I don't give a s**t. Now, when about to do business, run sudo ifconfig wlan0 (or wlan1, whatever...) down sudo macchanger -a wlan0 (wlan1)sudo ifconfig wlan0 up and the WiFi router notices that my original MAC address disappears, and a new device is connected (with the generated MAC). It could possibly log that my original laptop was connected to hotspot, but nothing compromising. Am I correct? 3. Start browsing, buying etc. through Iceweasel (Tor, of course), being careful not to send sensitive info unencrypted, or even not at all. 4. When I want to use a proxy (e.g. from vip72), how do I set it up in Tails?Is it just in the Vidalia control panel -> settings -> network, or should be anything else done to hide/alter the exit node? I can think of proxychains, but is it still necessary? (I think Vidalia controls ALL traffic, but correct me if I'm wrong)If proxychains is needed, how do You set it up? 5. When done, just turn the laptop off (and remove the Tails drive) and leave the place. I've read many arguments for/against using VPN+Tor simultaneously, and in which way (Tor -> VPN vs. VPN -> Tor).Since I don't trust any VPN host, and the entry/exit node limiting properties of VPN, I would rather go without it.Of course, arguments are always welcome.  Plus, as someone said, the LEA won't deal with regular, ""pity"" cases, just the big fish. What do You think about this, and the necessary level of security? I am looking forward to reading answers of mainly experienced/professional Tails/Debian/Tor users or devs. Of course, everyone is welcome!  Thanks!",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,rememberremember,11714,2013-11-04T18:21:00,Re: Tails + public hotspot + socks5 proxy,Safety,"Hey there! I can tell you straight off that I am nowhere near an expert on linux distributions. I would like to chip in--for what it's worth--on two things: ""2. Using public hotspot: since macchanger doesn't run on boot, it's unavoidable to leak MAC address (unless you have physical wlan switch on laptop, right?), but connecting to tor is not illegal, so until nothing ""bad"" happens, it is completely legal. Maybe against ToS, but for that, I don't give a s**t."" You're right, using TOR--at least in the US--is not illegal. I know some countries are a great deal more sensitive about TOR due to active censorship issues. As far as the MAC address thing goes, for all practical purposes, you're fine. I would like to share with you my philosophy on staying safe though: Treat everything you're doing as if you've got a suit sitting over your shoulder just waiting for you to fuck up. The most extreme LE crusade MIGHT try and call that circumstantial evidence. Many ISP's--including ones who service public Wifi--know when people log onto TOR. Really it wouldn't matter unless you made a mistake elsewhere and they just tacked the MAC address on there to say: ""yeah, see?"" My point is, if you can take measures to increase your security, you probably should. DPR was canned because of small screw ups, after all. My advice--buy a new/used laptop in cash and use it only for your darknet dealings. Using your personal system just creates more work and more chances for mistakes. That way, if the MAC address goes on record before you can change it, so what? It's not connected to your real identity in any way. Scrap it every couple of months and get a new one. For instance, I spend a lot of my time traveling. First thing I do after I get settled in a new country is go out and buy a cheap laptop/netbook in local currency. When I'm done with it, I remove the battery, hard drive, and the RAM. I smash the HDD and RAM, and dispose of the 4 total components into 4 separate public trash bins as I walk around exploring. Rinse and repeat.  ""Plus, as someone said, the LEA won't deal with regular, ""pity"" cases, just the big fish. What do You think about this, and the necessary level of security?"" Most of that is answered above, but my two cents: Never base your security--and your freedom--on an assumption of what LE won't do. Assume the worst and plan accordingly.",NA

So that means the ISP doesn't see ""just another tunnel"", but he specifically sees: ""ah, it's TOR!"" Correct? If this is indeed correct, the following danger exists: Say I exchange PM's with someone who offers to provide a service to me. We reach an agreement, I pay - and then it turns out that this person is in reality a police officer. Let's say the service I was looking for is something that would be of interest to only 50-some people. He can then find out my real identity. All he has to do is request the ISP records for all 50-some suspects, select only those persons who use TOR - which would probably be only me, possibly one or two other persons too - and then compare the timestamps of his PM's to the times when my ISP saw me using TOR.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Rondbuik,2891,2013-01-24T16:00:00,Re: What can my Internet provider see when I use TOR?,Safety,"I'm still not convinced. I'll explain my scenario in more detail. First, I take all precautions: HD is completely truecrypted, I boot from DVD to run TOR, nothing can be written to HD during TOR sessions because HD is truecrypted and therefore effectively unaccessible. In short: no traces whatsoever on my computer or on any storage medium. So, I communicate through TOR, and I exchange PM's with a mister X. Let's say I know my ex fiance keeps a LOT of money stored somewhere. I agree with mr. X that he will break into her house, steal the money, keep 50% for himself, and send 50% to me. It then turns out that mr. X is an LE officer. So LE asks my ex fiance who knows about her hidden money. She identifies ten people, and I'm one of them. So these ten people are now suspects for engaging in illegal activities. LE asks the ISP's of the ten suspects to hand over connection data. Let's say two out of the ten suspects turn out to use TOR. I am, of course, one of them. The LE officer knows that I sent PM's to him on Monday 20:15, Wednesday 21:50, and so on. My ISP's data show that I was using TOR on Monday from 20:10 to 20:20, and on Wednesday from 21:45 tot 22:00. Data from the other suspect's ISP show that he was not using TOR during those two times. So... LE will know it was me. Is this legal proof? I'm not sure, but I do fear it might very well be... Sorry for the long story - didn't know how to explain this more concisely. Anyway, I'd very much like to hear your opinions about this.",NA

There is no proof - but there are very, very strong hints. I get your point - but do you get mine? 1. A person called C is a criminal, identity unknown, who is posting on a TOR forum and exchanging PM's through TOR.2. C contacts, through TOR, a person called L, who is an LE official who pretends to be a criminal.3. C asks L to do some illegal job. C pays L for the job.4. M is me.5. L asks M's ISP to provide M's internet data.6. L sees the following:    - whenever M was using TOR, C was using TOR.    - whenever C was using TOR, M was using TOR.    - whenever M was not using TOR, C was not using TOR.    - whenever C was not using TOR, M was not using TOR. Now M is on a very short list of suspects of the crime.Of those very few suspects, only three are occasionally using TOR.The usage of TOR by the other two suspects does not correlate with C's usage of TOR.The usage of TOR by M correlates perfectly with C's usage of TOR. Wouldn't that be sufficient indication that C and M are the same person? Remember: a DNA match isn't proof either, because the way of matching is NOT unique. Yet, the chances of two persons having the same DNA fingerprint are so close to zero that a DNA match is considered sufficient proof. EVEN IF THERE REMAINS A POSSIBILITY THAT TO DIFFERENT PERSONS DO HAVE A PERFECT DNA MATCH. So, if a DNA match is considered proof even if there is still less than 100% certainty, why would the above correlation between C's and M's TOR usage not be considered proof?",NA

You will be able to encrypt messages using other peoples private keys (which you have to import) so that only they can read it. And you are able to create your own Keys here aswell. In order for other people to message you safely so that only you can decrypt what they have encrypted for you, you will need to provide them with a public key.The Private/Secret Key is for you and you only, it is additionally empowered with a password so that people will still need a password if they manage to steal your private key from you.. although that is easily bruteforceable with enough resources. Kleopatra and GNU Privacy Assistant will automatically handle the private key for you so that you will only need to input a password. You should however protect your Secret key so that it doesnt fall into the wrong hands. There are a multitude of ways doing this (printing out hardcopies, saving onto a Open Source Alternative to Truecrypt encrypted USB flashstick etc etc).

The reason for doing that was because keys used for both signing & encryption (like the ones Kleopatra generates by default) leak some private key bits, and are accordingly easier to break.  If I were in your shoes, I'd switch to GPG4USB. Much cleaner interface, and easier tor newbies to use.  GPG4USB homepage: http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/index.html",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,sms4tor,2428,2012-12-31T17:19:00,Topic: New TOR Service - Alternative to PGP - Encrypted Anonymous Messaging,Safety,"Hello BMR community, I've been using TOR and BMR for quite a long time now and have decided to give back.  I've setup a system that allows for you to send secure/encrypted messages without using PGP or any other complex tools, just a browser that's on TOR.  The idea is based upon services such as Privnote.com, yet our service is ONLY available on TOR at http://sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion.  The process is simple, create a note, get a URL that includes the encryption key to your note, send that URL to anyone, once the URL is used once we wipe the encrypted note from the database.  All data is stored with bCrypt, so even with root access (i.e. the admins) none of the data can be read.   We invite you to come check out the service and hope it makes life a heck of a lot easier for TOR and BMR users. Here's the FAQ from the service to give you a better idea of how it works... 1. How does this site work? Simple, you enter your message and click ""I'm Done!"", our system will then encrypt the message and store it in our database. You will then get the URL to retrieve the message. You give this unique URL to the person you want to read the message. Once the URL has been used the message is instantly wiped from our database and cannot be retrieved again. All messages that sit dormant for over 30 days are automatically wiped from the system.2. How is this secure? We have taken every step possible to secure your message. First, we encrypt your message data using bCrypt, a stronger encryption method than required by any governmental agency. Then we give you the only key to decrypt the data, which is embedded in the URL that you receive for reading the message. Even with full access root level access to our web server and/or database the data stored there is useless without the key that only you hold. The service is hosted in a secure datacenter on dedicated hardware, not somewhere in the cloud. We take backups of our data on an hourly basis, ensuring that your messages are secure from any unforeseen failures.3. Why are you providing this service? The creators of the project understand the need for privacy in communications. While there are methods that exist there are none as easy and secure as our system. We have created this system with the goal of simplifying the process of secure communications within the TOR network.4. What if I make a mistake in a note, how do I fix it? Easy! Just enter the URL key in your browser, this show you your note and then destroy it. Just enter it again with your corrections and we'll generate a new URL for you.5. Can someone read my note by clicking back, or using browser history? No, once a note is read it cannot be loaded again, it's wiped from the database, never to be read again.6. I misplaced the URL, can you retrieve my message or send me the URL again? No, we don't store the URL's as they contain the key to your secure data. You'll need to recreate your message and let your old message expire from our database.7. How do I contact you? We can be contacted at sms4tor (at) tormail (dot) org. Of course we recommend that you use our system to generate the message, then just send us the link, we'll reply in the same manner.8. This is a great service, how can we help to keep it online? While we don't expect to make money with this service we do appreciate donations to cover the hosting costs and beer necessary to keep the site running. You can send us some some spare Bitcoin at: 1KmoRJYnzWvPsa5vBDpayUXX4Nz1CmZft8. All the best!",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,NoQuestionsAsked,2428,2013-01-02T10:59:00,Re: New TOR Service - Alternative to PGP - Encrypted Anonymous Messaging,Safety,"I've always wondered what the use of such a service really is? After all, there are two parties A1 and B, who want to communicate in private.WIth any service such as privnote or yours or whatever, a 3rd party is incolved, which I see absolutely no need for! BMR does only ENcrypt the address (or whatever a buyer enters into that field when placing an order) with the VENDOR's public key. They NEVER get the private key (unless of course you send it to backopy  ).So, unless you distrust backopy (or his skills) there is no way the message could be read by a 3rd party. BUT if you are using a service that does the ENcryption AND the DEcryption, both keys, or a symmetric key, or whatever is necessary to decrypt the message, MUST be stored somewhere on the 3rd party's server.Or am I missing something here? So the only reason to use such a service would be that the user is too stupid or lazy (sorry) to learn the least bit about cryptography. PGP/GPG is *really* not hard to use those days, and you only need the encryption part, dn't bother with signing, key-rings, etc., that's more complicated and not really necessary in this context, and if not really well understood could create a false sense of security. And that's what's worrying me most: Giving people a FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!Tor is not secure for sure, in fact, it can be so easily broken one can assume that it has been by numerous agencies, not only the NSA (who probably can break any PGP message if they have sufficient reason to, but even than, the ressources are probably not spent on small-scale smcall-volume things like SR, BMR, etc. . You are even adding a lot of code which almost surely has some bugs (no insult intended, but that's just a fact of ""life"", code has bugs, had bus, and always will have bugs. And the more code you add the greater the likelihood of new bugs. ""Especially"" with TOR services, I have found amazing things in a few hours of investigating some common TOR services) Don't get me wrong: I think it's very nice of you to offer such a service and you seem to have put some thought into this, so maybe it's really me who is missing something here, and I would really be grateful  for an explanation why one should use this service instead of installing one of the numerous GPG/PGP implementations out there (yes, they could have a backdoor built in by someone, yes, some algorithms are ""broken"" (which doesn't usually mean that just anyone can decrpyt them, just that they are not as strong as commonly believed, there is no mathematical prove for the NP-completeness of the algorithms anyway, as of yet, but very strong hints, at least so strong that banks, the military, etc. rely upon them)",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,jewelsandothers,2432,2013-03-13T21:22:00,Re: Buying Bitcoins with debit card or paypal account,Safety,i have used them before and how they do it is they limit the amount that you can deposit for the first month then when you deposit money you buy sll(second life currency) which you exchange for btc. now withdraws are manualy approved so if somethings fishy they will cancel the withdraw and. so even if you manage to scam them its gonna be for 200$ or less.  now btcquick requires you to upload docs proving your address and your only allowed to buy a certain # of coins per day which are manuly procceded (you buy a private key with say 1-10 btc in it ) and you have to use the card that has the same name as the docs. and if you were able to scam them once they would block your account and bar you from ever buying from their site again. they validate all doxs so you cant use fake ones. so i have answered your claims and also you probbaly never visted these sites so before you argue with me again on this issue at least go their. and you are right in the sense that most  sites wouldn't do this for fear of scammers but they  are small scale site and virwox handles 60000 btc a month and btcquick does 500 a month.,NA

Now there are some technical tricks you can do with a linux or BSD based OS distribution that will make datagathering a living nightmare for the Cops, but the only way to truly protect your clients (and yourself from a legal standpoint) is locking yourself out  to have complete plausible deniability, unfortunately this means not being able to service the machines/servers without initiating a forced wipe of the machine/disk and having to redo the configuration. I have pretty much decided that offering this commercially would not be viable below 20$ a month per VPN and i highly doubt that people are willing to pay for that.The ONLY VPN providers i would somewhat trust are those located in russia (due to legal and technical reasons) but i wouldnt trust the operators to keep a logless server.If you want to get a VPN from a provider where US/EU truly will have no cooperation then prepare yourselves for shitty peering and bandwidth that will make you cringe at the pageloading speeds.",NA

Usually put them in an old Rx bottle for some random prescription so they shouldn't think twice about it. Just make sure only identical pills in each bottle. Or, I think someone on BMR sells Rx labels and bottles custom tailored to your needs. Another option is to get small bottle of vitamins or something in a non see-through bottle and has one of those silver or white lift off covers to prove item has not been tampered with. Then, just carefully lift it a tiny bit and put pills in it and then reseal it w/ some Superglue.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,sexyflexy,1303,2012-10-18T23:29:00,"Topic: Want to buy a gun? Ok first of all, give me your money and ill brb ;)",Safety,"The Mods have been saying this for so long it feels like Im going around in circles... hopefully people read up on these forums first before they fall for the traps...what are the traps? I wont say.. Not going to teach scammers how to perfect their techniques, all I will say is this.. a trap is anything that involves you releasing your hard earned money before you are holding that particular thing in your hand and are happy with it.  1. Escrow People. Escrow... is the ONLY protection you have. Dont release escrow. Ever. Unless you have a relationship with that vendor and he/she has sold something to you previously.. even a couple of times. then you can release... but I would like to offer a suggestion that even then, theres no point? If you trust the vendor then thats fantastic.. if you are getting the product/s and your happy then thats your decision to make.. you should never be requested to release early however, you should do it yourself out of the kindness of your heart. But it is always a risk. The postal service is a risk. Whoever claims 100% success rate is either bullshitting or talking from their own past successes to get that product to you.. however post is still a risk that can be calculated.. especially in the future.. no one knows what the hell is going to happen next year or the year after but right now.. it is still a calculated risk. Might be a tiny 5% risk.. but it is still a risk.  2. Vendor told me to do it because hes been ripped off.. We are involved in ILLEGAL ACTIVITY! people are ripped off in normal LEGAL business! Talk to any lawyer and he can tell you about scams hes had to battle... Any vendor that bitches and moans about buyers ripping them off and so therefore has 'trust issues' which results in FE... is... in my humble opinion... not someone I would do business with.. ever. Selling shit through the internet is fucking protection enough... its a part of business to lose a sale here and there, in normal everyday situations .. use the system to its advantage.. there are ways to prove it was/wasnt delivered...  3. Suspicion  No one is suspicious enough! Im suspicious of everyone!!!! At all times! Escrow is the only reason I am online. 4. Explanation by a story of all of the above: a) RELEASING ESCROW  Let me put it this way...  Its 3am.. dark alley in the downtown of whatever city.. your standing there waiting for someone who you have never done business with or even know his reputation or anything at all about that person.. he shows up.. your there to purchase something.. he says to you ""I dont have it with me.. give me the money first.. and Ill take your money.. walk away and then i promise Ill bring the goods back.""  risk to reward... If that was me and i was looking to get high... and BMR and SR was down then I the risk Im willing to take would amount to something I could replace easy and wouldnt care too greatly about.. All I would lose in the transaction is 50 bucks.. or whatever.. it would be small.. and even then I would be suspicious and wonder why the hell the guy with the products didnt just bring the thing with him.. Soo if im suspicious of someone over 50 bucks.. what if it was something worth thousands of dollars? How would you feel giving him all that money? and then watching him walk away... If you release escrow.. that is what you are doing.. end of story. You start hoping that he comes back.... hours tick by...  B) NOT RELEASING ESCROW Same situation, same dark alley.. however in this situation as your walking up to the alley...you notice backopy! your good friend and pal.. who you can trust because you know he overseas such deals and watches every one and has the muscle to fuck everyone over.  You walk up to him give him your money tell him what you want, shake his hand. Tell him hes awesome for helping you out and you walk away. Later on you get a phone call to go back and see him. You roll up, Backopy is there as he said he would be.. hes always there.. and he hands you the product. He asks you if your happy... the ball is COMPLETELY in your court... you tell him yes/no. If yes. you shake his hand.. walk away with your stuff and your happy.. next backopy calls the guy and gives him his money.. taking a cut for himself... Everyone is happy.. everyone got everything they wanted. If as the buyer you try to pull something dodgy and say thats not what you wanted, backopy will look into it and if convinced your lying then he will fuck you over big time and you will find it alot harder to do business again. If your straight forward he will be there next time to look after you. For those who havent caught onto my cryptic parable backopy is the escrow in this situation.  Moral of the story: dont release escrow. Escrow gives you the only protection you have. Just stay in it.....  SF",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,jbs,7115,2013-09-19T05:06:00,Topic: Is FBI/NSA trying to compromise my webserver's location?,Safety,"Hi guys! I'm hosting a hidden service with some 'nasty' content. (Not CP, not porn at all, but selling some expensive stolen goods.)About 3 days ago, I noticed some unusual activity on the webserver. In every 2 seconds(!) somebody makes a request to my website, always requesting the same subpage, specifically the subpage where the goods are listed. He/she keeps hammering it 3 days by now, with interruptions. It is clearly some kind of a bot.The connections are originating from TOR, not just because the requests are coming from 127.0.0.1, but because if I pause the TOR daemon, the requests also suddenly stops. It cannot be a DDOS attack, 'cause this is too slow for it, my host is up and perfectly running during these requests. So what kind of attack is this?The other thing is that these request are coming every 1-2 seconds, which is way too fast, considering the current speed of the TOR network. Even if I start pressing the refresh button on my browser it takes 7-15 seconds to reload the page. How can someone manage reloading my page every 2 (or 1!) seconds, and doing it for hours? Perhaps it is 'somebody' with huge resources? I read at the tor project's site that the FBI/NSA is starting new methods to deanonymize TOR users. It is a method where officials trying to examine traffic flows inside TOR. Or the 'global adversary' theory, where if somebody can oversee big chunk of the internet, he can visit the hidden service, and then see if the traffic flow on his Tor client is correlated with any traffic flows he sees elsewhere on the Internet, e.g. connecting from a Tor relay to a Tor client. Is this unusual traffic on my server can be connected to this, or I'm just paranoid? Also, anyone else seeing this kind of traffic on their own server? (The bigger players, like SR, or BMR surely can be a target, if this method is real.) Maybe I'm too paranoid about this... but maybe I'm not. What do you think? Thanks.",NA

(USA ones have instant verification, meaning quick delivery) Now you must setup a Donation button on a website. I recommend purchasing a hosting account from HostZealot.com because they are Offshore and they are really nice. They also have great customer service and unlimited everything. Create a basic HTML page with nothing but your donation button you created on PayPal. Now, go to that page, and what we are going to do is click the Donate Button. Once you've clicked the donate button you'll need to update the total to the amount of money you want to transfer from your card to that PayPal account. Once you've done this, login with your verified PayPal's credentials. Now make donation. Pay the donation with your Anonymous Visa Debit Card you've purchased from me and put your Euros on. Once you pay with your card you can check your PayPal's balance, and whala! You have converted your Bitcoin to Euros and put them on a PayPal account instantly without needing to wait 3-6 days. Nice huh? Now you can go ahead and make purchases for illegal items through PayPal and receive illegal payments. Good luck to you. Please comment if you have anything you'd like to say or if you have any questions.",NA

I've heard from people who use it all the time and no problem. PGP is perfectly legal so they have no grounds to do anything even if they wanted to. I'm not saying its as good as your system. Your system sounds really complicated with all the stuff you have to dl and set up. The nice thing about tor was it was simple and easy. The more complicated something is the more chance to screw it up. I figure i would screw it up. Wouldn't the recipient of the message in your system have to have the same set up?

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Turd_Russell,374,2012-05-06T09:33:00,Re: Using Home Address,Safety,"A PO box is kind of the same as delivery to your home: You have to show your ID. And abandoned drops, well, this depends on the kind of drop. If it looks unsuspicious and is in a moderate condition, it might work. But if you use e.g. an abandoned house, which has been empty for several years or is known to be abandoned, it raises suspicion and the mail goes back (maybe a note is left in the letterbox).So, that in mind, try to see it from a vendors view: If I ship illegal products worldwide and someone f*cks around with the safety, I'm hold accountable for it. So, better use a fake name and address.Taken all together, it would succumb to this: The product is sent to a drop, the mailman realizes, this must be a mistake and takes it back. No one claims it, and it is resent to the seller, which doesn't exist. Conclusion: Product lost, drop marked, no one is happy.The best way is: Give your own address (maybe with one mistake in your name, I'll explain it later), the vendor should be as stealthy as possible, minimizing the risk of getting confiscated (e.g. triple sealing, layers of paper inside a greeting card, product placed inside a box with various things...) and it should arrive. I think sunnypharma has written a beautiful thread explaining the methods of x-ray people (they're tired and mostly give just a glance, so: more layers, less suspicion). Or (sorry for the advertisement, but I'm really happy wih them), for example, use a aluminum adhesive to seal the layers with the already sealed product and put them in tobaccos brown bags, zip them and seal them. This way an almost 100% success is achievable (I say almost, because you'll never know.)In case of the really unlikely event of getting a love letter from the authorities, you can still deny knowledge of what you have received. Say for example someone else must be doing it (hint to the mistake of your name in the address field!) or just plain say, it wasn't you and you don't know what that is! tl;dr... In short words: Give your real address with kind of your real name, the vendor is advised to make it as stealthy as possible and everything is set! Professionality and a bit of trust is needed... We're almost all pros here!",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Turd_Russell,374,2012-05-06T09:39:00,Re: Using Home Address,Safety,"One more thing: If you're asking a friend as a drop, make sure, they're OK with receiving something maybe illegal! It's most likely that they open it, because when done right, the letter/package will look so unsuspicious, that he won't even know, what it contains and open it. So, in the unlikely case something goes wrong, they will be held responsible. As an example: Use a ""clean"" friend to order drugs, in the eyes of the authorities someone who doesn't use drugs will never order some...Also: Your workplace doesn't even range in the top 100 solutions!!! I've had a customer, who ordered to his workplace, looked up the DCN and it said, it was delivered, but the package was gone. Few days later, the opened package was on his desk.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,Rempelman,374,2012-07-24T13:29:00,Re: Using Home Address,Safety,"Hi, I want to add some things to this discussion, but let me first introduce myself by saying I am new here (and to tor darknet and bitcoins), but am a seller of legitimate goods on multiple site on the clearnet, but only plan on buying here for now. First, I have a pobox and I do occasionally get mail addressed to the person who had it before me (or maybe the one even before that?) and let me tell you this is not fan mail! Apparently the company the previous owner was running has debts and I recieve threatening demands for bills to be paid, LOL! I am in no way responsible for that just because I have the po box now. Pobox mail is delivered on the basis of the po box number alone, the name doesn't matter. As for names I have some other interesting info I learned while watching some real life series about Australian border control. They were showing how one of the post guys picks out packages that he believes require better inspection. They have to do it like that as there is no way to inspect everything indept. And he picked out one with a silly name like "" King Abdoul the second"" (living somewhere in Australia!). His commentary was that such such silly names immediately set off his alarm bells and later examination did reveal heroin in the package. It was hidden in chess piece boxes. One box had three horses in it, LOL! So don't go weird on names would be my advice. You only make it look suspicious. What is more straightforward than a package addressed to your correct full name? Or you all fear package damage?  I actually look different at these tv programs now. They are good study material on how not to do things!",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,bratac,10437,2013-10-23T18:20:00,Re: Encrypting the encrypted??,Safety,"As explained in another thread, the problem with using the auto encryption feature is that your address goes to the BMR server in cleartext. Thus, if the BMR server was (secretly) compromised, theorically the attacker (LE or other) could get your address.The best practice is to disable the auto encryption feature in your profile, and encrypt manually (copy pasting the encrypted block into the address textarea before submitting your order). However, if you do *not* have the necessary knowledge to encrypt yourself, or just can't be bothered to do it, then let the auto encryption enabled:it's better than nothing :-) that way if the hardware of the vendor is seized, even if your address hasn't be deleted yet on his side, it's encrypted and unreadable.(besides, backopy appears to know what he's doing when it comes to security - I believe he said the server moves regularly, etc... so a deep compromise like happened with SR is unlikely) EDIT - that was the thread I was talking about: http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewtopic.php?pid=66572#p66572",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,10437,2013-10-23T20:39:00,Re: Encrypting the encrypted??,Safety,"You do not strictly need to disable the automatic encryption to use your own - you can use both at the same time. The PGP output you send will be automagically encrypted and decrypted between you and the other person once more, but this does not hinder communication.  Encrypting things several times along the way is not that uncommon, though you can only really rely on the end to end encryption you put in place. Everything else can be compromised by all kinds of methods, including things like the BMR server being compromised etc. If that were to happen, communication using your own public and private keys outside of the website would still be secure.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,bratac,10437,2013-10-23T20:49:00,Re: Encrypting the encrypted??,Safety,"Actually, that's true - letting it on should have no noticeable impact :-)It does not increase security though, as the message would simply be encrypted twice with the same public key (break one, you broke both). EDIT: oops - not completely true, actually: letting it on means the _vendor_ will have to decrypt it twice (IE, copy paste the encrypted address, decrypt it, then copy paste the resulting encrypted block, and decrypt it again with the same key). It will be bothersome for the seller, with no added security - not that big a thing, of course, but since it doesn't add security there's really no point in doing it in my opinion.",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,10437,2013-10-24T20:00:00,Re: Encrypting the encrypted??,Safety,"There would indeed be NO point in encrypting something twice with the same public key.  I merely meant to state that it would add security if you work with 2 different keypairs: one handled by BMR automatically, and a -different- set on top of that which would require manual decoding by the seller.  The main thing that would be protected by using this extra keypair is traffic between you and BMR being secured. As i understand, if the vendor has installed a public key the server will encrypt any messages to the vendor using his public key. This, however, happens on the server, and communication between you and the server is NOT encrypted.",NA

Windows 7 - Datamining/Spyware embedded in OS!,Safety,"I did a bit of research today and found out the following: Windows 7 will often transmit quite a substantial amount of (encrypted) data to US National Security Agency Datamining servers. i noticed the massive amount of connection tries in peerblock, and turned it off for a few minutes. then i inspected it with a packet sniffing tool and it was transmitting at the rate of like 10mb per minute. I couldn't decrypt what it was doing but it seems like theyre logging and transmitting every action due the amount of data being transferred. Sometimes for hours on end windows will transmit, making connections every second to addresses like the one below.It seems this occurs especially often whenever there is activity on the internet connection, but it also happened while i was not doing anything online at all and did not even have a browser or anything running. 94.245.121.253 -> teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com.nsatc.net a whois for NSATC.net will shows it belongs to ""Level 3 Communications inc"" After searching for this company i found on cryptome it belongs to an NSA IP range, which shouldn't be a surprise since the domain even has NSA in the name.

There is no evidence, etc, I will at worst loose my gun permit (  ), but THIS is something I do not understand, and I really want to avoid any misinterpretations.Is there anyone here who feels threatened by ME ? I hope not, I have always done my best to avoid exactly that. Just because I happen to have two guns, which I probably couldn't even use efficiently in a confrontation, doesn't mean I will extinguish a live for some small or medium amount ( > 4 million.... hmm... would think about it  no, I just would not do and probably just *could* not do it). Seriously, IF there is anyone who feels or felt threatened by me, I seriously regret that. I am not into that kind of workand would rather starve (ok, I don't know how that feels, but ...) than attacking or even threatening someone, his/her family, etc.  Anyway, please, if there is anyone who felt threatened by me (which, if you knew me personally, is rather ridicolous, but of course you have no way of knowing that), TELL ME!This is not an LE thing, they couldn't make this stick anyway, it's probably just a way to get any leverage on me at all, but upon reading this, I really felt bad. I mean, there are people out there who will loose money because of my mistake, THAT i can take, and I hope I can pay them back in a couple of weeks, but this physical threataing thing I really cant stand. I am not a friend of live, live and death are to me like brother and sister, but pain is quite another thing.  So..... Epic moment, for me   let me end this with one of my favorite poems, by: Algernon Charles Swinburne.

We have listened tosellers feedback from here and the forums and with the amount of buyer scams onthe rise we have decided to act. On the 1st of April we will be launching BlackMarket Reloaded 2.0 as a separate site to the main site. This site will beinvite only and work on a web of trust method. As one of our high ranking, trusted sellers we are inviting you to participateand be amongst the few to join. Sellers will be recruited from the main sitewhen we feel they have gained our trust that they are reputable sellers. Buyerswill in the first instance be recruited on their seller stats (min 6 months,minimal refund & disputes, $1500+ sales) thereafter they will only be invited byyou, the sellers. This will be the web of trust working to best effect. We will have a quick ban policy on any scams or scammers and they will not beable to re-join for at least 3 months (If invited again) We are hoping toprovide a safer, more productive site for you, our trusted sellers. We also hopebecause of the way the site will work we will see a better community evolve, andlarger deals being able to be placed. BMR will still run in conjunction with BMR2.0 The Site is due to go live on the 31st of March 2013 with an announcement on theforum at the same time, the reason we have kept it quiet so far is that weexpect a lot of debate about the site on the forum as until sellers begin toinvite their customers the people allowed to join will be limited. We ask thatyou do not mention it to your customers until this time. As a trusted vendor the fee for joining with this invite is 2btc (~$100) afterthe 1st of April the fee will be the same as the main site. Your unique btcaddress to send the payment to is 1BeBwhPo69SYjGEAm46hBCFAXqrpMtonBS . Once the payment has been matched and confirmed you will receive via PM theaddress of the new page with a link to register and build your storefront.please DO NOT release the address until after 31st March.

I sell for a month now on BMR , now i have money on my sellers account but what is the safest way to get it into euro's ? I saw some people that sell euro's on BMR but, do i just need to send my money to my buyers account and then buy the euro's..  but maybe it are customs (police) so they have my adress and they can link the buyers account to the sellers account and then caught me or am i wrong? I have seen that some people offer to clean your BTC ( BTC laundry ) is this the solution ?  Thanks in advance !! Grtzz PabloBelgium",NA

You could pay 20% or get payed 20%, it's that simple! Another option is buying things you can resell, I have been a little dissapointed with my profit margin from most things I have bought for resale, but you can find some items that are a great deal! There are also a few legit sites that sell silver and gold for bitcoins and that is another solid investment and can be pawned for quick cash.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,BocephusMoonbeam,10428,2013-10-23T16:56:00,Topic: TrueCrypt Compromisable by Governments?,Safety,"I ran across this article that seems to imply that government intelligence agencies have at least some capability of breaking TrueCrypt. I guess this is not such a surprise and since TrueCrypt is not truly open, people have been citing its possible vulnerability for some time. However, this is the first instance where I've seen something so telling published in the main stream media. warning *clearnet link*: http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE97T0RC20130830",NA
BlackMarketReloaded Forums,bratac,10428,2013-10-23T17:08:00,Re: TrueCrypt Compromisable by Governments?,Safety,"I wouldn't trust that article so much. They say: ""Goode said the hard drive contained around 60 gigabytes of data, ""of which only 20 have been accessed to date."""" Most likely a partition was not encrypted at all (or encrypted with an easy-to-guess password), and it had 20GB in it, or something like that. Truecrypt's various algorithms are based on sound mathematical principles, and it is _extremely_ _extremely_ unlikely that anyone could break those right now. Besides, if you do manage to break the encryption, it should give you access to the entire disk all in one go (not a part of it - unless, once again, it was a separate partition). However, a recent article showed that, under Windows, the binary version of truecrypt 7 writes what is assumed to be pseudo-random values in a header at the beginning of the disk, while the Linux version writes a series of zeroes at the same place. It has been suggested that the Windows binary version might be compromised and may be writing a key/part of a key/etc. in this location to allow easy decryption by a unknown third party. Thus, if you use Truecrypt under Windows, I would suggest compiling it yourself (version 7, since the code for the previous ones has never been available). Under Linux, I would suggest dropping truecrypt completely anyway since you can use Luks/dm-crypt - both are ""truly"" open and have been audited.",NA

These were encrypted with Truecrypt. The Brazilians attempted to break these for 6 months, and turned them over to the FBI, who unsuccessfully tried to decrypt them for another 12 months,  The key here is choosing a sufficiently strong passphrase.

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,10428,2013-10-24T20:07:00,Re: TrueCrypt Compromisable by Governments?,Safety,"I would say the most likely explanation would be that truecrypts 'hidden volume' function has been used, and the password for the outer container was somehow obtained.  How the total amount of data has been determined at 60 GB is a bit vague. It could be that the partition was 60 GB in size, or that it was considerably larger, but at the point of creation the user chose not to write random data over the entire drive (very time consuming process, but essential for the plausible deniability part of hidden volumes).",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,ben,10428,2013-10-28T21:30:00,Re: TrueCrypt Compromisable by Governments?,Safety,"That would seem to be the case indeed, although you always need to be careful when installing truecrypt from binaries. Especially on windows platforms this is common practice, and you could be fooled into downloading a compromised binary fairly easily.  Once you have malware on your system it would not be hard to re-route the truecrypt domain to a compromised sever offering you both the tainted binary, but also a proper md5/sha1 checksum that is valid for the compromised file. This is also a risk when you compile it from source code though, unless you actually inspect that source code.  I think there is nothing wrong with truecrypt at all, but there are errors people can make. Downloading a compromised version is one, but choosing passphrases that can easily be broken is a much more common problem. There really is no need to muck about with odd characters and such, as long as your passpharse is sufficiently long and hard to socially engineer. Choosing the names of your three children would, for example, be a very bad idea, whereas using 3 random words that can be found in a dictionary would not.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,backopy,429,2012-05-17T13:49:00,Re: Downloading files with Tor,Safety,"When downloading files you've to notice what MIME type are they. That will determine which application opens it and some allow non-tor-side-connections, such as PDF or WMA.If you're under Windows there's a dangerous default Microsoft never care to remove, they have ""Hide extension for known file types"" on and this has been exploited over and over by virus makers with files like: apparently-harmless-file.txt.exeUnder this setup the MIME is Windows Executable (exe), yet with notepad icon attached to it and Windows hiding known extensions, which is the case of the exe, you just happen to see ""apparently-harmless-file.txt"" looking like a plain and harmless text-file. So, to be in the safe side, check if the application needed to open it does any internet connection, like Acrobat. If, like WMA, it may be requiring a license which is ""available"" somewhere in the web, open it with VLC instead of Windows Media Player, WMP will automatically run to fetch that license and... well... that piece of junk doesn't know what Tor is. In this case if VLC shows a mess up like the old encrypted channels over cable TV, then the file will need a license: trash it or it will give out your IP to fetch the license.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,barksdale,11309,2013-10-30T18:10:00,Topic: localbitcoins.com Security Concern,Safety,"Before the fall of SR, I had been using localbitcoins.com to acquire bitcoins. The only payment method I used was pre-paid cards (moneypak, reloadit, etc.), payed in cash at pharmacy/grocery stores. So technically the payment methods were anonymous, but I am worried about other factors that may have put me at risk.    Most of the time I sent the coins to bitcoinfog (a .onion tumbler), then to SR, however the last 2 transfers I made to SR (August-September after the feds had the server image) I was in a rush and sent them DIRECTLY FROM LOCALBITCOINS TO SR. (I know stupid huh?) Even though the payment method was anonymous, what worries me is that when you log into your account on localbitcoins, it lists the IP ADDRESS that you used to log in (mine was at home). Also the e-mail address associated with the account was a g-mail address.    So I'm wondering, since localbitcoins records your IP address, can the feds trace the bitcoins I sent directly to SR back to my localbitcoins wallet? And then match up my localbitcoins wallet with my IP address? The transfers were about $300 or less each time.    If I want to continue sending bitcoins to BMR using localbitcoins with pre-paid cards, what steps should I take to be safe? Tor does not work with localbitcoins (the pages do not open). I'm assuming I can set up a new account, but that wouldn't really matter because of the IP address logging right?   any tips appreciated",NA

If you get scammed like this, there probably is a decision to be made. The vendor may, for example, offer to refund half the bitcoins you paid, scamming you out of half your money, but also giving you half the money back. In such cases it would depend if you go for practical or principal: you can stand your ground and not let such a vendor see a penny, but that would mean that the money is lost to you too.",NA

BlackMarketReloaded Forums,cutcorners,3117,2013-02-09T03:35:00,"Topic: USA new ""Enhanced Driver's License"" = RFID Tracking/Mark of the Beast",Safety,"This is in no way a ""conspiracy theory"" or Biblical prophecy. It is as real as it gets and you will ultimately have no options except submission and compliance. Does your state now require Enhanced Driver's License with RFID chip on all new DL's issued?  If not yet, it is inevitable and right around the corner. Many states already have this technology in place and mandatory. Other states are employing ""pilot"" test areas in certain counties before mandating the whole state to issue. States that refuse to comply will not get federal funding. Basically, this law WHTI (Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative) is a cousin of The Real ID Act as well as The Patriot Act.  Thanks alot Bush Jr, and Obama! Big Brother will now require verification from birth until death. Massive government databases such as SS and SSDI (Social Security Death Index database / aka Death Master File), Vital Records, IRS, Facial Recognition Software, state and federal prison systems, credit files and consumer report files, AVS (Address Verification System), social media, and who know what else will all communicate with each other simultaneously in Real Time in order to verify exactly who you are. Not only that, the RFID embedded in the new DL's as well as passports & some credit cards can pinpoint where you are. Even simple things like using your grocery store rewards card are now traceable and used to enhance your consumer file reports that marketing companies pay next to nothing to obtain. Not to mention cell phone tracking. No more old school tricks such as assuming the identity or committing fraud against a deceased, incarcerated, homeless, or missing person.  No more crossing over the border without all of your personal info simply available at someone's fingertips.  No more hiding from the taxman or claiming IRS tax dependent deductions unless legit. No more evading LE unwanted intrusions (if u don't have your EDL or other WHTI (basically either a passport or EDL) RFID document on your person you can be detained until they obtain proof of your ID. This will be easily done with Facial Recognition Software (btw, Facebook is now using FRT in some primary shopping areas), fingerprints, or DNA. No more protection from ID thieves, lol. The RFID's can be read in mass numbers from 30 feet via a scanner. So, Big Brother claims that the basis of these new requirements is to speed up border crossings since they can scan everyone at once and of course to prevent ""terrorists"" from entering our country. What a joke. My suggestion is that if you want to delay or postpone your EDL, get a replacement asap. 1st, find out if your particular state or county is now embedding this RFID technology and requiring 4 forms of ID. If not, just go and get a replacement license since you lost your old one, lol (just don't give up your old license without RFID). You can also go online to order a new one by mail as long as address matches.  Most states issue new replacements on demand with a new expiration date (dependent upon date issued, usually around 10 years out). So, it would put off the time u have before EDL would be required. If your state or county is already forcing this technology, just make a road trip to neighboring area not yet complying with this new law. Eventually, all states will be required to comply. It is being done in phases right now. Passports already started this back in early 2000's (somewhere around that time) for all new issues. IF u got one before cutoff, u r good until expiration.  Many police departments now use the ability to scan driver license tags in mass. If anything comes up on your scan that has any mismatched info, you will have some explaining to do. They are also increasing employing FRT for routine traffic stops. They use a device or simply a cell phone to snap your pic, run it through FRT, and bam, well over 90% accuracy rate in identifying you as well as your complete history. Also, please be aware that when u get your new EDL, each state communicates with other state's FRT and if u happen to have another DL from another state, especially with a different name lol, you go on hot list. The FRT runs 24/7 comparing photos with any potential matches against millions and millions of pics. Exact matches are made in split seconds. I just don't see any way around all of this new technology. I will leave it to others more technologically proficient to find loopholes in the system that are inevitable. After all, those of a like mind can be very inventive and resourceful if need be  Thanks 4 taking the time to entertain my observations and ""conspiracy theories,"" as those in power would have the masses of ""sheeple"" believe.  The EDL's are most definitely a National ID.

Bungee 54 Forums,9CHr0wYEYSMEPC,73,2013-10-31T22:04:18,Topic: Avoiding SHA-1 / Linux / GPG,Bungee54 Member Assembly/SigSec,"To start, SHA-1 is broken and thus should be avoided. This is according to Schneier and even if he is wrong -- I rather be safe than sorry. Clear net:*****************************************************************************https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html***************************************************************************** Here is another useful link for people. There is no need to reinvent the wheel; here is another post for people this time an excerpt from Apache. Hopefully some one can find it useful.  Clear net:**********************************************************************************http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#key-prefs**********************************************************************************  How To Avoid SHA-1 Use of SHA-1 should now be avoided. Until SHA3 is available, SHA512 or SHA256 should be used instead. SHA512 is stronger than SHA256. Though some old clients lack SHA512 support, switching to SHA512 is recommended since it is more likely to be strong enough bridge the gap until SHA3.Setting Defaults To configure gpg to avoid SHA-1 edit the options in gpg.conf. Options need to be added (or - when they exist - the existing values replaced) for:     cert-digest-algo - the certificate digest used when linking into the web of trust     personal-digest-preferences - the digest used for signing messages     default-preference-list - the default algorithm preferences for new keys To use SHA512 (recommended): personal-digest-preferences SHA512cert-digest-algo SHA512default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed To use SHA256: personal-digest-preferences SHA256cert-digest-algo SHA256default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed Setting Preferences For Existing Keys The digest preferences for each key are set (from the configuration defaults ) when the key is generated. Once the configuration has been updated to avoid SHA-1, all new keys generated will use these defaults. All existing private keys in the ring need to updated to indicate that stronger hashes are preferred.

For example: $ gpg --send-keys F8B7B4FD How To Generate A Strong Key The weaknesses found in SHA-1 threaten all DSA keys and those RSA keys with length less than 2048 bits. Though no realistic attack against those keys have been made public and these keys continue to be useful (and do not need to be revoked), no new keys should be generated which are exposed to this weakness. The next generation of OpenPGP will use SHA-3 when this is ready. It is uncertain how long this process will take. It is likely that 2048 bit RSA keys with SHA256 hash will be strong enough for this interim period - but not certain. For those with 2048 bit RSA keys, the best advice is to wait (after switching to SHA256 or SHA512, of course). All new keys generated should be RSA with at least 4096 bits. Though 8192 bit keys are stronger, they are slower and may be incompatible with some older clients. For the present, 4096 bit RSA should be strong enough for code signing at Apache. To generate RSA keys with length more than 4096 bits, some changes to the source are needed then the procedure for 4096 bits can be followed.Install And Configure GnuPG GnuPG comes in two flavours:     1.x (well known and portable version)     2.x (feature enhanced) To easily generate a 4096 bit RSA signing and encryption key pair with strong digests, use GnuPG version:     2.0.12 (or higher)     1.4.10 (or higher) Once generated, this key can be used with the widely available 1.4.9 and 2.x releases. If the right version of GnuPG is not currently distributed with your platform, it needs to be installed. Note that this version is only required for key generation. So, replacing the version distributed with your platform is not necessary. The new version may be installed just into a working directory just to generate the new key. Start by checking that the installation has worked and that the version is correct, either $ gpg  --version gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later<http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

There is no problem in using other applications at the same time as using Tor Browser. However, if you traffic other data through the tor network you can expose yourself to a ""Bad Apple"" attack. A ""Bad Apple"" attack can reveal your original IP.  As an extra security measure, many people use a VPN. Now, the most controversy is over whether or not you should use VPN->TOR or TOR->VPN. I will leave that open for debate, but personally I think VPN->TOR is more secure. There is a lot more information out there on this topic. Hopefully this has helped you.

If you use TOR to access hidden services and only surf inside the TOR network you do TOR -> VPN ( tunnel TOR throught a VPN ) because you want to make sure that even you are de-anonymized through a javascript exploit or any other exploites your adversary only has access to the VPN IP address. Now if you registered your VPN anonymously and can be sure they do not keep logs you are fine.

I was thinking in terms of encryption layering. As in, the VPN has the out most layer of encryption and TOR the inner most layer, which made me and Calico have flipped definitions. Sorry for the confusion on that.  All in all,  everything Calico said is accurate as far as I know. One note that I want to add about VPN services, do research about the gateway you are using. Depending on the location of the gateway server, you may have more or less privacy. For instance, Switzerland's laws allow for more privacy than American laws (this is what my VPN provider had told me). I think the differences between US and Swiss laws are marginal, but every bit of privacy counts. I think this is an important topic that is rarely touched on. As for the answer to the original question, it depends on what you are doing on Chrome (or any other application). If they exploit your IP and you are not using a VPN, it would not be hard to figure out who you were in most cases. Considering the case where you do use a VPN, then you are trusting your VPN provider at that point to keep you anonymous.

Bungee 54 Forums,Christ,80,2013-11-01T08:36:22,Topic: Setting up TAILS including a persistent volume,Bungee54 Member Assembly/Security,"big thanks to Fallkniven on SRF for this tutorial, this is C & P from the SR Forum: READ ME!!! I'M IMPORTANT!!! ***>>> Pendrivelinux Universal USB Installer has a new ""persistence"" feature in the latest version (1.9.3.6). I have not tried this with Tails yet, as such I will not entertain any questions on how to go about using it until I am satisfied my own knowledge of it is sound. Thanks for your patience and understanding, also, If you have successfully used this ""persistence"" feature in UUI while installing Tails, let us know what happened. <<<***   Tutorial Part 1 - How to install Tails onto a USB drive.------------------------------------------------------------------- Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux. Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked. Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis."" You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.  *** Update: Meatgrinder has posted steps on how to install Tails to a DVD first, then onto a USB from there. Thanks! ****** Update #2: Vegeta has offered a way to install Tails to USB with the use of a virtual machine. Thanks! ****** If any of the links do not work, please PM me and I will update them for you! ****** All of the following links can and should be downloaded through the Tor network! *** 1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key 2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ 3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer    3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer    3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)    3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)    3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)    3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least. 4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive) **** (Steps continue in the next post!) ****  Booting from a USB drive:-------------------------------------If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue. Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar).(Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/ For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can readhttp://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read thishttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/ Any other questions, ask away. or PM.  ;D I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor.

Bungee 54 Forums,Christ,80,2013-11-01T08:37:09,Re: Setting up TAILS including a persistent volume,Bungee54 Member Assembly/Security,"Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You may want to print this text out on paper for easier reference.  *** (Continued from first post!) *** 5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional. 7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.     7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""         7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)         7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.     8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required. 9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)     9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!"" characters   )         9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.         9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.     10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.     11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).     Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)  You are now finished! Feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications, log into the SR forum and let us know you're using Tails.

I order large packages (illicit, and legal) so im going to opt for the biggest sized box they've got at the PO. keep in mind, i would be getting a box at a USPS PO box, not UPS or FedEx. I've tried looking for an independent PO box provider but they dont have the box im looking for so im forced to go with USPS.  Now to get a USPS PO Box you must present TWO FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION:1.) State issued ID and 2.) either a voter registration card, proof of insurance, or proof of mortgage.  I've got an ID what im missing is the second form of ID. im gonna show them a voter registration card, now this might present a problem since i was reading on the SR forums someone suggested that when you get a PO box, to sign up for it by showing a fake id with a fake name and fake documents. but if i do that, that means i have to get a scan of an id and a voter registration card since ive got no insurance or mortgage lol, so what do i do? just sign up with my real name? i mean im going to be discreet. im going to be ordering a bunch of junk mail, coupons, catalogs and such so it seems i get regular mail to avoid raising suspicion. i plan on checking the box weekly, even when ive ordered nothing again to avoid suspicion. so what should i do?please share your thoughts, suggestions, advice.thank you. -Amidamaru",NA

Bungee 54 Forums,mynameisbob,137,2014-01-06T20:41:13,Re: Receiving Packages Safely ,Bungee54 Member Assembly/Security,"As far as I'm aware of (and I've done extensive research, but obviously I may not know everything) it's simply a matter of knowing that one way works for sure, and not knowing much about another option (ie. post office boxes). Vendors know that sending to a home address isn't risky, they know everyone does it, they know that success rates are very high. Vendors don't have the same statistics for post office boxes, or private rented out boxes, or etc. Not to mention in every receiving country each one of these things may have different laws, and therefore different success rates. From my research a P.O. box is just as safe as a private address, if not more so. For smaller amounts I would argue that a P.O. box is much safer than a normal address because a controlled delivery requires a lot of manpower and planning. If we look at how a controlled delivery works, we know that in a normal package delivery to a house, the person normally checks their mail/receives the package in a fairly small timeframe, therefore taking up little of the postal inspector's (and his personnel's) time and resources. However, if a small amount is sent to a post office and is intercepted, one could only be checking the P.O. box at irregular intervals of about a week. The postal inspector most likely will not waste tens of thousands of dollars on keeping a team (and himself, from what I've read the postal inspector must be there at all times to accompany a package with illicit materials) to wait a week in order to hand you the package and then search you. This of course all gets thrown away once you're ordering bulk. You start getting kilograms of drugs in the mail they won't hesitate to spend a little bit more money to wait around for you. I'm not a lawyer, nor are these statements true for everywhere, make sure your research is done for your specific country.",NA
Bungee 54 Forums,9CHr0wYEYSMEPC,137,2014-01-06T21:14:04,Re: Receiving Packages Safely ,Bungee54 Member Assembly/Security,"Agreed^ The thing you should think about before opening it up is the following...Who will be picking up the package from the PO Box. It will be either you or someone else. Now lets say you are. Opening it up with a fake ID would be a terrible, terrible idea. Say they end up doing a controlled delivery. You will probably lose plausible dependability. Like really, what other reason could you be using a fake ID for and opening PO Box, nothing legal... Plus, they will tack on a felony. Even if someone else picks up the gear from the PO Box that you opened with a fake, they will have your face on camera, which wont serve too well for you. (Unless you find somewhere else other than USPS that wont have you on camera. Or with persuasion will wave your ID requirement). Next option is having someone else pick up the packages. This one is probably the more secure choice if you are decisively going to use a PO Box. There a few ways you could probably do this.... Have the pick up person open the box with their ID. Have the pickup person open the PO Box with the fake you got them. (At that point you would only have to worry about your pickup person setting you up : /   )  If you have a pickup person, you can just have it mailed to their house/apartment/condo/box-in-alley. As long as their place is clean, they and you have nothing to worry about. This is probably your best bet. Just make sure they know their legal rights and make sure you have your communications under lock and key. For bulk controlled delivery in America... it probably wouldn't be surprising that they wire tapped your drop, prior to the controlled delivery. 'Merica!",NA

Hosting With Nginx Or As A Customer! ,"Bungee54 Member Assembly/Software, hardware, web resources & tools","A computer that sits in your hand and works off a 9V battery! any response or ideas would help! google around and you find stuff on the Raspberry Pi. its an amazing piece of hardware. its crazy how $45 can make the difference. we have all these people using windows computers knowing the risks. Windows is not good in this game. it can brake you fast. but $45 wont. i have been working on a set-up where you don?t have to know Linux  . all the brain work is done for you. Linux is open source every thing i have done in this image can be done and i will have a complete breakdown a and ""how to guide"". the image is done. just a couple tweaks.  im am not the best write. but i will copy and pate details here as to what i got and what i have done to the Raspian Image to make it Tor worthy. Raspberry Pi SetupHardware: Raspberry Pi $50Case $9Wifi Dongle $5Wireless Keyboard & Mouse  $30* Prepaid Wireless Broadband.  Hotspot $70- $90  Plans $10 - $50 Never Expires  (Depending on Area and Usage) Pre-Configured Software: 1 Yr VPN Service $40TorIceweasel ( Browser Configured For Tor)I2P ** Chromium  (UnSafe Browsing)TorChatBitMessage GPA (Pgp Program)*** Safe-Mail.Net Email **** Enigmail (Pop3 PGPed Email), Rss Feed Will be implemented. *****Pidgin Chat (Pre Configured)  Notes: Hardware can be bought on-line. However buying through us will make setup easier and the whole system can be tested before getting to your door.  Software can be installed and configured by you. We by no means require you to use our Wheezy Image. We offer it set up to take ?most? the headache away. Nothing will be built. IE... TorChat will not be open before shipping meaning when you open TorChat it will generate a new ID only you know. PGP no key will be made for you, when you get it you will make your own private key.Email & Pidge These will be configured you will be required to change the password And Or make a new account for both.  Astric Side Notes  * BroadBand:  All hotspot plans are different depending on the provider and location. The best one I was able to find offers the hot-spot for $10 and the plans don't expire,  $10 gets you 500MB, $25 is 1.5GB, $45 is 3GB.  An Idea on data usage, there is 1000Kb in 1MB a Email (just Text) is About 30KbThat would be about 17k email, if your talking Just TorChat thats 40k-50k Messages. Note this is only using it for communication. We strongly encourage you to use it only to communicate with us or your vendor. ** Chromium this is installed for you to browse the normal web. But it is highly discouraged. The Raspberry Pi should only be used for Market related ?Stuff? its best not to log into email and personal websites while on the Pi and Hotspot. *** Safe-Mail, A Safe-Mail.Net email will be created for you, it will be a anonymous and randomly generated email which will then be upgraded to a VIP account. We encourage you to change the password after getting your Pi ****  Enigmail, Your safemail email will be connected to this however when you chance your password and create your new private key these will need to be set up on Enigmail afterwards, (I will more then likely have video guides on these actions)  We will soon have a RSS Feed connected to our website this will let US and vendors update customers about upcoming Promotions, News, & Upgrades    ***** Pidgin, You will have a ICQ Setup on this and it will run through Tor. We encourage you to change your password on this also . This will be the emergency Form of contact.  If Tor did ever get taken down there will be a video on how to disable tor on this and run it straight through your VPN and  HotSpot, These messages sit on a server. Which is why we dont use it unless we need to. Most vendors will not turn this on unless there as been a hiccup in the other forms of communication, IE email goes down, Tor Stops Working, A Market Place Crashed,  or if something on there end Crashes. ICQ is easily recovered by any computer so it can be pulled up quickly. But it is much less secure.",NA

Bungee 54 Forums,9CHr0wYEYSMEPC,30,2013-10-16T06:53:11,Topic: Repost from Back Flag user Apotheosis on PGP keys,Bungee54 Member Assembly/SigSec,"This place has only been up for a short time, with a handful of users, and yet I am already seeing the same kinds of issues that were all too prevalent on Silk Road. I am referring to people using broken PGP software, such as GPG4Win/Kleopatra. Thankfully there have been no users (at least yet) that are using abominations like Portable PGP. A little background, if I may: In the Fall of 2009, a new standard format for PGP keys was adopted, to deal with potential vulnerabilities. The original format, was to use a single RSA key for both signing and encryption. When PGP 5.x came out, they changed formats to the DSA/ElGamal keys. The DSA refers to the Digital Signature Algorithm, which specifies a key of 1024-bits in the standard. The Elgamal encryption key was based in the discrete log problem, instead of RSA. The reason for abandoning RSA at that time was not due to security, but the fact that RSA was patented. (The patents expired in 2000 or 2001). Fast forward to 2009. 1024-bit keys are looking increasingly shaky, so the PGP and GPG developers decided to abandon the DSA/Elgamal key format, because the DSA standard calls for a 1024-bit key. They made the decision to return to the RSA key format, but there was a complication by this time. A year or two earlier, it was shown that RSA keys used for both signing and encryption could potentially leak some of the private key bits, making the keys easier to break. Accordingly, it was decided to adopt a dual-RSA key format, with the primary key used for signing, and an encryption sub-key used only for encryption. It was also decided at that time, to raise the default keysize to 2048-bits. For reasons that I simply cannot fathom, Kleopatra's designers seem to be unwilling (or unable) to fix the problem with their software generating less secure, non-standards-compliant keys.  How you can tell which type of key you have is to open up a terminal window/dos box, and type in the following command: gpg --list-keys (name or key-id) E.g.: gpg --list-keys apotheosispub   4096R/2C566E21 2013-10-06uid                  Apotheosis <Apotheosis@BF>sub   4096R/FFA78AAF 2013-10-06 gpg --list-keys metadprpub   2048R/0C4E8598 2013-10-03uid                  metadpr <anon@anon.com> You can see that my key has an encryption sub-key, whereas metadpr's does not. Finally, people should be using 4096-bit PGP keys. The various journalists working on the Edward Snowden NSA revelations are using 4096-bit keys, including noted cryptographer Bruce Schneier. If 4096-bit keys are good enough for them, then they should be good enough for us.

This action was not without controversy -- the revoked keys left large holes in the Web of Trust at that time. Here is what Schneier stated this in response to Lucky Green's announcement:    ""To me, the big news in Lucky Green's announcement is not that he   believes that Bernstein's research is sufficiently worrisome as to   warrant revoking his 1024-bit keys; it's that, in 2002, he still   has 1024-bit keys to revoke."" In that same issue of Crypto-Gram, Schneier writes: Way back in 1995, I estimated key lengths required to be secure from different adversaries: individuals, corporations, and governments (Applied Cryptography, 2nd Edition, table 7.6, page 162). Back then I suggested that people migrate towards 1280-bit keys, and even 1536-bit keys, if they were concerned about large corporate or government adversaries: Recommended Public-Key Key Lengths (in bits)Year                   Ind.   Corp.   Govt.1995          768   1280   15362000         1024   1280   15362005         1280   1536   20482010         1280   1536   20482015         1536   2048   2048 See: https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0204.html That was written in 2002 -- almost 12 years ago, now. You can see that in 1995, some 18 years ago now, a 768-bit key was considered the minimum size to protect against attack by INVIDIDUALS, not governments or corporations. A 512-bit key is weaker, by far, by several orders of magnitude. Remember, as I said in my other post, 512-bit keys were being broken on spare machines that people had laying about the office more than a decade ago. The National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST) required all U.S. government agencies to stop using 1024-bit keys after the end of December 2010 -- that was damn near 3 full years ago.

Securing windows is like trying to defend yourself with two broken arms -- very difficult even if you know what your doing. As for Linux users, make sure you create a sub-key if you sign things with your key. @Jumper To start, it depends if you are using Linux or Windows and the program you choose to use. As for password security, it should contain the following :A-Za-z0-9Special characters (ie !@#$%^^&*(){[}]\\|;:'"",<.>/?`~-_=+  )As for the length of the password, I knew a database manager for a large company and their password had to be at least 32 characters. You had to have at least six characters from each category as well. Keep in mind, this is for a high level of security. However, it is not hard to achieve (ie Th3.N0rlax.SLEPTz,b4/I~Arr1v3D!:3   ).

Imagine LEO scanning your internet usage they only find you using a VPN ..then the subpoena the VPN but even there are no logs about TOR usage... of course DeepPacketInspection might thwart all of that...but there is still obfs-proxy ^^  But again...in your case it is probably much much more important to choose vendors who use MBB's and know what they do.

Notes:Drugs travel North and East and money travels South and West. Slow rolling is when the police officer slows down, because they want you to pass them. Remember to just act like everyone else. Pass, look at the officer, and look back at the road. Do not speed while doing the previous. Despite what they say, a police officer's job is to profile you. Play to your strengths to look innocent. **********************************************Searches: Whether or not to consent to a search. This part is controversial. So, I recommend going by your own preference. The dilemma is if you do not consent, it is generally a sign that you have something to hide or you are trying to stick it to them. Ultimately, it is up to you. Here are my thoughts.  If they ask if they can search your vehicle, I would respond with the question ""am I free to leave."" From here, things can go a few different ways. The first is you are free to leave. Say no, then say you are going on your marry way! This will usually be after you have received your ticket/citation. This is also the most likely case. The second is you are not free to leave. This could be for a few reasons, you have not signed your ticket/citation or they have probable cause to search your vehicle or reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed.  The early is less likely to happen, because in court it can be seen as coercing you into agreeing to a search of your vehicle. However, it can happen. Often, a defendant challenges a search on the grounds that consent was not voluntary, only to have a police officer testify to a conflicting version of events that establishes valid consent. In these conflict situations, judges tend to believe police officers unless defendants can support their claims through the testimony of other witnesses or video.  If you are not free to leave, then they have a reasonable suspicion/probable cause and can detain you. If you do not consent to a search, then they will probably ask why. The canned response should be, ?I've been advised by an attorney never to consent to a search.? However, they can do a weapons pat down of the interior of the car if they ?suspect? you are armed. This consists of a search of  you, the driver's compartment, the glove box, and underneath the seats. Essentially, do not stash anything illicit in these places.  If they already have probable cause to search your vehicle (eg it smells like weed), then they will end up searching your vehicle anyway. If you know that they have probable cause already (eg it smells like weed), but everything is stashed well, you want to consent to the search. The search is more likely to be less thorough, when you consent to a search.  In general:There are pro's and con's to consenting to a search. If you do not consent, then they will probably go on the radio and say ?we have a refusal.? Then, the whole department will want to come and see if they can find probable cause to search the vehicle. All they need is a reasonable suspicion to detain you (eg rubber bans around the gear shifter, a weed pendent in the mirror, scale and baggies in the back seat).  Be careful about casual consent. That is, if you are stopped by the cops and you get out of the car, but don't close the door, they can search the car and claim that they though you were indicating consent by leaving the door ajar. Also, if you say, ""I'd rather you didn't search,"" they can claim that you were reluctantly giving them permission to search. Always just say the magic words: ""I do not consent to this search.""  When choosing whether or not to consent to a search, you are choosing the option that is less likely to get you criminal charges.   **********************************************************Festival Specific: Article by the Festival Lawyer  What should you do? 1. Like the Clash said, ?Know Your Rights.? Okay, quick criminal procedure tutorial. In any encounter with the police, a Judge will be looking after the fact at whether the police had a right to stop you in the first place. This is because the 4th Amendment of the Constitution says that you have a right as a citizen to freely go about your business unless the police can show they had a belief you were engaged in criminal activity. What the police have to show to a Judge later depends completely on whether the Judge finds that you were being ?arrested?, ?detained? or were ?free to leave?. If the police arrest you, they have to show they had ?Probable Cause? to believe you were committing a crime. On the other hand, the police will probably argue that they weren?t arresting you but just ?detaining? you. A ?detention? is a situation where the police stop you briefly while they investigate a crime but haven?t arrested you yet. In a detention, the police have a much lower burden of proof. They only have to show a ?reasonable suspicion? as to why they were detaining you. Or the police may argue that their entire contact with you was just a ?consensual encounter? where you were free to go at anytime. In a consensual encounter, they don?t really need to justify why they stopped you because they were just talking to you and you were ?free to leave?, (Because people always feel free to walk away when contacted by the police, right?) 2. Remember the Festival Lawyer?s Key Phrases. So knowing the above, what should you do If a cop stops you? The first question out of your mouth should be, ?Am I being detained?? Then, ?Why? What am being stopped for? Am I free to go, or am I under arrest?? Memorize this. Repeat it out loud: ?Am I being detained? Why? Am I free to go, or am I under arrest?? Yes I am aware that like the cop in 99 Problems, the cop may not appreciate you being so ?sharp as a tack? and view you as a potential troublemaker. So your job in this situation is to keep calm and cool. Be respectful but clear and firm in what you are saying. It is completely reasonable (and legal) to ask why you are being stopped and whether you are free to go. By asking from the start if you are under arrest or free to leave you are forcing the officer to tell you exactly what is happening and whether you are a suspect. 3. Miranda Rights Myths vs. Reality One of the most common urban myths out there is that the police have to read you your Miranda rights or the arrest gets thrown out of court. Not true. The police don?t have to read you these rights. In fact, the police have the right to completely lie to you in any interview. The only time they have to read Miranda rights is if: A) You are under arrestB) They want to use a statement you made after being arrested in court against you. The Right against Self Incrimination is in the Bill of Rights for a reason. USE IT. You should NEVER give a statement to the police without a lawyer. Period. No exceptions. In the above scenario, questions like ?whose backpack is this?? should be answered with a firm, ?Officer, I am choosing to remain silent. I want a lawyer.? 4. Do not give the authorities consent to search you. One other major Constitutional right you have is the right to be free from an unlawful search of your person and property. So lets say you are already in a Festival when the police approach you. They won?t let you leave and ask for permission to search your backpack. (Obviously, security has a right to search you as you enter a festival and go through their initial security screening.) Cops always make it seem like you?re some kind of a criminal if you express the slightest hesitation about having your property searched without a warrant. You can expect to hear an ?If you have nothing to hide, why can?t we search your stuff?? type of verbal approach from the cops. Know this?If the police are asking you permission to search you or your property, it usually means they know they are making an illegal search. Let that sink in for a second. When the police ask you ?Can I search this bag??, they KNOW they are asking you to let them make a search they are not legally entitled to make. My advice? Respectfully tell the police officer, ?I?m not giving you consent to search my property.? If they ask what you have to hide, don?t argue with them. Simply say again, ?Officer, I?m sorry I?m not giving you consent to search my person or my property. If I?m free to leave I?d like to leave. If not, I?d like a lawyer please?? At this point, they can still search you if they have probable cause, but what you?ve done with your statements is make them declare their reason for doing so and force them to show they are legally entitled to search you. 5. Document the Encounter. In future columns we are going to talk a lot about what a Festival Buddy is and what their responsibilities are. In this scenario, the Festival Buddy?s job isn?t to yell ?Hey man leave him alone? or drunkenly argue with the cops. Festival Buddy?s job is to whip out his or cell phone and document the entire encounter. SPOILER ALERT ? COPS REALLY FREAKING HATE THIS. The best thing to happen to Civil Liberties in this country was the invention of the cell phone camera and YouTube. But just bear in mind, cops will do just about anything to avoid having you upload your video of them on YouTube or on Social Media. This is an area where your own comfort level has to dictate how far you push it. Legally, since you are in a public place you are completely entitled to film and record what is happening. But cops will sometimes argue that you are ?interfering with an investigation? and threaten to arrest you. Or if you have had anything to drink they will suddenly decide that you are ?publicly intoxicated? and try to arrest you. As a Festival Buddy you have to decide if you can safely film what is happening. That?s because your other job as FB is to stay out of custody and post bail and let your buddy?s family know he just got arrested. I suggest that you say the following if cops order you to turn off your camera. ?Officer, I?m not interfering with you in any way. I am just documenting this arrest. This is a public place and I?m entitled to record this?. While making this statement, I would make a show of backing up and getting out of the way to prove that you are not interfering but just observing. If that doesn?t work and your Latin is good you can just tell them, ?Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (pssst?that?s a joke but go ahead and Google it kids) If things get crazier, be sure to get footage of the cop screaming ?turn that camera off? before you turn it off. Everyone (You Tube, Media, Juries, Internal Affairs) loves footage of cops screaming ?turn off that camera? to a calm person who is doing nothing but saying ?I?m not interfering, just watching to make sure you are following the law.?*****************************We wanted some peer review and thoughts before submitting this as an article.

OMG there is no way you can get drugs through the mail with out customs or the police finding out!!!         A. The majority of drug mail is not intercepted. There is always a risk that it could be intercepted though. We are researching and designing various interception detection systems to help counter the risk of this. The probability of your mail being intercepted (if it is properly packaged) depend significantly on your location and the location the product is being shipped from. Domestic packages are very rarely intercepted. International packages are uncommonly-rarely intercepted, depending on your specific country and the specific country the package is coming from. Some drugs (Weed) are more likely to be intercepted than others (LSD). Also, there are tons of legal research chemicals that you could get if you are afraid of risking an illegal order. So, you can still trip with out any of the legal risks. Please check the laws in your area before ordering a research chemical if you are worried about ordering illegal substances.                   The Developmental Smuggling Model         Phase One         Move drugs mostly with in a single country    Move drugs primarily for personal use, and use of close friends, not primarily for profit    Mostly inexperienced smugglers    Very loose organizations of friends    High probability of being caught    Bring small amounts of drugs into country, if any, often move drugs within nation borders    Small groups of friends, often pool their resources for bulk discounts    Members usually grew up together in the same geographic area,  some of them may have moved to new areas with out the specific goal of smuggling    Often are addicted to drugs    Very strong sense of loyalty to fellow members leads to low rates of cooperation with LE and less snitching than phase II    Often see themselves as oppressed by society, hold the common belief and wish for all drugs to be legalized    Extended period of time between drug runs    Inherently unstable over time, often busted as they are the primary phase targeted by law enforcement    Often preyed upon by more experienced higher phase smugglers    Not likely to be oriented to any foreign countries traveled to in order to obtain drugs         Phase Two         Profit is more of a motivation, networks supplied are significantly larger and less close knit than phase I networks    Have acquaintance level relationships with other smuggling networks and smugglers    Put strong emphasis on gaining larger networks and obtaining more and better sources for contraband    Put strong emphasis on gaining good reputation within their network    phase II networks frequently discuss trust issues among themselves and assure each other their unwillingness to snitch, despite having high snitch rates    Have the potential to become phase III organizations if they continue to develop with out detection by law enforcement    Organizations tend to be detected by law enforcement with in 3-5 years, with a mild risk of dissolving in this time frame if they do not advance to phase III    Utilize rudimentary intelligence techniques, such as surveillance on ports of entry    Utilize basic counter-profiling techniques, such as administration of anti-anxiety drugs to reduce behavioral signs associated with nervousness    Sacrifice naive mules to divert attention: for example tricking phase I mules into smuggling insecurely to divert attention while the true mules slip through    deal with dedicated phase III brokers but lack organization, funding and skill to work directly with phase III networks    Begin to develop rudimentary specialized skills such as dedicated money launderers, intelligence and counter intelligence, mules, etc    Begin to skillfully recruit new members rather than dealing fully with long time friends and associates    High demands are placed on reliability and reputation becomes very important to sustain contacts with other phase II smugglers and networks    Sometimes are groups of close friends evolving from phase I, often are more loosely affiliated by being members of the same gang or ""lifestyle""    Often use legitimate employment to benefit smuggling (airline stewardesses, long haul truck drivers), work smuggling route into business route    Often times create businesses for the purpose of smuggling drugs, or transform legitimate businesses into drug smuggling businesses    Usually members are career criminals focusing on smuggling, rather than people with no other criminal history who specialize in smuggling    Due to strong trust concerns members often are required to commit serious crimes not always necessarily related to drug smuggling in order to gain trust    Regular shipments of drugs and drug runs, often following a pattern to minimize any potential dry time    Some phase II smugglers are independent contractors with no solid ties to any one trafficking organization    More likely to be willing to resort to extreme violence with other groups and with each other to settle disputes    Some phase II smugglers are likely to become combative with law enforcement ie: shoot outs, attacking police officers, etc    Mild risk of being caught, most phase II organizations are identified and targeted by law enforcement after three to five years of activity    Often have dedicated lawyers being paid in drug money    Sometimes begin bribing low level officials    Focus on smuggling, but some phase II smugglers also sell at street level themselves    Often have troubled pasts with family issues and legal trouble    Likely use drugs but are not as likely to be addicted as phase I smugglers    Often have high school diplomas and some technical training and college but rarely have any college degrees    Many phase II smugglers have military experience, although they often have some infractions on their record for rule violations              Phase Three         use smuggling as primary source of income    extensive experience with smuggling    dynamic and flexible networks    Organization creates firmly held dedicated roles for members such as: pilots, intelligence and counter intelligence, money launderers, etc    Phase III smugglers have often wanted to be smugglers for a long time, such as from child hood    Usually come from families where smuggling activity is encouraged or at least found to be acceptable    Typically phase III smugglers and networks are strictly business with very little personal interaction between members and organizations    Often times are ruthless and willing to order assassinations to meet their needs    Most vulnerable to attack when leaders or others in positions of power leave and need to be replaced    Phase III smugglers often wish to generate large sums of money and then retire into legitimate business    Have access to very large international distribution networks, do contracting with ethnic based phase III producers to distribute products    phase III producers often have strong ties to a single country, handle a very specific type of contraband and have strictly business interactions    Often work with multiple ethnic groups and handle the distribution of product from source to customer and distribution of cash from customer to source    Sometimes phase III smugglers have legitimate corporations with offices in multiple countries    Use sophisticated intelligence and counterintelligence techniques to both protect the group from law enforcement and to minimize lost product    Often subcontract 'operations' to multiple phase III specialty groups, including money laundering, transportation, intel and counter intel, etc    Often have dedicated contacts with groups that professionally manage bribes of government officials    Use military grade technology and equipment to assist in smuggling    Vacuum seal shipments of drugs, often using science to determine the time it will take for the substance in the vac bag to permeate the bag    Distribute transportation over large networks of mules moving smaller amounts (swarming), although they are responsible for the largest amount of overall drugs brought into a country.    Very rarely move the drugs themselves but contract out to phase II and sometimes I via brokers, although there are some phase III mules as well.    Have group logos, often putting them on shipments of drugs    Participate in intensive intelligence gathering on law enforcement agencies    It is not uncommon for phase III smugglers and networks to do independent contracting for legitimate governments, utilizing black market skills for  covert government operations    In depth knowledge of law enforcement techniques used against smugglers         A distinguishing hallmark of the Phase-III network is that there is discussion within the group about what to do when it becomes apparent that the organization is under surveillance by law enforcement. This is significantly different from phase I and II smugglers, who are unlikely to be aware they are under government surveillance until they are arrested.         Have the lowest rate of drug addiction (and use), but they do likely have other addictions such as gambling, prostitutes, etc    Typically have above average to superior IQs    Frequently make use of forged documentation and stolen identities    sometimes have contacts in government agencies         Often have college degrees in business or political science, high ranking military careers or training in intelligence and counter intelligence, although some merely advanced through the phases from phase I to phase III and acquired their skills on the job         Are aware of law enforcement profiling techniques and smuggling models    Increase amounts of phase one and two smugglers in order to drain resources of law enforcement    Promote unsafe methods of smuggling to phase one and two smugglers in order to increase bust rates and drain law enforcement resources    Actively promote false information in an attempt to create biased profiles from the perspective of law enforcement    Specialize in a narrow range of contraband, often outsource from phase II and other phase III groups to get different sorts    Very rarely busted by law enforcement, when individual members are busted very rarely snitch and often vehemently deny everything              Routes are Networks             When contraband is moved over distance (from Alice to Bob) it takes a certain route to get to that location. Routes are particularly important as the route a drug shipment takes has a large say in how likely it is to be intercepted or not. Different countries have customs that operate at vastly different efficiencies. Packages from some locations to other locations are flagged. This is largely country dependent and a comprehensive list of countries that are good to ship from to other countries would require extensive intelligence gathering and analysis and is outside of the scope of this website. Some countries are notoriously hard to smuggle into or through, for example Australia is known for (allegedly) checking 100% of inbound shipments for drugs and other contraband.                  Some countries are particularly known for outbound drug shipments, for example Columbia. Shipments from these countries are likely to be scrutinized. Developing ideal trafficking routes is a complex and dynamic task; as new routes are identified by authorities they must change to avoid unacceptable levels of interception. Countries can be used to proxy drugs, perhaps shipments from Aliceland are suspicious in Bobistan, but common to Carroleria. By shipping from Aliceland to Carroleria and Carroleria to Bobistan interception rates can be drastically decreased.             Swarming product can drastically reduce the percentage of intercepted product. If Bob orders 1kg of substance from Alice, instead of sending a 1KG shipment to Bob all at once Alice can break it up into ten 100 gram packages. Bob can open ten boxes with fake IDs (or better yet, Bob can have ten associates located in his country open one box each, and pay them for getting parts of the shipment). Now a single interception will not compromise the entire kilogram, rather 100 grams is the most that can be lost with a single interception. There is no longer a single end point for the authorities to monitor, rather there are ten. This greatly decreases risk of total interception and greatly increases potential costs of end point surveillance. After the ten shipments of 100 grams make it into the target country they can be recombined by Bob, perhaps through country internal shipments or dead drops. Bob would be particularly smart to hire lower phase smugglers to do dead drop and mail box pick ups, Bob can use technology to do surveillance on the pick ups so he can identify if one of his operatives is compromised (more on this later). Bob does not even need to hold the drugs himself at any point, he can contract this out to lower phase smugglers and only worry about picking up finances and dealing with potentially malicious mules. Bob and Alice must carefully consider the risks of increasing shipment frequency (more packages to make it through customs) with the benefits (less chance any of the ten will be compromised, a single compromise is less of a problem, etc). If Bob contracts lower phase smugglers for pick ups and selling and never touches the product himself, swarming has no real disadvantages for him. The new benefits of Bitcoin make this method of smuggling particularly ideal. Bob is wise to invest in a large amount of product from Alice, to be swarmed to many of his contacts through out a country or the world. Now Bob only needs to worry about anonymously getting money, which is made easy by a combination of Bitcoin and mixing. This gives us three primary roles in the organization: investor (pays for product from producer or distributor to be swarmed through out his network), producer (produces drugs for sale to Bob), distributor[to various degrees away from the producer] (picks up and sells drugs for Bob in a localized area, for part of the profit).                   Securing Drop Points             Securing drop points involves creating a perimeter around them in an attempt to detect manned surveillance. There are two scenarios; pick up teams and solo pick ups. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of team pick ups include ability to do real time perimeter monitoring during the pick up. Disadvantages include having a team know about you and the pick up in the first place. Only very trusted people should be part of pick up teams with each other. Advantages of solo pick ups are lack of required trust in a team. Disadvantages are inability to do real time perimeter monitoring.              Pick up surveillance teams can communicate with encrypted walkie talkies. The individual doing the actual physical pick up may prefer an ear piece.                            Google Earth or really any map can be used to determine the optimal positioning of a surveillance team. If a drop is in the middle of various intersections, having eyes on the street can give an early alert to the pick up agent if unfriendly vehicles approach. Guaranteed reaction times (time to flee after a malicious entity is detected approaching) can be  more or less assured if all possible routes of entry are guarded.                       Even if a pick up team is not possible or desired, counter-surveillance around drop area is suggested. Look for people who seem to be doing surveillance. It is best to make a pick up when there is no other person around for quite some area.",NA

Latex gloves should not be used by themselves, they are so thin that if any debris (including dust) gets on them, you will leave debris impressions of your fingerprints on what you touch. Tight fitting gloves made out of cloth or some other material should be utilized. During the stage of packaging where you come in contact with the substance, latex gloves should be worn over the regular gloves. After the substance is vacuum sealed, the latex 'over gloves' should be removed and disposed of before coming into contact with the outer parts of the packaging, to avoid contaminating it with trace amounts of the substance. Substances can be double or even triple vac sealed, with scrubs of the outer vac bag at each stage to reduce the chances of residue contamination. It may be possible to further reduce a dogs ability to smell a package by vac sealing the substance and the placing this bag into another vac seal bag filled with activated carbon and vac sealing this. Keep in mind that activated carbon could substantially increase the weight of the package and if it is an improvement over using just a vac bag or not remains to be determined.             After the substance is properly vacuum sealed it must be prepared for shipping. There are numerous ways to disguise drug packages. The closer that a package looks to a standard envelope the less likely it is to be seized. The goal is to blend into a crowd. Boxes are more likely to be intercepted than envelopes. Breaking an order up into multiple smaller amounts that can fit into envelopes may be the best plan even if it involves more packages going through the system.             Hairnets and long sleeved clothing should be worn during all stages of packaging to prevent hairs and other forensic trace evidence from entering the package. Sealing should not be done with saliva for the same reasons.  Packages should not be sent from inside post offices but from random drop boxes away from cameras and buildings with cameras. Some care should none the less be taken to disguise facial features and identifying marks. Keep in mind that the total weight of a package sent via one of the drop off boxes, at least in the United States, is 13 ounces or less.             If a shipment is so large that trojaning is required, there are some things to keep in mind. First of all, it seems that customs may have lists of common products. If you make a product up and use it to disguise drugs it may actually stick out. For example one seized shipment of a liquid drug was hidden in bottles with the title 'gay lube oil'. The bottles were made to look like a legitimate product but the smugglers would have probably been better off using a real product container, emptying it out then filling it with the drugs, and repackaging it.             For particularly large shipments of stable drugs it may be best to create pottery  (or similar items) out of the product and a binding material. Once the product arrives the dishes can be smashed to powder and the intended substance extracted. This is particularly useful for drugs that dogs are not trained to smell, coke smugglers have done it before as well but its use is limited in this case as a dog can hit on it still.              General Mail Info             When deciding what mail company to ship with there are some things to keep in mind. Within the USA, USPS delivers over 100 billion pieces of standard mail, 95 billion pieces of first class mail , 1 billion packages, 900 million pieces of priority mail, and 54 million pieces of express mail a year. Internationally USPS delivers 830 million pieces of mail a year. Including periodicals and other special mailings, USPS handles approximately 213 billion pieces of mail a year total. FedEx handles slightly under two billion pieces of mail total per year, UPS handles around 5.3 billion a year. USPS clearly handles vastly more mail than FedEx or UPS, and this means that your package has a larger crowd to blend into. If every single person in the USA inspected a piece of USPS mail every single day, under half the daily volume of USPS mail would be inspected.             Within USA, USPS needs a warrant to open your mail if it is sent first class. UPS and FedEx do not require a warrant to open and inspect your packages. Although law enforcement technically needs a warrant to inspect UPS or FedEx packages, in practice they do not as UPS and FedEx will in all cases cooperate with LE. The requirement of a warrant to open your packages reduces the chances that your package will be intercepted. Perhaps a judge doesn't think they have enough evidence to open your package. Perhaps someone who would otherwise open a package on a whim will not open your package because they don't feel like going through the steps of getting a warrant and are going to look for another package they find more likely to have contraband in it. When a package is going through customs, warrants are not be required.             The best option for recipients is to use PO boxes or PMBs obtained with fake identification. Another excellent option is to have packages sent to abandoned buildings or houses. The same security methods should be applied as when using a fraudulently obtained mail box. When possible use in state identification. Mom and Pop box companies often have poor security compared to franchises, for example they are less likely to require photocopies of the ID and also are less likely to have a camera system, or if they do have a camera system it is probably very poor quality as compared to a big franchise company. Recipients using PO/PM boxes should wait for a lengthy yet random period of time after the package arrives to attempt retrieval. This waiting period decreases the chances of being apprehended and potentially wastes law enforcement resources, prolonged manned surveillance is very expensive.             If you are worried about a photocopy of you ID being taken when you open a box, spray hair spray over the face of the card. This will not catch the human eye but will cause the photocopy to be distorted and poor quality. I also suggest if you get a fake ID that you edit your picture slightly in photoshop, slightly change the distance between your eyes and nose. This will prevent someone with a photocopy of your fake ID from finding you by running through the legitimate drivers license database with facial recognition technology.             Disguising efforts should be utilized when retrieving packages (wearing gloves or covering finger tips with liquid band-aid, is a requirement) and test runs should also be attempted. See the 'chapter' on secure drop points for more information on how to secure a pick up.            Do not park near the box place you are using. At the very least park a block away and walk to it. A better plan is to call a taxi from a tracfone and have them pick you up away from where you live and drop you off a block away from your box. After you retrieve your package, put it in an anti static bag immediately upon leaving the store. The anti static bag acts as a Faraday cage (make sure the entire package is inside), and will prevent a homing signal from revealing your location while the packaging is contained. Backpacks fully lined with tinfoil may work as well. Always test the solution by trying to call a cell phone contained in it.             After the package has been retrieved and measures against homing signals have been taken, walk to a fast food restaurant or some such thing, and take the package into the rest room area. Go through the packaging and check it for bugs as quickly as possible. Online spy shops have cheap bug scanners that can detect cheap bugs that send out homing signals. Destroy the packaging to the best of your ability and dispose of it (perhaps down the toilet). Now call for a second taxi to pick you up and drop you off a distance away from your place of living, and walk back home. It would help to decide the routes you want to take, and the packaging disposal place you want to use, ahead of time.             If a recipient must have a package delivered to a place connected with them, they should ensure said place is clean between shipments. Clean houses of friends can also be used. Upon receiving a package to a place with connections to the recipient, they should not open it but should write return to sender on it. After several days, then the package is safe to be opened. Recipient should never select to have shipping methods which require a package to be signed for.             No matter where you get packages sent, get a feel for the place. Learn to recognize the people that work at your box place. Remember what your mail man looks like. Controlled deliveries are not handled by your traditional mail man, and if a random guy in a mail man uniform asks you to sign something, you should use your head (never sign). Similarly, if a friendly neighbor or dude down the street who you never saw before in your life comes by to give you mail they accidentally had delivered to them, make sure you deny it is yours and ask them to just toss it or something.             Shipping speed is something that needs to be thought about carefully. Sending very fast will rush law enforcements time to obtain a warrant, but will make the package stick out as well. Slow time will make it difficult to determine based on time if a package has been seized or not, but will allow the package to blend in and make it less likely to be seized in the first place. Mail should almost always be sent tracked, and almost never sent with signature. Recipient will be able to check the status of the package online (check tracking fingerprinting 'chapter) if it is tracked, and some times the tracking will signal to you if the package has been seized (which is excellent to know if it was sent to a fake ID po box you can just drop.) but who knows how long it will take before they notice what is being done and stop announcing on tracking that packages have been seized. I suggest you send packages with a middle level of priority, fast enough that a delay could be noticed but slow enough that the package will not stick out.  Items sent with the highest priority shipping speeds tend to be inspected far more than items sent at normal or even mid priority.                   Mail Tracking: (Counter)fingerprinting Arms Race             Recent reports (2010) indicate that mailing agencies have been implementing fingerprinting systems that watch tracking for people connecting from Tor or other open proxies (this is a sort of open source intelligence operation fwiw). It is possible that they are even fingerprinting for people connecting from open WiFi. Such activity could flag a package or address. This is a difficult problem, checking tracking is highly useful but it is not safe to do so with out anonymity. Rooting a local machine and using it as a proxy to check tracking, and only connecting to the local machine via Tor or WiFi, can solve this problem. Of course this requires that you have the ability to take over a local computer.             Using WiFi is probably far less likely to raise suspicion than using Tor or a similar proxy solution. Enough people use random open WiFi (especially WiFi from legitimate locations) that there should be a substantial enough crowd to hide in.                   Interception Detection Technology             By creating RFID devices attached to photovoltaic cells with volatile memory chips, interception can be detected prior to picking up product. The interception detecting devices store a state in memory which can be made to transmit after a period of time. Battery powered RFID tags can transmit a signal over one hundred feet. By configuring the devices to wipe the volatile memory if the photovoltaic cell is triggered, we can detect interceptions. If customs opens the package, the photovoltaic cell triggers a wipe function and clears the key stored in memory. By using a wand to scan for the signal produced by the key, you can thus determine if your package was opened between the vendor sending it and your box (No transmit = opened or RFID tag removed ... Transmit = not opened and RFID tag in place). Customs will not be able to replace the state of the volatile memory after triggering the wipe sequence. More sophisticated devices can also be made in order to trigger upon oxygen and other stimuli. These devices can be created for small sums of money and are quite small. Using this sort of technology could protect substantially from the risk of compromise if the vendor is not themselves malicious.",NA

Helper,45,2013-10-20T01:21:57,Re: The Art of Smuggling (OVDB Production),Bungee54 Member Assembly/OpSec,"GPS Dead Drop Introduction             For localized networks GPS dead drops may be the best way to do product transfer. GPS is a positioning system that allows people with GPS reviver's to determine their coordinates. WAAS GPS is a technology that allows for three meter positioning accuracy.                            Dead drops involve Alice leaving a product at a location, then telling Bob the location so he can make a pick up. Alice can record the GPS coordinates of a position and give the coordinates to Bob. Bob can then use a GPS device to locate the objects coordinates. This is very simple, Bob merely inputs the coordinates into his GPS device and follows an arrow leading him directly to the drop site.                  Alice can perform dead drops in numerous ways. Using dead drop spikes is one option. A dead drop spike is a hollow spike that can be filled with product and easily inserted into the ground. Alice could also place vacuum sealed bags into the back of public toilets. Alice should not reuse drop sites and should avoid cameras at all costs.             Alice needs to keep a few things in mind. First of all, shoe prints are a potential issue with dead drops. Alice may opt to use a special pair of shoes for doing drops and keep these shoes in a hidden location where they will not be found if she is raided. Alice should take measures to avoid leaving recoverable shoe prints in the first place, such as not placing drops in highly muddy areas.             Alice should take all standard precautions; avoid leaving fingerprints on dead drop items, do not carry a cell phone during the drop to avoid cellphone geopositioning intersection attacks, avoid cameras, disguising efforts, etc.                   Interception Technology             There are several technologies used in an attempt to detect packages of illegal substances. Tera hertz scanning is one such example. Tera hertz ray scanning involved illuminating a target envelope with tunable Tera hertz radiation and analyzing the absorption spectra of the resulting image. The results are cross referenced with a database of spectra to check for the chemicals of interest. Currently it takes ten minutes to fully scan and analyze a single letter, although increasing this speed to one minute per letter is in the grasp of current technology. Even with this potential decrease in the amount of time it takes to scan individual letters, this system could not be implemented en masse without slowing the mail system down to a screeching halt. It is much more likely that this technology will be used to scan mail that has already been flagged by customs personnel using other methods.                          Infrared scanners and X-rays work fundamentally in the same way. They are used to detect irregularities in envelopes or packages, which is possible cause for further investigation by other more precise means.                                  Drug dogs are trained to detect even trace amounts of controlled substances and are used by virtually all customs agencies world wide. Despite their excellent ability to detect certain substances, the overwhelming amount of mail in the system means that they will not be able to sniff all mail. In addition to this, drug dogs are not trained to smell the vast majority of existing psychoactive substances, and due to the staggering number of said substances it is virtually impossible that they ever will be. Using vacuum seals can greatly reduce the radius in which a drug dog can hit on a package from, as well as stop agents from smelling products. Avoid using masking scents, they are not useful and can flag a package.                             Counter Tactics: If we get enough people to spray highly concentrated marijuana/alcohol solutions in various mail boxes, we could potentially create a tremendous number of false positives. We need to answer the following research questions: A. Will spraying concentrated marijuana extract into mail boxes rub off onto mail in amounts significant enough to cause a drug dog to alert B. How long after the box is sprayed will mail from it cause a drug dog to alert C. What risks come from spraying such extract into boxes, assuming that nobody notices you while doing it D. Can we cause enough false positives for this to be a worthwhile countermeasure?                  Another method of detection involves drug residue detectors. Traces of controlled substances are collected on a small filter held in the end of a vacuum sweeper hose which has been previously tested to insure no contamination. The instrument uses an analytical technique in which the traces of controlled substances on the filter are heated to vapors and ionized. The time required for the ions to drift through an electric field is measured and the substances are identified by the ""drift"" time through the electric field.                                 Field agents may test a small sample of an intercepted substance to determine if it is likely an illegal drug (or perhaps confirm it is not what it is documented as). They will likely use traditional reagent tests, such as marquis, to accomplish this. A positive result on a reagent test does not absolutely verify what a substance is, but it is likely probable cause for a search warrant, as it will take some time to get a substance GC/MS tested and they are not usually going to want to tip off a suspect with undue delays.                        Absolute identification of a substance will likely be done by GC/MS at a lab. after a package is intercepted GC/MS testing will likely take some time to complete, but is guaranteed to positively identify a substance, provided the lab testing has a reference. Some rare drugs may be difficult for some labs to correctly identify.                        Reactions to Intercepted Mail             There are two potential reactions to an intercepted drug package; a controlled delivery or a love letter. To bust recipients of intercepted drug mail, customs officials will often dress as postmen and make an arrest after the suspect accepts the package. Often times they will allow a few minutes to pass in hopes that the suspect will have opened the package, and then raid the premises. This happens almost always in the case of non-pharmaceutical illegal drug interceptions, and often times with scheduled opiate prescriptions.                            Sometimes if you are getting very small amounts of drugs, especially lowly scheduled drugs and pharmaceuticals, you will only get a letter from customs telling you to knock your shit off. They will almost certainly keep your address in a database, so once you get a love letter make sure never to use that address again.                            You can expect that if you get one package seized, that other incoming packages are likely to be seized as well. So try and only have one incoming pack per box at a time. Also, it is quite likely return address networks can be formed, especially with fast shipping methods. So never ever send mail from a box that has a tie to you unless you get the box JUST for that purpose. Also very frequently change the return address you use to stop network analysis from being done.",NA

We realized this when our router would log the destination IP as 11.1.11.111, which is the same IP that would be returned from searching ""My IP"" in google. To us, this means that a ISP can log both our IP and the VPN IP as well. I know that the VPN provider uses shared IP's. So, in theory we are protected. However, should this be a security concern?

Bungee 54 Forums,otherthanb4,50,2013-10-20T12:42:30,Topic: Traffickers using hackers to import drugs into major Europe ports,Bungee54 Member Assembly/OpSec,"find this very interesting: CLEARWEB --> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/10383504/Traffickers-using-hackers-to-import-drugs-into-major-Europe-ports.html Europol disclose that drug traffickers have recruited hackers to help them smuggle shipments of contraband into major ports including Antwerp   Drug gangs are hacking into computers at European ports to allow them to smuggle in entire container shipments of contraband, Europe's crime fighting agency has disclosed. Officials at Europol have divulged how a group of traffickers suspected of importing tons of cocaine at a time recruited hackers to breach IT systems at one of Belgium's largest ports, Antwerp. It allowed the gang to work out the precise the location and security details of containers of bananas and timber that their accomplices in South America had secretly planted drugs in. Using that information, they then sent in drivers to steal the cargo before the containers' legitimate owners arrived to pick them up. ""We have effectively a service-orientated industry where organised crime groups are paying for specialist hacking skills that they can acquire online,"" one Europol official told the BBC. The scam has echoes of a plot in the hit US crime thriller, The Wire, in which a drug smuggling gang at a port in the city of Baltimore hire corrupt dockworkers to alter the computer records of containers with drugs planted in them.Related Articles The Antwerp plot came to light after police were called in to investigate complaints by shipping companies that containers were going missing at the port. When the scam was initially uncovered and extra computer security installed, the gang sneaked hackers into the docks' offices and fitted special key-logging devices onto computer terminals. These allowed them to remotely monitor everything that was typed on the computer's key boards, and also give them access to passwords and screengrabs. Subsequent police raids on more than 20 homes and businesses uncovered more than a ton of cocaine, valued at ?130 million, along with caches of guns, body armour and ?1m in cash. ""These criminal organisations always look for a new way to get drugs out of the harbour,"" says Danny Decraene, head of the Antwerp organised crime unit of the Belgian Federal Police. ""In this case they hired hackers who were very high level, intelligent guys, doing a lot of software work."" Fifteen people are now awaiting trial in both Belgium and the Netherlands in connection with the raids. In January, a lorry driver unconnected to the plot was shot at by men with assault rifles after unwitting taking one of the gang's containers from the port at Antwerp. They had apparently suspected he was from a rival smuggling outfit. Rob Wainwright, Europol's British director, said the case showed the need for police to become ""more tech savvy"".",NA
Bungee 54 Forums,stanizta,50,2013-10-20T16:00:59,Re: Traffickers using hackers to import drugs into major Europe ports,Bungee54 Member Assembly/OpSec,"Read this quite a while back, just shows how technology helps move huge consignment of illicit material across. And to my surprise a few days later I came across another article, in which the perpetrators used a more sophisticated technique. As it says almost out of a Bond Movie.. Chk it out CLEARWEB -->http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/10021140/Narco-torpedoes-and-frogmen-drug-smuggling-ring-busted-in-Rotterdam.html French and Dutch police have smashed a smuggling ring that sent cocaine-filled ""narco-torpedoes"" bolted to cargo ships from South America to Europe's largest port, where criminal frogmen recovered them.  Three French divers were arrested earlier this month as they prepared to dive under a cargo boat in Rotterdam which had 101kg of pure cocaine stuffed into a missile-shaped container attached to its hull.  The chief of Nice?s judicial police who led the sting operation described the ingenious technique - never seen before in Europe - as ?worthy of James Bond? and warned that it could been in use in British ports.  Narcotics agents first got wind of the scheme last June when bemused port police fished four divers ? complete with underwater propulsion vehicle - out of inky-black waters near Fos-sur-Mer, a major oil port on France?s Mediterranean coast, in the middle of the night.  ?Our initial reaction was: are they shooting a scene from an action movie?,? said Philippe Frizon, head of Nice judicial police.  The divers were released, but police soon realised these were no ordinary frogmen. Two of them were linked to Marco Armando, 56, considered one of the masterminds of a 1992 heist in which 146 million francs (?14.6 million) were stolen from a branch of the Bank of France. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1996 but let out in 2005.  Another was Jean-Michel Dominici, brother of Corsican gangster Ange-Philippe Dominici, convicted to 14 years in 2010 for his part in the theft of 3,000 gold ingots from Swiss precious metals firm Metalor in 2004. The bullion has never been recovered.  Police watched with growing incredulity as more underwater reconnaissance missions were conducted.  ?When we saw these people training with autonomous diving gear, submersibles and inflatable parachutes to refloat heavy objects from the depths, we wondered what the hell are they up to?,? Mr Frizon told the Daily Telegraph.  ?Given some of these people?s past form in Europe?s criminal underworld and their sudden taste for tourism in South America, we decided to take a much closer look.?  Police tracked Mr Armando for a year, finally trailing him and two associates as they drove from southern France to Rotterdam via Paris and Antwerp on April 16 in rented cars loaded with heavy diving equipment.  The men never reached open water.  Tipped off by their French colleagues, Dutch police arrested the suspects and seized their gear, including two propulsion vehicles and inflatable parachutes.  In a metal cradle attached to the hull of the Delta Laguna, a Dutch cargo ship that departed from Venezuela with a stop in Curacao in the Dutch Caribbean, police found a rusting torpedo-shaped metal tube over 8 feet long, stuffed with cocaine worth up to 7 million euros on the street.  Nine other suspects were arrested in France - two in Corsica, five in Nice, one in Marseille and one in Toulouse. They found weapons and a cocaine workshop. In all five were placed under formal investigation on drug trafficking charges.  Mr Frizon said anti-narcotic police in Colombia and Peru had first alerted him to the torpedo technique around three years ago.  ?We knew drug cartels were looking for safer ways of transporting their wares. Air travel is problematic when it passes via Africa while cargo ships are at the mercy of customs checks on the surface,? he said.  ?Another ploy was to attach drug-filled mini-submarines to the back of cargo vessels via a metal cable, but these were easily spotted. So they developed this new method.?  He said the cocaine came from Peru and Colombia and was likely destined for sale in Paris and southern France.  Police believe Mr Armando to have masterminded the ""narco-torpedo"" operation.  The three divers are due to be transferred back to France in the coming weeks. Five of those questioned have been placed under formal investigation on suspicion of belonging to the ring. The inquiry is ongoing.  Police said the scheme had likely been ongoing for years with a transatlantic trip every six months, and that he could not rule out the possibility that the team his men were tracking managed to smuggle in cocaine even under surveillance.  ?We are the first to have caught a team in the act but it?s almost certain others are or have been doing the same thing,? said Bernard Mascarelli of Nice judicial police.  When asked whether such a technique might be in use in British ports, he said: ?Absolutely?.",NA
Bungee 54 Forums,otherthanb4,60,2013-10-24T17:49:53,Topic: Increase Tor client security by network isolation,Bungee54 Member Assembly/SigSec,"hey guys. as you might know when freedom hosting got seized an exploit was used to send requests to an FBI server letting them collect real ip addresses of users and leaking there identity... with minor effort you can implement network setup where you can be sure that no unwanted connections are made to the normal internet from tor.  this is done by separating tor client and gateway. having a packet filter in between you can control exactly which connections are allowed and which to drop. i think the same concept is how whonix does it. however whonix relies on virtual machines which might be exploitet as well. by using physical hardware you can achieve the same without virtual machines. all you need is: * PC running tails* PC running tor gateway (providing SOCKS port)* packet filter in between only allowing one TCP port (SOCKS) between the two, DROPPING everything else ideally your tor gateway is using an VPN to build TOR connection and so even hiding TOR from your ISP.. let me know what you think about this and if you want a more detailed explanation about how to achieve this.",NA

EDIT: an even easier approach would be to just block internet access for TOR client at router1. however the upstream router is more sphisticated ;-),NA

Bungee 54 Forums,TocToc,276,2014-04-28T08:41:38,Topic: French TrueCrypt Tutorial,Bungee54 Member Assembly/Security,"Tutoriel Truecrypt pour dÃ©butant Qu'est ce que TrueCryptTrueCrypt est un logiciel pour la crÃ©ation et l'utilisation Ã  la volÃ©e de volumes cryptÃ©s.  Que veut dire ""Ã  la volÃ©e"" ? Et bien tout simplement que la gestion du cryptage/dÃ©cryptage est faite en temps rÃ©el par le logiciel et de ce fait les donnÃ©es sont automatiquement cryptÃ©es juste avant leur enregistrement et dÃ©cryptÃ©es juste aprÃ¨s leur chargement, sans aucune intervention de l'utilisateur. Ce tutoriel contient Ã©tape par Ã©tape les instructions sur la faÃ§on de crÃ©er, monter et utiliser un volume TrueCrypt. Pour ce tutoriel nous partirons du principe que vous voulez crypter un volume sur une clÃ© usb (de 8Go pour l'exemple et qui portera la lettre G:) afin d'y stocker vos fichiers/logiciels liÃ©s Ã  votre utilisation du Darknet (TorBrowser, Gpg4Usb, etc). Si vous ne l'avez pas encore fait, tÃ©lÃ©chargez TrueCrypt Ã  cette adresse : http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads Ensuite lancez l'installateur, sÃ©lectionnez ""extract"" comme option dâinstallation puis sÃ©lectionnez votre clÃ© usb comme cible (par ex G:\TrueCrypt\). Une fois l'installation terminÃ©e, lancez TrueCrypt en double-cliquant sur le fichier TrueCrypt.exe (ou autre en fonction de votre OS). La fenÃªtre principale de TrueCrypt devrait apparaitre.   Comment crÃ©er un conteneur TrueCryptCliquez sur ""CrÃ©er un volume"". La fenÃªtre de l'assistant de crÃ©ation de volume devrait apparaitre.  Un volume TrueCrypt peut rÃ©sider dans un fichier, qui est aussi appelÃ© conteneur, dans une partition de disque dur ou un support externe. Dans ce tutoriel, nous allons choisir la premiÃ¨re option et crÃ©er un volume TrueCrypt dans un fichier qui sera stockÃ© sur notre clÃ© usb. Comme l'option est, normalement, sÃ©lectionnÃ©e par dÃ©faut, il vous suffit de cliquer sur Suivant.  Vous devez ensuite choisir si vous souhaitez crÃ©er un volume TrueCrypt standard ou cachÃ©. Dans ce tutoriel, nous allons choisir la premiÃ¨re option et crÃ©er un volume TrueCrypt standard. Comme l'option est, normalement, sÃ©lectionnÃ©e par dÃ©faut, il vous suffit une nouvelle fois de cliquer sur Suivant.  Vous devez maintenant spÃ©cifier oÃ¹ vous souhaitez que le conteneur soit crÃ©Ã© ainsi que son nom. Cliquez sur ""Fichiers..."", dans la fenÃªtre de sÃ©lection sÃ©lectionnez votre clÃ© usb (G:) et entrez le nom que le fichier portera dans la partie ""Nom du fichier"", par ex ""Home.ext"". L'extension importe peu cela peut Ãªtre .ext, .txt, .mp3 ou autre, vous pouvez Ã©galement crÃ©er un fichier sans extension.  Notez qu'un conteneur TrueCrypt est comme n'importe quel fichier normal. Il peut Ãªtre, par exemple, dÃ©placÃ© ou supprimÃ©. IMPORTANT: TrueCrypt ne va pas crypter les fichiers existants. Si vous sÃ©lectionnez un fichier existant dans cette Ã©tape, il sera Ã©crasÃ© et remplacÃ© par le volume nouvellement crÃ©Ã© et le fichier Ã©crasÃ© sera perdu. Vous serez en mesure de chiffrer les fichiers existants plus tard en les dÃ©plaÃ§ant vers le volume TrueCrypt que nous crÃ©ons maintenant. Cliquez sur ""Enregistrer"" puis sur ""Suivant"". Vous pouvez ensuite choisir un algorithme de chiffrement et un algorithme de hachage pour le volume. Si vous n'Ãªtes pas sÃ»r de ce que vous sÃ©lectionnez ici, vous pouvez utiliser les paramÃ¨tres par dÃ©faut et cliquer sur Suivant. Pour plus d'informations, consultez (en Anglais) :    - Algorithmes de chiffrement : http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/encryption-algorithms   - Algorithmes de hachage : http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/hash-algorithms Nous arrivons donc sur la partie oÃ¹ nous prÃ©cisons la taille de notre conteneur. Le minimum est de 1 mÃ©gaoctet dans notre exemple nous allons spÃ©cifier 7Go, ce qui laissera un peu moins d'un Go au cas oÃ¹ nous voulons momentanÃ©ment stocker quelque chose de non cryptÃ© sur la clÃ©. Vous pouvez, bien sÃ»r, spÃ©cifier une taille diffÃ©rente. AprÃ¨s avoir tapÃ© la taille souhaitÃ©e dans le champ de saisie, cliquez sur Suivant. C'est maintenant l'une des Ã©tapes les plus importantes. Ici, vous devez choisir un bon mot de passe pour le volume. Si vous avez un doute lisez attentivement les informations affichÃ©es dans la fenÃªtre de l'assistant pour savoir ce qui est considÃ©rÃ© comme un bon mot de passe. AprÃ¨s avoir choisi un mot de passe, tapez-le dans le premier champ de saisie, puis ressaisissez le dans le champ de saisie en dessous. Remarque: Le bouton Suivant sera dÃ©sactivÃ© jusqu'Ã  ce que les mots de passe dans les deux champs de saisie soient les mÃªmes. Cliquez sur Suivant et tenez vous prÃªt. Maintenant vous allez devoir dÃ©placer votre souris au hasard dans la fenÃªtre de l'assistant de crÃ©ation de volume, faites le au moins 30 secondes. Plus longtemps vous dÃ©placez la souris, meilleur sera la force cryptographique des clÃ©s de chiffrement qui seront crÃ©es ce qui augmente la sÃ©curitÃ© de votre volume.  Une fois que vous avez suffisamment dÃ©placÃ© votre souris cliquez sur Formater. La crÃ©ation du volume devrait dÃ©marrer, TrueCrypt crÃ©era, selon notre exemple, un fichier nommÃ© ""Home.ext"" sur la clÃ© usb ""G:"". En fonction de la taille du volume, la crÃ©ation du fichier peut prendre beaucoup de temps. AprÃ¨s avoir terminÃ©, la boite de dialogue vous confirmant la fin de l'opÃ©ration de crÃ©ation apparait, cliquez sur OK pour fermer la boite de dialogue. Nous venons de crÃ©er avec succÃ¨s un volume TrueCrypt. Dans la fenÃªtre de l'assistant de crÃ©ation de volume cliquez sur Quitter. La fenÃªtre de l'assistant devrait disparaitre laissant place Ã  la fenÃªtre principale de TrueCrypt. Comment monter un conteneur TrueCryptNous allons maintenant monter le volume que nous venons de crÃ©er pour pouvoir l'utiliser. Dans la fenÃªtre principale sÃ©lectionnez une lettre de lecteur dans la liste en haut (pour notre exemple ce sera Z:). Ce sera la lettre du lecteur sur lequel le conteneur TrueCrypt sera montÃ©. Cliquez sur ""Fichier..."", la fenÃªtre de sÃ©lection de fichier standard devrait apparaitre. Recherchez le fichier conteneur que nous avons crÃ©Ã© et sÃ©lectionnez-le puis cliquez sur ""Ouvrir"". Nous revenons maintenant sur la fenÃªtre principale de TrueCrypt. Cliquez sur ""Monter"". Une boite de dialogue devrait apparaitre vous demandant votre mot de passe. Tapez le mot de passe dans le champ de saisie puis cliquez sur Ok. TrueCrypt va maintenant tenter de monter le volume. Si le mot de passe est incorrect, le logiciel vous avertira et vous devrez rÃ©pÃ©ter l'Ã©tape prÃ©cÃ©dente (tapez Ã  nouveau le mot de passe et cliquez sur OK). Si le mot de passe est correct, le volume sera montÃ©. Comment utiliser un conteneur TrueCryptNous avons donc montÃ©s avec succÃ¨s notre conteneur comme un disque virtuel portant la lettre ""Z:"". Le disque virtuel est entiÃ¨rement cryptÃ© (y compris les noms de fichiers, les tables d'allocation, l'espace libre, etc) et se comporte comme un disque rÃ©el. Vous pouvez enregistrer (ou copier, dÃ©placer, etc) des fichiers sur ce disque virtuel et ils seront cryptÃ©es Ã  la volÃ©e et inversement si vous ouvrez un fichier stockÃ© sur le volume le fichier sera automatiquement dÃ©cryptÃ© Ã  la volÃ©e. Important: Notez que lorsque vous ouvrez un fichier stockÃ© sur un volume TrueCrypt (ou lorsque vous Ã©crivez / copier un fichier vers / depuis le volume TrueCrypt) vous ne serez pas invitÃ© Ã  entrer de nouveau le mot de passe. Vous devez entrer le mot de passe correct que lors du montage du volume. Vous pouvez ouvrir et parcourir le volume montÃ© comme si vous naviguiez normalement sur un disque dur ou une clÃ© usb. Notez que TrueCrypt n'enregistre jamais toutes les donnÃ©es dÃ©cryptÃ©es d'un disque, il les stocke temporairement dans la RAM (mÃ©moire). MÃªme lorsque le volume est montÃ©, les donnÃ©es stockÃ©es dans le volume sont encore et restent cryptÃ©es. Lorsque le volume est dÃ©montÃ© ou que vous Ã©teignez votre ordinateur, tous les fichiers stockÃ©s sont inaccessible et chiffrÃ©es.  Vous pouvez Ã©galement y stocker et lancer des applications portable tel que le TorBrowser ou Gpg4Usb leurs fichiers Ã©tant automatiquement dÃ©cryptÃ©s au moment de leur chargement. Comment dÃ©monter un conteneur TrueCryptFermez tous les fichiers et applications stockÃ©s sur le volume Ã  dÃ©monter. Dans la fenÃªtre principale de TrueCrypt sÃ©lectionnez le lecteur dans la liste (en lâoccurrence le lecteur Z:), puis cliquez sur DÃ©monter. Voila c'est fait pour rendre de nouveau les fichiers accessible, vous devrez une nouvelle fois monter le volume.",NA

In theory, if you check verify the install and all of the boxes are check you should be okay. Also, you are using the beta version. This may just be a bug because it is a development release.",NA

That'll be the way to search when you already know the products and vendors on the road.   FAVORITE VENDORS You'll also be able to have a  QUICK access to your Favorite vendors on the left panel above the BTC Exchange Rates. (I'll explain that later on how it's done from the Vendors Profile page)    THE MAIN LISTINGS FRAME  Now lets get to what is in front of you now on the  home page. You should be  seeing listings of various products which are  randomly selected and shown. Not the best way for you to find what you need.  Now  lets sort this out a little bit.  Your  filter is shown in the  PRODUCTS bar:   Choose how you want your search results to be arranged:  Random is default but in the scroll bar you can choose to have it sorted by:  NEW/OLD,  PRICE (Highest or Lowest First),  SIZE (Big or Small first),  BEST SELLERS, BEST RATINGS, MOST VIEWS, NAME  The tick box for  SHIPS TO MY REGION is most useful, as it will remove all listings that you couldn't order anyways,  leaving what you CAN buy visible. This setting will know what is YOUR REGION as the country you entered in Your Profile (Explained in the Setting Up an Account Tutorial).  Tick the  SHIPS FROM MY REGION also to only have domestic sellers listings show up. (If from a small country chances are that there are no domestic sellers so you'll get 0 results, just untick it.  Also some vendors set the shipping country to Undisclosed so they would get knocked out from your search despite being domestic)  Then  Hit The UPDATE bar. You've set the basic filters that way, it can be modified any time druring your session. It is reseted to random everytime you log in.   Now to the  MAIN PRODUCT SEARCH    PRODUCT CATEGORIES.  It's quite clear what they mean... Cannabis is weed, etc... Each  CATEGORY allows access to  SUB-CATEGORIES when hitting the + plus button next to the category. (some categories don't really have subcatgories it'll just take you to ALL)  For example: CANNABIS gives you access to these categories: INDICA, HYBRID, and SATIVA.  Just  click on the Category or Sub Category you're interested in and  search resuslts will appear sorted according to your filters you've just set up previously.  Most often there are  more than 1 search result pages. You'll find access to the other pages at the bottom below the listings with a ""Previous 1 2 ...15 Next""    bar to navigate through the pages.  Now you've hit the search and have found results,   You can see on the search page Pictures and Listing Descriptions.     The SEARCH PAGE LISTING DESCRIPTION:  *The  PICTURE *The  LISTING Description * VENDOR INFORMATION with the vendors Name, his  Feedback average out of 5 (5 being best) and  the number of sales he's done on the market. *The  PRICE in Your CURRENCY (the one set in Your Profile - see the Tutorial for setting up the account for help) converted from the price in BiTCoins below. * WEIGHT of the item. (often also stated in the listing Descrition)   Clicking on the PHOTO or the DESCRIPTION will take you to the  FULL LISTING description.  Clicking on the VENDOR NAME will take you to the  VENDORS PROFILE page with loads of Important Information (will be explained below in the tutorial).     The FULL LISTING PAGE:  * You'll find a  Large Photo of the item here withe the  Listing Description and the Price for the amount lsted.  * The  Shipment Policy of the Seller:  Where he Ships From and Where He Ships To.  * The different  Shipping Options in the scroll box. BE CAREFUL WHEN SELECTING that you chose the right shipping option for you and your country. Some sellers also offer Tracked services, so make sure you're clicking on what you really want and most importantly FOR YOUR COUNTRY.  * The  ESCROW Type: Traditionnal Escrow (based on the C Road site) Or Multi-Signature Escrow (not always offered).  I'll explain traditionnal escrow and how the payment is done in another tutorial. There is also a tutorial for multi-sig escrow which is quite a bit more complicated and not necessarely a newbie firendly method to start off buying. So chose Traditionnal Escrow for the time.  *  Quantity: Type in the amount of the item you want (Note that sellers often sell diferrent quantities at cheaper prices the bigger, you can see those in that Vendors other listings)  *The  ADD TO CART Button will do exactly that when clicked. Your will then  be taken to your Shopping Cart Ready for Checkout if you're done shopping.   * SELLER: Name You can click on the sellers name to access the Vendors Profile from here also.  * Below is the  FULL PRODUCT DESCRIPTION  You usually find  information on the product, the vendors stealth, shipment delays, etc...   Other Very useful information is found on the Vendors Profile page (Remember you can click on the vendors profile by clicking on his name below the ADD TO CART Button.   YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO CONSULT THE VENDORS PROFILE ALSO before buying. (See the use of using multiple tabs here    * Below that is the  RECENT FEEDBACK received by the VENDOR  ON THIS SPECIFIC LISTING Feedback from sales of his other listings can be found on the Vendors Profile).  That Sums up the Listings Page  Since we need to check to Vendors Profile anyways for several things lets do that now.     VENDORS PROFILE So either click: *  From the Listing Page on the vendors name below the ADD to CART button.  OR *  From the Search Result Page on the vendors name above the feedback star. or *  From the Top Search Bar by typing the Vendors username and selecting Vendor from the scrollbox. You'll have to click on the user name again on the result page. (Least practical way)   text here   PROTECTING YOURSELF AND CHOOSING A VENDOR   YOU ALL NEED TO READ THE FIRST POST OF THIS TOPIC ABOUT AVOIDING SCAMMING VENDORS WHEN YOU CHOSE A VENDOR It has Great Guidelines to follow  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=243.0   THE CHOICE OF A VENDOR IS IMPORTANT. Read the  feedbacks on the Vendors Profile to see all his activity profile, check the  feedback on the listing page to see feedback for that item.   READ THE FORUM. Check the  OFFICIAL VENDOR REVIEW THREAD for information on vendors. Protect yourself!!! And help protect others by posting on the forums.   ",

Cannabis Road 2,PyroWolf,528,2014-08-02T05:44:00,Iran Blacklists TOR Network,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"Iran, one of the worlds biggest Internet censors, has begun blocking the Tor network. In the last week, the state-owned Telecommunications Company of Iran has effectively knocked off 75 percent of all Tor traffic in the country.  Tor, an anonymity tool used by millions of people around the world for a wide variety of purposes, is a powerful and popular tool used in Iran used by political activists and citizens looking to get around the countrys strict speech and press laws.  Normally, as many as 40,000 Iranians are using Tor at any given moment. Today, that number has dropped to 10,000 and falling.  Tor, which until recently worked easily with a simple download in Iran, has a long history of battling for anonymity inside of Persia. The software was used effectively and widely during protests in 2009. The government began rolling out a new state-of-the-art Internet censorship system in 2011 in an attempt to build a Halal Internet. Since then, the government has gone after Tors promise of anonymity and, consequently, freedom from Irans rules in a variety of ways. Combined, Irans censorship tools have been labelled the Great Persian Firewall, a nod to Chinas similar system of online suppression.  In 2011, Tor and Iran engaged in an arms race, as the government would find a new methods of blocking and Tors developers would build new circumvention toolssometimes even releasing them on the same day the governments censors built their blocks.  That arms race with Iran, and other censorship regimes around the globe, continues to this day.  Irans latest move attempts to block all of the Tor network relays publicly listed by the Tor Project, is not absolute. It takes several more steps to to circumvent Irans action. But it is possible.  Iranians can attempt to access Bridgessecret and unlisted Tor relays designed to circumvent censorship that are much more difficult to blockas a hidden path onto the Tor network. Another option for bridges is to email  bridges@torproject.org from either Riseup.net, Gmail or Yahoo, a rule set in place to avoid fake emails being sent.  Users outside of Iran can run a Tor bridge to help circumvent the censorship. We outlined how to run a Tor bridge several months ago when it was the Turkish government trying and failing to block Tor.   Clearnet Source  ",

Always use a new CR wallet address for every deposit.  Never use them twice.  That's why it tells you how much BTC it has recieved per wallet. Don't delete them though until transactions are fully processed.  Also when you transfer BTC from your legit coinbase to your blockchain account always use a new blockchain account on TOR.  Process:  1.  Buy BTC on coinbase on legit ISP connection as yourself, don't use VPN, TOR, etc. 2.  Log on to VPN+TOR and create a blockchain account anonymously.  Don't even tell it an email address. 3.  Transfer BTC from coinbase to anonymously tor created blockchain account. 4.  Then transfer from anonymously created tor blockchain account to bitcoin fog or just shared send it to your CR wallet.  I think as long as you transferred from coinbase to anonymously created TOR blockchain address and then shared send it over to CR you are probably covered well enough.  If you were a seller I'd say take more precautions.  Oh and use Tails.  Keep it up to date. Have 2 USB keys.  Make a backup file using USB key backup utility and restore it to the 2nd key every time you make persistent changes.  Keep the two keys in seperate physical locations so you cannot lose both at once.     I personally use VPN service on top of windows running tails in a VM.  My ISP cannot see that I am using TOR/Tails then and I am anonymous on TOR.",

Cannabis Road 2,kwikeemart,166,2014-06-29T17:56:10,Vendor Communications,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,Ya all incoming messages are not hard to decrypt. Though not all outgoing messages need to be encrypted. A lot of the time we are not sending out any incriminating information and adding 5 keys to our key chain a day is pointless. But even if a vendor asks you to utilize plain text just use PGP. If they do not have enough time in the day to decrypt your personal sensitive information they probably do not have enough time to package your product properly either.  If they have a million customers and deem it to be to time consuming they should increase the cost of the product they offer turn up the profit per sale and decrease the amount of sales that flow through them. There fore keeping the same profit but doing less work for it. Just my 2 cents stay safe and realize many people were busted from SR1 because they did not use PGP.,
Cannabis Road 2,ModernLove,166,2014-06-03T00:12:49,Vendor Communications,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"I can't imagine ever discouraging someone from using encryption, though in fairness it should be admitted that we probably receive no more than ten messages a day across all markets. If we received a couple hundred every day, maybe I'd feel differently. But I don't think so. It seems a lot like wearing a seatbelt. It only takes a second, but it can literally save your life.  On a side note, I think some vendors could avoid a lot of messages from prospective buyers if they outlined basic info about shipping, refunds, products, etc. in their vendor profiles or listing descriptions.",
Cannabis Road 2,Crypto,166,2014-05-15T20:36:54,Vendor Communications,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"You are 100% correct. This particular vendor is not too tech savvy unfortunately, and I really hate to see a message like this in their profile.   But each to their own, and everyone is responsible for their own security. We definitely have other vendors you can order from instead who prefer everything to be encrypted.",

Cannabis Road 2,chocolatelove,166,2014-05-16T13:37:51,Vendor Communications,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,Thanks for the reply. I'm glad I wasn't being overly paranoid (or maybe we both are!)...,
Cannabis Road 2,chocolatelove,166,2014-05-15T14:04:05,Vendor Communications,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"Hey all, I've been looking at various vendor profiles and I came across a vendor who preferred most communicaitons be in plain text, stating it was too time comsuming to decrypt various messages. This rubbed me the wrong way, and I'd like to first explain why, and then ask your opinion on the matter. I say that ALL communication with a vendor should be encrypted. Messages that aren't encrypted could be eavesdropped on or surveilled. The more communications that are collected and gathered about you could eventually remove your anonymity. Spelling mistakes, speech patterns, and more can be used to pick you out of a crowd. Why take the chance?  Also, if we are switching back and forth between encrypted and non-encrypted communications, we are leaving another opening for human error to creep in. Imagine accidentally sending your address unencrypted. No, it is better to get in the habit of ALWAYS using encryption. My freedom is worth more than the extra minute or so it takes to view my encrypted message. If you are a vendor who wants all communications plain text (other than addresses), I'm sorry, but I can't do business with you. I respect your privacy and OpSec, please respect mine.  What are your thoughts? Am I wrong in taking this stand? Thanks for reading",

Cannabis Road 2,PyroWolf,527,2014-08-02T05:38:41,"WTF?! US GOV""T Increases Funding for TOR + $1.8 Million!",Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"Tor, the internet anonymiser, received more than $1.8m in funding from the US government in 2013, even while the NSA was reportedly trying to destroy the network.  According to the Tor Projects latest annual financial statements, the organisation received $1,822,907 from the US government in 2013. The bulk of that came in the form of pass-through grants, money which ultimately comes from the US government distributed through some independent third-party.  Formerly known as the onion router, Tor is software which allows its users to browse the internet anonymously. It works by bouncing connections through encrypted relays, preventing any eavesdropper from determining what sites a particular user is visiting, or from determining who the users of a particular site actually are. That makes it popular amongst organisations trying to promote freedom of speech in nations like China and Syria  but also popular amongst users trying to evade surveillance in the West.  The two largest single grantors of federal money were SRI international, a non-profit research and development centre that aims to bridge the gap between abstract research and industry, and Internews Network, an international non-profit that funds programmes supporting democracy and human rights. The latter gave $555,413 in funding originally from the US Department of State, while the former gave $830,269 in funding ultimately stemming from the US Department of Defense.  The Tor Project also received direct funding from the National Science Foundation and the US Department of State, totalling $100,325 and $256,900 respectively.  The continued funding of Tor by the American government, including (indirectly) the Department of Defense, stands in stark contrast to the Guardians revelation in October 2013 that the National Security Agency and GCHQ were attempting to destroy the network. Documents obtained by the Guardian detailed proof-of-concept attacks designed to either bring down the Tor network entirely, or to de-anomymise users.  Despite the NSAs attacks on the service, federal funding of Tor has actually increased year-on-year. In 2012, the organisation only received $1.2m in funding from the US government, none of which was direct.  Clearnet Source",

I've been doing a ton of reading this is what I did. First, I got tor and you did too or you wouldn't be here! Next, do this with your Tor browser  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=3.0. Now after you do this with your browser, you will not be able to access some sites which is a huge pain but better safe than sorry. Even after you do that with your browser, it's not enough. Get a VPN service that you have to pay for. Security aint free my friend. Now buy some bitcoin. I used lupojacks advice and got Coinbase. Get those coins in your real name from your real bank account.  it takes forever to get your coin unless you have a visa. Next, blend your coins.  http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/?p=index Try here, you can get a free account. Now you will need a wallet (bitcoinwallet.com) you can get in a fake name with a fake email. I use hidemyass for email and VPN. Put your blended coins in your secret wallet then tranfer to your CR wallets. Not sure after that...have not placed order yet. I have read all kinds of stuff on PGP keys and found the easiest was using Igolder.com stupid ass easy and nothing to DL. Sent my first vendor message today so hopefully that went well. Just make sure you copy and paste your public PGP key in your account. From what I've read, never do business with vendors who use FE as the this site was designed to keep people honest but the digression will go to you after you get to know your vendor.   Now on your end, which is no problem for me, buy from Ebay. NOT amazon or anyone who will have designated boxes. Ebay or Etsy. I do this on a constant basis plus I had a business so I get shit constantly. Makes for better stealth with your post office IMO. I hope Ive covered most of it for you. As you do these things, it will become easier and clearer on how things work. Good luck Idontcare!",

Cannabis Road 2,AngelEyes,325,2014-07-05T01:33:19,Can someone help me get started?,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"Great advice here.  Read everything you can get your hands on.  There are tons of tutorials from all sorts of helpful folks here and on many of the other forums like The Hub.  I'd recommend using a non-windows operating system for your darknet activities.  I say this because windows is the least secure OS by far.  If you don't want to go the tails route, which is the safest (and probably easiest as well), you can get free desktop virtualization software from Oracle called VirtualBox.  You can set up a linux virtual system that runs through VirtualBox, download the linux version of Tor and you're good to go.  Also, it really pays to learn PGP.  It may take a little while to get the concepts and functionality down but there are a million tutorials on the darknet forums to help, and you can always ask specific questions as well.  Finally, before ordering from any vendors make sure to not just read their profile and feedback, but read through their forum review thread.  Its vital to do this last because feedback can be spoofed and unless you can hear directly from customers of the vendor you just don't know if they're a scammer or not.  As for FE, I wouldn't do it unless your vendor is trusted.  Even then there have been quite a few trusted vendors that stopped dealing from their vendor accounts and stole tons of coins on their way out the door.  That won't work on you if you don't FE.  Good luck and feel free to ask any questions you might have.",
Cannabis Road 2,copycat,325,2014-06-30T14:46:04,Can someone help me get started?,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security," I'd be careful using any web based (which means server based) encryption apps.  It may make it easy but there is much speculation on privacy policies and if these sites keep the data, cooperate with authorities, keep keys, etc.  This means that you may be jeopardizing your privacy and safety.    What OS are you using when on the markets?  Maybe some of us can make some recommendations.  As Lupojak posted before, I think reddit.com/r/darkmarketnoobs is a good resource to use.  There are FAQs and guides on how to do pretty much everything.  And, in my opinion, it may be overkill to use both a vpn and tor.  tor in itself is anonymous (of course, with possible holes as with everything else).  Your ISP knows you're using tor, but cannot see what you are doing.  Now, if you aren't using the best security practices for yourself (using tails, not saving anything locally, using server based encryption), then VPN is ok to add.  All I want to say is ""READ READ READ.  Understand before doing.  Ask questions if you need to - or read more""   With all that scary stuff being said, for smaller personal amounts it is unlikely they are going to go after you unless you live in an area where they want to make an example out of you.  Just try to keep a cool head about your dealings and be aware of what risks are where.   ","Hi Idontcare, PGP keys and found the easiest was using Igolder.com stupid ass easy and nothing to DL.

All users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes numerous security issues.  Changes  Notable user-visible changes include:      Security fixes         Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox         24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).     Major new features         Spoof the network interfaces' MAC address         by default. It can be disabled in Tails Greeter.         Rework the way to         configure how Tor connects to the network         by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. This option         can be set from Tails Greeter, and replaces the old         experimental ""bridge mode"" feature.     Bugfixes         Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.         Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.         Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.         Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver. We don't need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.         Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available in Windows Camouflage mode.         Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin.     Minor improvements         Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.         Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.         Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.         Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.         Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).         Disable the autologin text consoles. This was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.         Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.         Make it possible to manually start IBus.         Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving full control over Tor to the desktop user.         Incremental upgrades improvements:             Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion.             Lock down sudo credentials a bit.             Hide debugging information.             Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports. This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.             Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.             Various user interface and phrasing improvements.         Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension.         Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange.         Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently, too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.         Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig.         Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by Debian back.         Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.         Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.         Persistent Volume Assistant:             Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.             Optimize window height.             Display device paths in a more user-friendly way.  See the online Changelog for technical details.  Known issues      Longstanding known issues.  I want to try it or to upgrade!  Go to the download page.  As no software is ever perfect, we maintain a list of problems that affects the last release of Tails.  What's coming up?  The next Tails release is scheduled for April 29.  Have a look to our roadmap to see where we are heading to.  Would you want to help? There are many ways you can contribute to Tails. If you want to help, come talk to us!

Here is what I have done so far with setting up and using pgp -  1. Downloaded gpg4usb programme and created my key pair, Backed up copy of my private key.   2. Copied the sellers public key into notepad and saved it then imported it to gpg4usb and it now appears on the right hand side on the screen below my key.   3. I put my public key on my profile.   4. I type my message in the clipboard thing on left hand side of the programme then I click on the sellers key and hit encypt. I copy this into CR message to seller.   5. Seller replies to me and I copy and paste it into gpg4usb programmes clipboard. Hit decrypt and I am asked for my password. Enter password and bingo I can read sellers reply.   So my question is what I am doing wrong that the seller cannot contact me via his. Would it be he does not have my correct public key?  I must mention that I originally created a key pair with another pgpg programme GPG4win but I read gpg4usb easier to use so created new key pair with it. Seller had my original public key but I sent him new one and made sure correct one is on my profile.   Sorry for being a complete noob but want to make sure I get this important step right for all concerned. I've read a few noob guides and watched few video guides but my tired stressed brain is melted!   Thanks in advance to any kind souls     Respect and peace.   Gak",

Cannabis Road 2,PyroWolf,609,2014-08-15T13:27:08,BTC 'Conspiracy Theory' - Virtual Currency is NSA or CIA Project,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"From International Business Times, UK edition - *CN>  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-suspected-be-nsa-cia-project-1460439   Bitcoin 'Conspiracy Theory' Alleges Virtual Currency is NSA or CIA Project  Digital currency bitcoin, which has experienced sudden growth in terms of usage and value, has been criticised by many and some have labelled it as a ponzi scheme. Given its alleged use in drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing and other anti-social activities, a number of states across the globe have warned consumers about the risks involved in relying on and using the decentralised money.  Now, a group that claims to track the activities of government organisations around the globe alleges that the popular cryptocurrency is a project run by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose reputation has been hit by the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden.  The group, named CIA Project, claims that bitcoin is made by the NSA or the CIA. However, the 'evidences' the group presents lack depth, potentially making it a conspiracy theory. CIA Project's main proof revolves around the name of bitcoin's alleged creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The group says a white paper on bitcoin was released in 2008, and it was reportedly written by a person named Satoshi Nakamoto, which roughly means ""Central Intelligence"" in Japanese.  The team added that Bitcoin Forum, a bitcoin community where Nakamoto used to communicate, usually removes posts connecting bitcoin with CIA. Raising suspicions about his identity, Nakamoto has never left even a single personal identification clue in his numerous posts on Bitcoin Forum over the years. CIA Project alleges that this shows 'intelligence training'.  In addition, Gavin Bell (aka Gavin Andresen), who is the public face of bitcoin, claims that he has been communicating with Nakamoto for many years. However, Gavin has neither met Nakamoto nor spoken with him on the phone even once. Nevertheless, the anonymity of the alleged bitcoin creator, Nakamoto, cannot be viewed a valid point to base the claim. In addition, Nakamoto is a common Japanese name, and the group's arrived translation is coincidental.  Another evidence the group is trying to bring is related to the source code of the digital currency. It says the common programme used by most cryptocurrencies to create secure keys is suspected to be back-doored by the NSA, citing a ""recent WikiLeaks document"". Bitcoin did not use the most popular programme to create secure keys, and the fact shows that the NSA already had full information about bitcoin, according to the group. ""While bitcoin believers portray bitcoin as a new decentralised currency, the command structure of bitcoin core development is 100% centralised,"" CIA Project says.  The claim could be refuted as bitcoin's source code is open source, and therefore the NSA need not put a back door in the code. The programme that bitcoin uses to secure transactions, SHA-256, is created by the NSA. The open source programme is said to be one of the most secure algorithms in the world.   <end>",

However, not everybody at the NSA is on board with this strategy. Tor developer Andrew Lewman says even as flaws in Tor are rooted out by the NSA and British counterpart GCHQ, other agents from the two organizations leak those flaws directly to the developers, so they can be fixed quickly. He said, ""You have to think about the type of people who would be able to do this and have the expertise and time to read Tor source code from scratch for hours, for weeks, for months, and find and elucidate these super-subtle bugs or other things that they probably don't get to see in most commercial software.""

Cannabis Road 2,TheBestCannabis,526,2014-08-01T17:59:39,What does *CLEARNET WARNING* before links mean?,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"The *Clearnet* warning came about because on some older browsers/setups it would be possible to click a link in a TOR browser and have it open automatically in a clearnet browser.  The intention, at least originally, was rather to make certain people opened the link manually through TOR, and not through their clearnet browser.  Theoretically, going to clearnet links that you saw on the darknet is a way to easily get deanonymized.  If I were in law enforcement, for example, I may post a link to a law-enforcement controlled clearnet server on a vendor's discussion forum. Something like  www.fakedruginformationdomainname.com/stuff. The law enforcement could then look at all the people who accessed that very specific LEO-controlled domain and correctly ascertain that ALL of them were vendors or darknet-related IP addresses.  So to summarize: Never ever open any clearnet links you find on the darknet on your clearnet browser, KEEP IT IN TOR, where you are (at least we hope) mostly safe. ",

Cannabis Road 2,fordfiesta,275,2014-06-08T20:55:48,"HOW TO USE CANNABIS ROAD AS A BUYER 1 (TOUR, MESSAGING, BASIC PGP INFO, WALLET)",Official Market Announcements/Tutorials," NOW YOU'VE REGISTERED ON CANNABIS ROAD If Not the Tutorial for Registering to Cannabis Road is Here  http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/index.php?topic=266.0    HOW TO USE CANANBIS ROAD AS A BUYER (QUICK TOUR, MESSAGING, SIMPLE SITE BASED PGP ENCRYPTION, BITCOIN WALLET) TUTORIAL PART 1    So let's start with the Homepage: http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/    Just a  QUICK TOUR OF THE HOMEPAGE to explain the  functionnalities of all the tabs first.   TOP RIGHT You have access below your Welcome Username to  Your Profile and the  log out button. You'll also want to  check the Welcome phrase you set up in your profile to be sure it's what you set and that you're really where you want to be.    THE NAVIGATION BAR    *HOME Ovious: Takes you to the homepage   *ABOUT US The Cannabis Road Mission statement    *MESSAGES You'll have  your mail box here. If a  small number appears next to MESSAGES in the Nav Bar  you have Mail and should click on the message page   Obviously the number tells you the number of unread messages you have.  I'll explain the message page here so go ahead and  click on MESSAGE (it refers to  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/message )  You'll see next to  Messages : Recipient  Start New Conversation   Recipient is to be  replaced by the username of the person  you wish to communicate with. The other (and  more practical way) to send a message to a vendor is to do it  through the vendor profile's page (will be explained below in the Profile section.)  The same  window opens whatever way used:  SEND MESSAGE TO VENDOR USERNAME  You will have a  first frame with   VENDOR PGP Key and something like this below: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG v2017 MingW32  mQxg(lots of characters)ghaV/cA== =cyYP -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  If you already master PGP Encryption and Messaging you will find here your vendors key.  Copy it paste it to a .txt file and import it with you PGP program It will be for sending double encrypted messages from your program with both the vendor and your user key rather than using the integrated Cannabis Road encryption system (actually what they recommend)  If you didn't understand crap of the previous paragraph ignore it for the time and read the Tutorial on the use of PGP on Cannabis Road. Just  DON'T PLACE AN ORDER Without using PGP Encryption it's a risk to you and to the Vendor!!!  Below that is the  MESSAGE window:   Type here your messages.   You can send plain basic unencrypted messages for general questions just to speak with the vendor when nothing sensitive is shared (amounts, your address or location, etc...)   BUT The best practice is to first of all follow the Vendors guidelines in his profile if he has any (we'll see below how to get to the Vendor Profile). If nothing is mentionned it is best  to encrypt everything (at least basic encryption - see below) That's why  you'll be needing a PGP Key (see the tutorial on that)   For general non sensitive messages I use just  the basic encryption system implemented on the road that only  encrypts the message with the Vendors PGP Key. Works like this:  Just  type in normally your text in the message box.  Then go to the bottom right of the box and  click on ENCRYPT (ONLY ONCE!).  Your plain  text will be transformed into something like: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  hQExx...dgjy= =H3jt -----END PGP MESSAGE-----   That's your encrypted message.   Then Just  press SUBMIT to send the message and it's all done.    For more sensitive information (like your address!!! or discussing stealth),  you'll need to use your own PGP program (I use GNU Privacy Assistant for example and a Tutorial will be on that).  It will allow you to encrypt your message with the vendor and your key making it harder for people to decrypt it basically - safer.  In this case  you'll have to encrypt your message in your PGP program and then  copy paste the PGP encrypted message in the message window and just  press SUBMIT (Do NOT PRESS ENCRYPT IN THIS CASE). Will be explained in PGP tutorial.  Now you've seen how to send a message   Lets continue to where messages live:    THE MAILBOX  Your  Messages should now appear in your mailbox (no In and Out box here just one Mail box)  The  Name of the persons you sent messages to or received from should  appear left.   Next to it the  View Conversation will take you to the mailbox and  show all the message history with that seller. You have the possibility  on that page to  delete individual messages and also the possibility to  send a message to a seller from that thread. A  red color code next to view conversation  indicates unread messages and a  gray color code with ""Replied"" indicates  threads where you are the last to have replied.  Back to the general mailbox,  next to user message history you have a  Delete Button that will delete all messages with the user and  remove the message line from the mailbox. This is a non recoverable action as many actions on the darknet, so be careful.  Next to that  you have the possibility to  mark again a message as unread so it will appear red again next to the ""View Conversation"".   *  WALLET  This is where all the financial part is done:  To explain the wallet concept you need to understand that this doesn't work like ebay or amazon...  Here on CannabisRoad  you first need to load money (BitCoins in our case)  to the website Market Wallet before you can spend it on the site to buy stuff.  There are also some specificities due to the use of Bitcoin as a currency. If you saw an item that costs 100$ the seller set its price to 100$ for him to receive the amount of BTCs worth 100$ at the time of the purchase. So it is actually billed to you in BTC at the current BTC/$ exchange rate that can be found on the left hand side at the bottom of the frames  (prices are also shown in $ and BTC when you place the order.  Since Bitcoin exchange rates fluctuate (sometimes a lot) and that the amount on your wallet is in Bitcoins, Over time you could have your wallet amount that was worth 100$ being worth more than 100$ (not a problem for your purchases..) or less than 100$ (kind of crappy when you don't have enough in your wallet to buy anymore ). It's always  safe to transfer a little bit more Bitcoins than stated on the Product page  in case the rates go the the wrong way to not get screwed when you want to buy your product.  You also need to  bear in mind that there are small Cannabis Road Bitcoin transfer fees, which are stated on the Wallet page also so you need to  take that amount into account when transfering BTC.  When you  deposit BTC into your Cannabis Road Wallet you will actually  receive 0.0001 BTC less than the amount you transfered from your wallet.  When you transfer BTC  withdraw out of the Cannabis Road Wallet into another of your wallets you will  receive 0.0001 BTC less into your wallet than the amount you transfered out of Cannabis Road as a fee.  The  minimum amount you can transfer into or out of your Cannabis Road wallet is 0.0002 BTC (Which would become 0.0001 BTC after the fees).  You will find your  balance statement on this page under  BTC Balance. Your  Bitcoin balance is also converted  in your currency you set in your Profile under  Cash Balance.   Below this you will see  slots for 5 Deposit Addresses (whch are basically like 5 wallet addresses linked to your Cannabis Road Wallet)  They  will initially be empty SO you need to  hit the GENERATE KEY for your Addresses to appear in the boxes that are empty (as many times as you want addresses, max being 5)   They  will look something like this: 1FTYtwG2PR3ruYvtK8tRT2wvbXYV1N4PSK  Above them you will also be able to see the  total amount of BTC transfered to each address. Your generated key will be the  address you will need to type in as a destination address for your transfers into the C Road wallet.   Next to the addresses you have a  x with Delete that will  delete the account line and unlink it form your Cannabis Road wallet.  Be  very careful when doing this of two things: 1/  That all funds you have transferred to your Cannabis Road wallet through this BTC address  have been Fully Processed and have been effectively credited to your account.  2/ Of  never using that address again to transfer BTC to your wallet, because the  BTC would never arrive to you and would be lost to you.    A Few things to know about BTC. When you will  transfer an amount of bitcoins from your personnal wallet or from the site where you bought them to one of the deposit addresses it will have a delay.  It will need a certain amount of ""confirmations"" to allow the transfer. You'll need  at least 3 confirmations for it to be processed in your C Road wallet.  To know when your transfer is effective and complete you need to  go to http://blockchain.info  and  type in the address of the deposit address you used to see the number of confirmations. (or type in this url  http://blockchain.info/address/ depositaddressyouused)  You will see a  new page which will give you the informations you need. You should have your  sending address(es) Green ARROW receiving address and 2 boxes, one saying X (Number) Confirmations (Unconfirmed Transaction at very first) and another stating the amount of BTCs being transfered.  IT IS ONLY  WHEN THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMATIONS REACHES 3 THAT YOUR BTCs WILL BE TRANSFERED AND  USABLE IN YOUR C ROAD WALLET.    WITHDRAWING BTC  Fill in the  WITHDRAWAL ADDRESS with the  destination BTC Wallet Fill in the  AMOUNT TO WITHDRAW  (use the dot . as the decimal not the comma , )  TYPE IN YOUR PIN   -   THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THIS AND NOT LOSE IT OR YOUR MONEY WOULD BE STUCK IN YOUR WALLET Type the  VERIFICATION CODE Captcha Click  WITHDRAW FUNDS    * FORUM  Links to the Forum http://forumzxmoorof4ja.onion/  It is most important you browse the forum regularly to read about Vendors and are aware of Scam Warnings or concerns that could exist with vendors. It is also essential you contribute to the forums to make the community safer and stronger as more feedback on vendors comes in on the site and forum. You've entered a bright new world of choice, good prices and 1g being really 1g not .6g... But this is not eBay you need to be careful, use basic buyer common sense (as you would in a thrift store - too good to be true usually is)   * SUPPORT Allows you to  create a NEW TICKET with the Support Crew You'll need to chose the  type of ticket SUBJECT among: -  Account Support for anything related to your account duh... -  Buyer Support for help about buying on the site or reporting problems, bad practices of a Vendor or a Scam,etc...

Cannabis Road 2,kwikeemart,368,2014-06-29T18:07:30,any examples of them busting darknet weed vendors?,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security, In Canada it is a Schedule 3 drug and even larger busts usually end up in time spent community service and fine for first time offenders. We have a long time customer that claims he orders 2lbs from USA it got seized at customs and he never received a seizure letter or got raided. He said the tracking number stayed active for 6+ months and it just sat in customs. LSD and mushrooms are also a schedule 3. Still to say you do not want the wrong border gaurd to pick up your product or RCMP detective to be on your case as legally it is still punishable as time in jail.  Remember its illegal to j walk its done millions of times a day due to the belief it is not punishable. It sucks when you are the one who gets a cop who is slightly overzealous and hands out a ticket for it. Dealing or trafficking any substance is illegal and though what you offer may be deemed not bad all it takes is a detective who despises what you do and it can get you time in a federal prison. Stay safe and just treat your operation like you will be busted if you do not do everything in your power to avoid capture.  Slow methodical decisions to keep your freedom is needed and I hope we all stay safe. We offer a service that has the potential to end the violence real world drug trading creates though it is a better alternative legally that is not taken into account so keep on fighting for whats right and good cops will soon realize prosecuting DN markets is useless because they are sending the wrong people to jail. We truly are committing a victimless crime and once prosecutors and LE realize this maybe they will grow a pair of real balls and go after the shady men with GUNS and drugs. Not us easy going people.,"Its way too much of an assumption to think we are less of a priority than vendors of other drugs.  We are all targets, and I include customers as well.  If we think of how triumphant LE was when Silk Road was taken down, only to have tons of new sites pop up almost overnight, anything LE can do to scare people off the markets will be done.  I can't speak so much for other countries, but the DEA is virulently anti-pot in the USA.  They have convinced themselves that it has no medicinal value, its a ""gateway"" drug, and every other myth you can think of, including that pot promotes ""deviance"" (I assume that means things like bestiality or, heaven forbid, communism).For us to let our guards down now would be sheer folly.  From the busts I've seen, LE is fishing around for whoever they can get.  And the way they get us is when we let our guards down, even for just one transaction, so that a customer we may have known for months or even years all the sudden doesn't have access to enough bitcoin and ""is there any other way they can pay us this time?""  Never let your guard down, even with your best customers.  Explain to them that its for their protection too, because if you are caught LE will likely keep your account open so they can collect customer addresses as well.  Never weaken OPSEC, only strenghten it, and don't think because you made a mistake in the past it doesn't matter to do so again."

It is also quite possible they had a shipping error and was intended to return to sender but had to manually sort the package. I know the far majority of packages in Canada are automatically sorted and are viewed from a distance when leaving the country. So maybe if it has a hand written address or too small of font it went to manual sorting and may have been stamped their.  On a side note I have never heard of packages being profiled with a voided stamps stamp. There is definitely a good explanation for it and it is not you are under investigation. They would of seized the package or done a controlled delivery they would not have profiled it and then decided to give it to you hassle free. I would not think to much about it as it does not sound very serious and nothing seems to far out of the ordinary.,"Hmmm.So actually I should be worried about the one that WAS VOIDED then maybe...Thanks for the information!And so I shouldn't resell on ebay the unused canadian stamps then But had I ever went to canada I would have probably reused the stamps there.In my country, if the stamp wasn't voided it's the postmans fault and you could reuse the stamp without any further problem.

Cannabis Road 2,kwikeemart,378,2014-06-28T02:12:24,Canadian Postage Unmarked stamps...,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security, They never void the stamps in Canada unless it is being returned. It is a federal offense with a minimum fine of a very large amount to try to reuse stamps I believe. So returned mail will be stamped with RETURN TO SENDER and a bunch of other small markings. Otherwise all incoming Local and International mail has never been stamped when I have received it.  Also you can always phone Canada Posts toll free number they would answer this question and it is no way incriminating at all.,"Hi,This is something that has been going through my head for a while as it doesn't seem right to me...Has anyone received a shipment from Canada where the postage stamps hadn't been voided by the date mark???I first received a package a while ago on SR2 from a Canadian seller and was surprised to see that the stamps were unmarked and like new... No date mark etc...I had imagined that maybe the seller had a way to bypass a part of the postal process.But this has happened several times since from different Canadian vendors of which some on C Road.So the questions are:* Has anyone experienced this also? If yes was it receiving overseas from Canada or domestic?* To Canadians, have you ever had this happen with regular mail also.Basically I don't know what to think of this...a) Candian post is lazy/overworked/doesn't give a shitb) can be easily bypassedc) LE uses this somehow to mark lettersa) and b) would suit me fine c) would bother me... (Maybe they even put RFID chips inside my weed and are tracking my RFIDed weed smoke Thanks for letting me know if this just happened with me or if it is common (also never has happened to me with stuff coming from any other country)PS: If you think this shouldn't be public (Lupo or Crypto especially) tell me and I'll remove the post (or do it yourself if you have admin rights)"

Cannabis Road 2,pothead,473,2014-07-18T13:25:50,Tutorial on how to install Tails onto a USB drive,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials,"Greetings fellow potheads Here is a good read  Tutorial On How to install Tails onto a USB drive.  Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.  Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked.  Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis.""  You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.  1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html  1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -  https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key  2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/  3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer     3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer     3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)     3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)     3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)     3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least.  4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  Booting from a USB drive: ------------------------------------- If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue.  Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). (Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version)  http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/  For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read  http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm  If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/  I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...  https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin  Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional.  7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.      7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""           7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)           7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.       8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.  9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)      9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!""           9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.           9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.       10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.       11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).       Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)  If you have any relevant information pertaining to this topic, feel free to update and improve upon it. This was a response in the original thread (by Meatgrinder) that I feel is worth posting, using the dvd/usb method as an alternative to the 2 usb method of installing Tails.  I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1.  I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted.  Booted into tails, hit Applications' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer' then clone and install (as directed above)  It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader.  Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to ""Applications -> Tails -> Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it.   Installing tails via VM:  If you don't have a DVD drive or burner or DVD's to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine. It would go something like this: 1) Download latest tails iso from:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file 3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso 4) Insert a USB flash drive 5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead 6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer 7) Click ""Clone & Install""   Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written 9) Click ""Create Live USB"" 10) Click ""Next"" 11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK""  That's it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USB  ***Disclaimer I found this on pandoras forum***   ",

Cannabis Road 2,PyroWolf,619,2014-08-19T07:40:43,Ethereum: Making the Entire World Trustless,Cannabis Road Discussion/Legal,"From  DDW <--*clearnet*  Huuuge text wall, but interesting bathroom reading  /PW     Ethereum: Making the Entire World Trustless (Part 1  Introduction)  POSTED BY: EVAN FAGGART       AUGUST 18, 2014       We all know about the radical potential that Bitcoin has to make the worlds monetary system trustless. Bitcoin is already, in itself, completely trustless. There is no central authority that governs over the issuance of Bitcoin or the regulation of its supply. It is scarce; bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air, unlike the fiat currencies we are currently forced by law to use. Even transactions with Bitcoin are trustless. Once a payment is sent, it cannot be retrieved in any way. Therefore, it cannot be double spent. The transaction is confirmed by randomly chosen miners in a matter of minutes. There is no middle man, no bank or credit card company, that you have to put your faith in. The topic of Bitcoins impact on the structure and operation of government has been widely discussed in the Bitcoin community. The main source of government power is its monopoly on money. With the sole authority to issue money create arbitrarily and infinitely, governments can pay for anything they want. They can wage endless wars over politics and natural resources, or they can fund massive welfare states to keep the citizens complacent and subservient. Bitcoin can change all that. By decentralizing the money supply, governments lose their monopoly control over it. Furthermore, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult to track, essentially rendering the governments power of compulsory taxation moot. Consequently, governments would rely on voluntary donations to continue operations, meaning that they actually have to provide value to society. This change in the operation of governments would make them completely voluntary, which many argue would make them completely obsolete. But Bitcoin cannot fully decentralize all aspects of society, however. Even if it can render violent governments impotent, Bitcoin does not do very much in terms of creating decentralized social structures outside of the realm of money. Here is where Ethereum will fill the gap. Ethereum is not a crypto-currency, it is not even a monetary system. It isnt a website, or any kind of social network. Ethereum is a platform. That is all Ethereum is. It is a platform based on smart contracts that allow for the funding and implementation of any type of project. The only limitations are those limits on the imaginations of the people using Ethereum. Simply put, Ethereum is a decentralized development platform that provides a trustless system of contracts and project implementation. This distributed development platform operates on Ether, the built in unit of payment in the Ethereum network. The Ethers could, of course, end up being a currency. However, the potentialities of Ethereum are so grand that the Ether will likely serve as a means of digitally signing contracts and verifying escrow transactions that release other currencies, like Bitcoin, into the possession of the person who has completed the contracted job. The main building block of Ethereum is the smart contract, which is a decentralized, trustless contract that exists within the Ethereum network. They are verified by using Ethers to confirm transactions and are limited only by what the developers using this platform can imagine, as was mentioned before. And the things that have so far been imagined are simply stunning! Here is a list of a few things that are possible within the Ethereum network that are listed on the platforms official website: Create a currency and issue shares. Contracts, law, and escrow. Financial instruments and derivatives. Decentralized organizations (DAOs). Decentralized voting. Decentralized data storage. These are only a few basic things that are listed on Ethereums website. The possibilities are literally endless. The concept is so simple yet elegant; a decentralized system of contracts that can be used to create anything that is desired. However, the development process is extremely complex. This project is the cutting edge of decentralization technology, far outweighing that of the various crypto-currencies, despite their constant growth and improvement. It is essentially impossible to cover all of the things that can be done on Ethereum, because literally anything that is contract-based can be done. So let us imagine what the operation of a city would look like on the Ethereum network. Imagine that a neighborhood or city has a social contract outlined in a digital format on Ethereum. The contract would guarantee things that normal governments provide today, such as water and electricity. However, this social contract would be completely voluntary, there would be no forced taxation of violent enforcement of the rules, or lawsif they could be called laws under this system. An individual moving into the area would consent to this social contract by sending an Ether to an address that is owned by a company or agency responsible for supplying and maintaining the utility in question, whether it be water, power, sewer, telephone, etc. This transaction would set another transaction in motion, in which the person who has newly confirmed his or her consent to the social contract puts the necessary payment into an escrow service, which would of course operate on Ethereum. The company would then turn on the water, power, etc. in this persons house. Once the utility has been turned on, the person confirms the transaction by approving the release of his funds from the escrow account. The process repeats in the next payment cycle. If the utility company turns on the power but the resident does not release the money from escrow, the company simply turns the power off. There is no force involved, everyone is responsible for their actions. Failure to comply with the explicitly agreed upon contract results in a revocation of the services provided under the contract. This scenario seems like a much more peaceful method of conducting society indeed! Ethereum is still in the development stages at this point, so there are no empirical facts currently available about the efficacy of this system. So all we can do is speculate and theorize, which is what we have been doing above. However, if Ethereum is successfully implemented, the situation described in the previous paragraph could indeed become a reality, along with an infinite set of other social and economic organizations. If it can be imagined, and built based on a system of decentralized contractswhich everything can be, theoreticallythen it can be done on Ethereum. The second part will discuss in potentials, Btc-Etherum and implementations.",

Cannabis Road 2,Saul Goodman,6,2014-02-26T03:42:51,Money Laundering and You- an Introduction,Cannabis Road Discussion/Legal,"What is money laundering? ========================== Simply speaking, money laundering is the process by which 'dirty' money is turned into 'clean' money. In simpler terms it is turning money which might be risky to spend into money that you can spend with little to no legal risk.  NB: Simply tumbling your BTC does not constitute laundering as it does not provide you with a reasonable explanation regarding the origins of the funds.  When looking at complex systems it is useful to break them down into their component parts. In the case of money laundering we can break it down into three steps;      * Placement - Where the funds are transformed into something we can easily manipulate.     * Layering - Where the funds are manipulated in such a way that it is difficult, or impossible, to determine their origins.     * Integration - Where the funds are integrated back into a income stream looking like legitimate income.  Let's look at each of these steps more in depth.  Placement =========== Whether we are starting with cold hard cash or some other kind of funds, we need to transform this into something which we can manipulate in the way of our choosing. Traditionally this meant getting cash into the banking system. In modern times this can mean transforming the funds into digital currencies such as Bitcoin or a derivative thereof.  Layering =========== Once money is in a form that we can manipulate we will then have to manipulate them in a way such that their origins are obscured. This traditionally meant international bank transfers through countries with strong bank secrecy laws. With digital currencies this step does not need to involve banks and can be done quicker.  Integration ============ Now that the origins of the funds have been obscured they need to be integrated back into your life in a way that masks them as legitimate income. Traditionally this meant owning a cash intensive business, and slowly infiltrating the money into the legitimate cash stream by making fake sales. It should be noted that this particular method includes all three steps in one (It does however rely upon you owning and operating a profitable, or close-to, cash heavy business).  Why do we want to launder the money we have? ============================================= Funds gained through illicit means can not easily be used to purchase the more substantial assets one might need in life (e.g. real estate, cars, investments, etc.), this is where money laundering comes in. The end-result of properly laundered money is a legal income stream that you can declare to the government and pay taxes on. The latter part being the most important one. Remember; they got Al Capone on Tax Evasion.  The reason for making it an income stream is a matter of camouflage. You want to blend in to the masses, and not raise any suspicion. Think of how most people acquire and use money these days: They are paid a salary for a job and pay for any expenses with a credit-/debit card and/or with a national bank account.  Anonymous debit cards from offshore banks are only good for paying for operational expenses related to your illicit activity, they should not be your only source of funds as it does not offer an explanation regarding the source of the aforementioned funds.  Always remember that money laundering is all about camouflaging yourself financially to avoid suspicion and to 'throw of the scent'. It should be part of a larger OPSEC regiment, but that topic is beyond the scope of this introduction. ",

Once you get to the finalization screen you'll see 2 boxes.   1) Raw transaction 2) Constructed transaction.  The raw transaction is mainly there for your inspection purposes. It will contain;  1) Where the funds are being sent to once processed 2) Where the funds are coming from (the shared address) 3) Proof that sufficient funds exist in that address by providing the transaction IDs of the payments to that address  You can view this breakdown by taking that raw transaction and putting decoderawtransaction in front of it and pasting it in your Bitcoin QT console.  It would look something like this;  decoderawtransaction 00001111000001111100000, etc.....  And the result would be a breakdown things like address, amount, txid, for those who want to inspect it.  Secondly the constructed transaction basically is a prefilled out command you're going to enter into your console that is going to add your signature to the raw transaction.  The only thing you need to change is where it says YOURPRIVATEKEYHERE, you need to replace that with your compressed private key and then hit enter.  You'll get a result that looks something like this.   Except your hex output is going to be much bigger. Copy that hex output and disregard everything else. So you would be copying only the  010000002222000000000000...etc  This hex result is the raw transaction with your signature added to it.

Cannabis Road 2,Crypto,372,2014-06-26T18:18:29,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials," At this point the seller will enter their  private key, which is basically providing 1 of the 2 required signatures to release the funds.   Finally the market will provide it's  private key automatically to release the funds to the seller.   At this point the funds will be released to the seller.  So remember, the only important things you need to perform this are.  Compressed public key Compressed private key A personal Bitcoin address for your funds to be sent to. This can be your Blockchain wallet, your Bitcoin Fog wallet, any wallet.  Public keys are used to generate the multisig address. Private keys are used to spend or release the funds from the multisig address.",
Cannabis Road 2,Crypto,372,2014-06-26T18:14:52,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials,"Ok so back to Multisignature addresses.  A multisignature address is generated having the following goals in mind.    1) In order to spend funds in a normal Bitcoin wallet, you need the private key. In order to spend funds in a multisignature wallet you may need multiple keys. What do I mean by  may need?  When generated multisignature addresses you can choose how many private keys are required to spend the funds. So for example you can use 2 public keys to generate the multisig address, and require only 1 private key to spend them. This seems like a stupid idea since it defeats the purpose of  MULTISIGNATURE addresses, but technically you could.   A better idea is to generated a multisig addresses with 2 public keys that require 2 private keys to spend the funds. This is a little bit more safer because it requires both the buyer and the seller to agree on the transaction in order to release the funds. The problem is, if a buyer or seller has a dispute or one is trying to scam the other, they may never agree to provide their private key to release the funds. This is where we come in at Cannabis Road.   We use what's described as a 2 of 3 multisig address.   The buyer supplies a public key, the seller supplies a public key and the market supplies a public key.  The multisig address is then set up to require 2 private keys to spend the funds. This way, if the buyer and seller can't agree on who should get the funds, the market can be the tie breaker and settle the dispute.   This protects the  buyer from a scammer  seller This protects the  seller from a scammer  buyer This protects the  buyer and  seller from a scamming  market.   The reason is because no one individual has more than 1 private key, and 2 are required to spend the funds. So therefore everyone is protected from everyone else and the market can handle the tie breakers in case of a buyer/seller dispute.   So let's recap what we learned so far.   Buyer's public key Seller's publc key Market's public key  Are all put together to make 1 multisig address that requires 2 out of the 3 private keys to spend the funds.   So once the new multisig address is generated, this is where the buyer will send their funds.  Then once the buyer receives their item or the seller requests early finalisation, the seller will first provide their private key, then the buyer will provide their private key and the funds will be released to the seller.  It really is not very complicated, but I have seen alot of people complaining about how complicated it is.   Now that we talked about the theory of multisig, let's show you how you apply this to Cannabis Road.",

Secondly the constructed transaction basically is a prefilled out command you're going to enter into your console that is going to add your signature to the raw transaction.  The only thing you need to change is where it says YOURPRIVATEKEYHERE, you need to replace that with your compressed private key and then hit enter.  You'll get a result that looks something like this.   Now, you will notice, that in the case of the broadcast method, unlike the sign and return method, it says ""complete"" : true instead of false.  This is because in the sign and return method the seller is adding their signature first, and the market will add it's signature second. So the complete false, is just basically saying, WE STILL NEED OUR SECOND SIGNATURE before this transaction is complete.  In the broadcast method, the seller is adding the second signature, so you will get the complete : true.  So just like the sign and return method, copy that hex output and disregard everything else. So you would be copying only the  010000002222000000000000...etc  This hex result is the raw transaction with your signature added to it. You have completed the ""sign"" portion, now you just need to  broadcast it  At this point you are still using your Bitcoin QT client, and you are going to broadcast your own transaction to the bitcoin network.   This is where it becomes important to make sure your Bitcoin QT client is connected through Tor, because the Bitcoin network will be saving your IP address when you broadcast the transaction. If you don't know how to do this, look about 2 posts above this one and you will see instructions on how to connect your Bitcoin QT client through Tor. Also this is the main reason why people may opt to perform the sign and return method instead of broadcasting their own transaction, because it makes the market doing the broadcasting instead.  To broadcast your own transaction take your copied hex output    010000002222000000000000...etc  And enter;  sendrawtransaction 010000002222000000000000...etc  Into the Bitcoin QT console. The result will be a transaction ID that you can view on Blockchain.info to verify the transaction has been successfully picked up by the Bitcoin network.  If you get a ""FALSE"" result, you have likely incorrectly entered your private key.  Another downside to the broadcast method, is that the speed of which your transaction is confirmed may be slower because you must wait for your transaction to be picked up by the majority (at least 51%) of the Bitcoin network, and most Bitcoin QT clients are connected to about 8 other Bitcoin nodes.  The market's client is connected to dozens of nodes and your transaction will spread quicker if you use the sign and return method.  But if you wish to have the most control over your transaction, the broadcast method is for you.","""hex"" : ""010000002222000000000000.....etc"",""complete"" : true}"
Cannabis Road 2,Crypto,372,2014-06-26T18:25:08,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials," There are a few things to understand with the  sign and return method and the  broadcast method.  You're going to need a Bitcoin client of some sort, preferrably  Bitcoin QT, although it should be emphasized that you should be connecting  Bitcoin QT through  Tor.  To do this, open Bitcoin QT and go to Settings, then Options, then Network.  You must have Tor or Tor Browser Bundle open at this point.    The proxy IP will be 127.0.0.1 and the port will be 9150, and the socks version will be 5.  Next, you're going to need to execute commands in the console. To do this click Help, then Debug Window.  This is where you enter your commands for the 2 methods in questions.",
Cannabis Road 2,Crypto,372,2014-06-26T18:16:49,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials,"Buyer makes a purchase on Cannabis Road and places their order and is presented with their total.  Under  My Account -> My Placed Orders  It will say  Require Buyer's Action - Resolve  Click on Resolve and you will be presented with an address to send your market fee to.   First thing the buyer has to do is send a 4% market fee directly to the market. This is because there's no good way of making sure the market gets their fees using multisig unless the buyer sends their market fee first to the market.  After the market receives their fee, the buyer will be asked for their public key and their refund address.  You can generate your public key and private key pair at BitAddress.org or BrainWallet.org.  The  refund address is where funds will be returned if there is a dispute of which you are the winner.   Next the seller will be asked for their public key and their address to where the funds will be sent once the order is finalized.   Finally the market generates their public key and combines it with the other public keys to generate a multisignature address.   The buyer and seller will be presented with the multisg address and all 3 public keys in case they want to verify that the address was generated using those 3 public keys. Most people don't need to do this, but some people demand that they have access to all the keys to make sure the market isn't trying to scam them.  The buyer will then be asked to send the remaining 96% of the order's cost to the multisig address.   Next the seller will be asked to either ship the item or the buyer can finalize early.   Once the buyer finalizes, the seller will be presented with three options.  1) Private Key method 2) Sign and Return method 3) Broadcast method  These 3 methods will be discussed in detail in subsequent posts.",
Cannabis Road 2,Crypto,372,2014-06-26T18:14:16,How to use the Multisignature Payment System,Official Market Announcements/Tutorials,"Hey all.   So you wanna make a payment using the new multisignature system? Most people are getting scared away by this and we have been reading posts on Reddit and other forums about how buyers are getting intimidated by the multisig system because it's too complicated. Well my goal is to set your mind at ease by explaining it to you as if you were a retard. No offense meant.    First of all, let's look at a normal Bitcoin address. You can generate unlimited Bitcoin addresses at   https://www.bitaddress.org/  http://brainwallet.org/  On BitAddress you can click ""Generate new Address"" a bunch of times, until you are happy.  On the left hand side, you'll see a  Bitcoin address and on the right hand side you'll see a  private key.  Copy the private key, and click on the tab  Wallet Details and paste it in the box where it says  Enter Private Key and click  View Details.  You're gonna see a bunch of numbers pop up. Uncompressed address, public key and private key. As well as compressed address, public key and private key.   The private key is what you use to spend your funds. If you've ever used any Bitcoin client other than Blockchain, you know that the private key is the only really important number you need, the rest can be generated from the private key.   The difference between compressed and uncompressed is that compressed takes us less space in the Blockchain. Most people don't know this, but each transaction in Bitcoin is a certain size and for those of you who use Bitcoin QT, you know how long it takes to download the entire Blockchain every time you install it on another computer.  If you go to  https://blockchain.info/ you can see what I mean. On the right hand side you'll see for each block,  Size (kB)   Well, compressed keys and addresses take up less space in the Blockchain, so they were designed so that the Blockchain doesn't get too big too quickly. So for the forseeable future, we're gonna use compressed addresses, public keys and private keys.  So you're gonna wanna select these numbers for your Bitcoin wallet (but use the numbers you generated)   Public Key (compressed, 66 characters [0-9A-F]): 02F4027E28BC285F03CEE44882060408A52EDB4DCC50CFBA6C09E80238FF0E29EA   Bitcoin Address Compressed 1JGPd4o2qMgViGYu54GPyYzcvzCiCnUwYg   Private Key WIF Compressed52 characters base58, starts with a 'K' or 'L' L265ZwzJmGUJ4eJZY1b8qidQjGhYg6gHnxydrKjg3v2bt4Xgso13  With me so far?  All you need to know is to select the compressed versions of the keys every time.   Just a little explanation here, when your private key is generated, a corresponding public key is generated. The private key is your spending key and the public key is your receiving key, but in order to make Bitcoin more manageable, Bitcoin further refined your public key using multiple mathematical equations down into a 27-34 character address.  For those who want an indepth tutorial on how these numbers are generated, read this tutorial.  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses  So for our purposes in multisig, we mainly need the compressed public key and compressed private key, just remember that. The address really isn't important in the case of multisig but I wanted you to understand the addressess' role in Bitcoin wallets first. Nobody uses public keys to receive money because they take up way too much space, so we refined it down to addresses which are about 50% - 75% smaller.  Again, think about how long it takes you to download the Blockchain every time you install Bitcoin QT, saving space is an important goal for Bitcoin.  Ok, now that we have our compressed public key and private key, let's move on to the next step.",
Cannabis Road 2,TheBestCannabis,525,2014-08-01T17:56:03,Tor Service Compromised By Unknown Attackers ,Cannabis Road Discussion/Security,"  The *Clearnet* warning came about because on some older browsers/setups it would be possible to click a link in a TOR browser and have it open automatically in a clearnet browser.   The intention, at least originally, was rather to make certain people opened the link manually through TOR, and not through their clearnet browser.  Theoretically, going to clearnet links that you saw on the darknet is a way to easily get deanonymized.  If I were in law enforcement, for example, I may post a link to a law-enforcement controlled clearnet server on a vendor's discussion forum. Something like  www.fakedruginformationdomainname.com/stuff. The law enforcement could then look at all the people who accessed that very specific LEO-controlled domain and correctly ascertain that ALL of them were vendors or darknet-related IP addresses.   So to summarize: you've got it backwards Pyro! Never ever open any clearnet links you find on the darknet on your clearnet browser, keep it IN TOR, where you are (at least we hope) mostly safe.      Regarding the article, I think this one is primarily directed at hidden service operators, who should probably have a bit of sweaty palm syndrome going on reading that I'm sure. It would take a crazy amount of effort to try to deanonymize a single random tor user in the hope they are someone 'important,' one has to imagine the vast majority of the deanonymization efforts are targeted at the big fish.

The impression is that attackers were apparently not LE, govt, or malicious; so maybe not time to crap pants...yet.   Just a reminder to keep your head on a swivel, and stay frosty out there troops!  Clearnet *www.theverge.com/2014/7/30/5951479/tor-says-unknown-attackers-compromised-hidden-services  <snip:  The Tor encryption service is a high-profile bastion of computer security, but the project appears to have been compromised earlier this year. Today, the Tor Project blog announced that an unknown party likely managed to gather information about people who were looking up hidden services  websites that users can operate and visit anonymously, like Silk Road  and could theoretically have compromised other parts of the network.   Anyone who used Tor between early February and July 4th of 2014 ""should assume they were affected"" by the attack, says the Tor team. But they don't know what exactly that means. The attackers specifically looked for who was retrieving the public keys to hidden services, but they ""likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up),"" says the blog post. ""The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service."" It's possible, but less likely, that they also attempted to identify users who were just browsing the ordinary web through Tor.   >edit: also reported on DeepDotWeb, front page.edit2: corrected erroneous tech detail (see quoted)",

[VPN if used (although the use of VPN is subject to debate and not vital), other programs using the internet closed, and Tor Network Settings tested  https://check.torproject.org/?lang=en_US ] :   1/ REGISTERING TO THE ROAD  Go the the  Cannabis Road url :  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/ This will also be the URL you'll need to use to get to Cannabis Road to login later once you have created your account.  click on the link "" Create one here""at the bottom of the login window in the blue rectangle @  Don't have an account? Create one here. (links to  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/register )    2/ Fill in all the information to REGISTER on the page  a)  Choose a username (really not wise to put your real nickname or the same username as on any clearnet (not Tor .onion) site you use - just in case Law Enforcement got a hand on anything anywhere)  b)  Choose a password and confirm it (here again don't use a password from the clearnet you use for anything else on the Darknet (.onion sites) as a precaution.  c)  CHOOSE A PIN from 4-10 digits. Re-type it below.  VERY VERY IMPORTANT DON'T FORGET OR LOSE YOUR PIN IT WOULD RESULT IN YOUR BITCOIN FUNDS BEING BLOCKED AND LOST FOR YOU! As generally with Bitcoin transactions one of the inconveniences is that many actions are irreversible and have no backup or recovery systems.  Basicaly without your PIN, your Account would be like a Debit Bank Card for which you lost the PIN code and for which you could never retrieve the PIN nor transfer the money from the bank account. Or if that wasn't clear: Without your PIN you're proper fucked, so hold on to it you all    d)  Choose Account Type: Buyer  e)  Type in the numbers from the  Captcha box in the box below  f) Tick the  Agree with Terms and Conditions box and hit the  Submit link below    3/ This should take you back to the LOGIN page at  http://cannabiskofvl7pa.onion/   Login using the username and password you used to register to the road.   Type in the numbers from the Captcha box in the box below ( it's NOT your PIN that you need to type here BUT the 4 lttle numbers in the grey background)  And hit the  SIGN IN link below.    4/ OFFICIALY WELCOME TO CANNABIS ROAD ACCOUNT PROFILE CONFIGURATION   You are now on the market homepage :)Welcome BUT First Things First.  You should  fill in your profile to get the best search results and the account safe and functional as follows:  a)  Click on the link MY ACCOUNT in the top right hand corner of the homepage below the "" Welcome USERNAME ""  Now you are on the  MY ACCOUNT Panel I'll explain the basic functionalities in each of the pages here:   *CHANGE PASSWORD / PIN. Title is quite obvious.  Password AND PIN are necessary to change either Password or PIN. Another Good reason to definitely not lose the PIN.   *MY SHOPPING CART  Where listings you've chosen to order will end up once you've selected the product, Shipping Option, Escrow Method etc... You'll come here to confirm your orders and proceed with payment (escrow) of your order and will be linked to the rest of the process where you place your address etc... This will be explained in a dedicated Tutorial On How to Place an Order shortly.   *MY PLACED ORDERS  Once you'll have ordered your past orders and many actions for feedback, fund release, package reception status will be. It'll be explained in the dedicated Place an Order Tutorial   *MY PGPA VERY VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE.I'll explain it to you in a dedicated Tutorial On How to Place an Order / PGP Encryption how to create a PGP Key and use an encryption program.  In the meantime I urge you  DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER without a PGP key and encryption program, but you can browse and put orders in your shopping cart in the meantime without risk.   In my opinion sending your shipment address to buy without PGP is like going to the brothel and not having a condom...  But you can walk around and just look and you won't catch any diseases, but if you decide to go for it anyways you're risking a lot of nasty diseases.  Might be you won't have any problems, but if you lose you'll bitterly regret it... And most sellers would not do business with you without it anyways (hey just like at the brothel I guess again).  If you already use PGP Encryption I suggest you create a new key for darknet activities if you don't already have a ""dark"" key. You then just need to  click the PGP Key link, copy the public part of the key and hit submit and there you go it's registered  If you didn't undesrtand a word of this paragraph wait for the tutorial and don't buy yet     *ACCOUNT SETTING    This is the part you want to fill in to make the browse comfortable for you around the road.   -COUNTRY : You probably think: Hell no, I won't tell the site... But the use of that information is  to enable the serch filters for domestic vendors and for vendors that send to your country.  So it does come in very handy to search the listings. And you can also Reset it to undisclosed just before you logout everytime so it doesn't stay stocked when your account opens if it makes you feel safer.   -CURRENCY: Choose if you want prices displayed in BTC Bitcoins directly of if you want to see the price in your currency using the exchange rates with USDollar EURos GBPounds CADollars AUDollars and  displaying the price in that currency.  Choose whatever suits you. Leaving BTC will display price in USD in large and in BTC in small (just like if you chose USD actually). Chosing any other Currency will display the chosen currency in large and the BTC price in small on the search pages.   Other useful information: In the bottom left hand side of all of the whole site pages, you'll find a quick exchange rate panel to the above currencies also which comes in quite handy.   -WELCOME PHRASE:Basic anti-phishing protection. Type any chosen phrase and submit and check that it does indeed appear in the top right hand corner just below the ""HELLO USERNAME"" line and above the"" MY ACCOUNT / LOGOUT"" line.  It should appear everytime you login. If it doesn't something is wrong check the URL, close everything recheck the URL, don't buy or withdraw/deposit BTC!!! and then only call the police to explain your cannabisroad account has probably been hacked/phished.   -TWO FACTOR AUTHENTIFICATION: Don't touch this yet if you don't know what this means or really understand PGP two factor encryption nor have inserted a PGP key. All this will be explained in the Tutorial dealing with PGP Encryption. This is  AN EXTRA SAFETY FEATURE which will provide an extra level of protection of your login, it uses your PGP key therefor making you less vulnerable to a hack of your account and having someone connect under your login (they would need your username, password, PIN, AND ALSO The PGP Private part of the Key + the PGP Key Passphrase), but not using it isn't barebacking in the brothel. Read about this in the other Tutorials.      *LOGOUT Well quite obvious what it does, you also have the possibility to logout on every page of the road in the top right hand corner.    THERE YOU GO YOU'VE SETUP YOUR ACCOUNT.   Now you can start gathering bitcoins for the purchases you'll want to buy if you don't already have some, this can be a bit time consuming and as new buyers it often takes 1-2 days for your account to be cleared before the BiTCoins transfer to your C Road Wallet.

Cannabis Road 3,PyroWolf,528,2014-08-02T05:44:00,Iran Blacklists TOR Network,Information Area/Security,"Iran, one of the world?s biggest Internet censors, has begun blocking the Tor network. In the last week, the state-owned Telecommunications Company of Iran has effectively knocked off 75 percent of all Tor traffic in the country.  Tor, an anonymity tool used by millions of people around the world for a wide variety of purposes, is a powerful and popular tool used in Iran used by political activists and citizens looking to get around the country?s strict speech and press laws.  Normally, as many as 40,000 Iranians are using Tor at any given moment. Today, that number has dropped to 10,000 and falling.  Tor, which until recently worked easily with a simple download in Iran, has a long history of battling for anonymity inside of Persia. The software was used effectively and widely during protests in 2009. The government began rolling out a new state-of-the-art Internet censorship system in 2011 in an attempt to build a ?Halal Internet.? Since then, the government has gone after Tor?s promise of anonymity and, consequently, freedom from Iran?s rules in a variety of ways. Combined, Iran?s censorship tools have been labelled the Great Persian Firewall, a nod to China?s similar system of online suppression.  In 2011, Tor and Iran engaged in an arms race, as the government would find a new methods of blocking and Tor?s developers would build new circumvention tools?sometimes even releasing them on the same day the government?s censors built their blocks.  That arms race with Iran, and other censorship regimes around the globe, continues to this day.  Iran?s latest move attempts to block all of the Tor network relays publicly listed by the Tor Project, is not absolute. It takes several more steps to to circumvent Iran?s action. But it is possible.  Iranians can attempt to access Bridges?secret and unlisted Tor relays designed to circumvent censorship that are much more difficult to block?as a hidden path onto the Tor network. Another option for bridges is to email  bridges@torproject.org from either Riseup.net, Gmail or Yahoo, a rule set in place to avoid fake emails being sent.  Users outside of Iran can run a Tor bridge to help circumvent the censorship. We outlined how to run a Tor bridge several months ago when it was the Turkish government trying and failing to block Tor.   Clearnet Source  ",

Cannabis Road 3,Crypto,528,2014-08-10T00:16:29,Iran Blacklists TOR Network,Information Area/Security," Tor has pluggable transports which disguise Tor traffic into something that it's not. Iran right now appears to be blocking the IP addresses of the Tor entry nodes, so there are two options.  #1) Have people host private bridges that are not known to the public, preferrably obfuscated 3 bridges which disguise the traffic completely into randomized traffic.   #2) Flash proxies which are a type of pluggable transport that rotates IP addresses every 5 minutes and thus virtually impossible to block, the downside is that the traffic itself is not obfuscated, so deep packet inspection could still technically analyze the traffic, but I don't know if Iran is this technically advanced yet compared to China.","Quote from: Weedijuana on August 09, 2014, 11:59:21 AMTor is a distinct protocol, it is extremely easy to block.Obfuscated bridges attempt to mitigate this though.Iran is nuts though, I remember a few years back when they banned all ssl encrypted traffic.Is there a way to make a private communications protocol that is very difficult to detect/block, in whatever country, so, not necessarily legal everywhere, but not really illegal either - just private and really hard to find?

Always use a new CR wallet address for every deposit.  Never use them twice.  That's why it tells you how much BTC it has recieved per wallet. Don't delete them though until transactions are fully processed.  Also when you transfer BTC from your legit coinbase to your blockchain account always use a new blockchain account on TOR.  Process:  1.  Buy BTC on coinbase on legit ISP connection as yourself, don't use VPN, TOR, etc. 2.  Log on to VPN+TOR and create a blockchain account anonymously.  Don't even tell it an email address. 3.  Transfer BTC from coinbase to anonymously tor created blockchain account. 4.  Then transfer from anonymously created tor blockchain account to bitcoin fog or just shared send it to your CR wallet.  I think as long as you transferred from coinbase to anonymously created TOR blockchain address and then shared send it over to CR you are probably covered well enough.  If you were a seller I'd say take more precautions.  Oh and use Tails.  Keep it up to date. Have 2 USB keys.  Make a backup file using USB key backup utility and restore it to the 2nd key every time you make persistent changes.  Keep the two keys in seperate physical locations so you cannot lose both at once.     I personally use VPN service on top of windows running tails in a VM.  My ISP cannot see that I am using TOR/Tails then and I am anonymous on TOR.",

Cannabis Road 3,chocolatelove,166,2014-05-15T14:04:05,Vendor Communications,Information Area/Security,"Hey all, I've been looking at various vendor profiles and I came across a vendor who preferred most communicaitons be in plain text, stating it was too time comsuming to decrypt various messages. This rubbed me the wrong way, and I'd like to first explain why, and then ask your opinion on the matter. I say that ALL communication with a vendor should be encrypted. Messages that aren't encrypted could be eavesdropped on or surveilled. The more communications that are collected and gathered about you could eventually remove your anonymity. Spelling mistakes, speech patterns, and more can be used to pick you out of a crowd. Why take the chance?  Also, if we are switching back and forth between encrypted and non-encrypted communications, we are leaving another opening for human error to creep in. Imagine accidentally sending your address unencrypted. No, it is better to get in the habit of ALWAYS using encryption. My freedom is worth more than the extra minute or so it takes to view my encrypted message. If you are a vendor who wants all communications plain text (other than addresses), I'm sorry, but I can't do business with you. I respect your privacy and OpSec, please respect mine.  What are your thoughts? Am I wrong in taking this stand? Thanks for reading",

If we received a couple hundred every day, maybe I'd feel differently. But I don't think so. It seems a lot like wearing a seatbelt. It only takes a second, but it can literally save your life.

Cannabis Road 3,kwikeemart,166,2014-06-29T17:56:10,Vendor Communications,Information Area/Security,Ya all incoming messages are not hard to decrypt. Though not all outgoing messages need to be encrypted. A lot of the time we are not sending out any incriminating information and adding 5 keys to our key chain a day is pointless. But even if a vendor asks you to utilize plain text just use PGP. If they do not have enough time in the day to decrypt your personal sensitive information they probably do not have enough time to package your product properly either.  If they have a million customers and deem it to be to time consuming they should increase the cost of the product they offer turn up the profit per sale and decrease the amount of sales that flow through them. There fore keeping the same profit but doing less work for it. Just my 2 cents stay safe and realize many people were busted from SR1 because they did not use PGP.,

There are of course many different BTC wallets out there, the below is a starting point for your research, proceed carefully        LadyHawke.   BITCOIN CORE is a full Bitcoin client and builds the backbone of the network. It offers the highest levels of security, privacy, and stability. However, it has fewer features and it takes a lot of space and memory.  MUILTIBIT is a lightweight client that focuses on being fast and easy to use. It synchronizes with the network and is ready to use in minutes. MultiBit also supports many languages. It is a good choice for non-technical users.  HIVE is a standalone wallet for Android, which requires no external server or account. It focuses on usability, yet provides a range of advanced features, such as touch-to-pay via NFC or reliable payments via Bluetooth. Hive Android is extensible through plugins.  ARMORY is an advanced Bitcoin client that expands its features for Bitcoin power users. It offers many backup and encryption features, and it allows secure cold-storage on offline computers.  ELECTRUM's focus is speed and simplicity, with low resource usage. It uses remote servers that handle the most complicated parts of the Bitcoin system, and it allows you to recover your wallet from a secret phrase.  BITCOIN WALLET is easy to use and reliable, while also being secure and fast. Its vision is de-centralization and zero trust; no central service is needed for Bitcoin-related operations. The app is a good choice for non-technical people.  MYCELIUM Bitcoin Wallet is an open source wallet for Android designed for security, speed, and ease of use. It has unique features to manage your keys and for cold storage that help you secure your bitcoins.  BLOCKCHAIN.INFO is a user-friendly hybrid wallet. It stores an encrypted version of your wallet online but decryption happens in your browser. For security reasons, you should always use the browser extension and email backups (and keep that email secure) .  BITGO is a multi-signature wallet offering the highest levels of security. Every transaction requires two signatures, protecting your bitcoins from malware and server attacks. Private keys are held by the user such that BitGo cannot access the bitcoins. It is a good choice for non technical users.  GREENADDRESS is a user-friendly multi-signature wallet with improved security and privacy. At no time your keys are server side, not even encrypted. For security reasons, you should always use 2FA and the browser extension or Android App.  COINBASE is a web wallet service that aims to be easy to use. It also provides an Android web wallet app, merchant tools and integration with US bank accounts to buy and sell bitcoins.  COINKITE is a web wallet & debit card service that aims to be easy to use. It also works on mobile browsers, has merchant tools, point-of-sale payment terminals. It is a hybrid wallet and full reserve vault.  ",

Cannabis Road 3,PyroWolf,527,2014-08-02T05:38:41,"WTF?! US GOV""T Increases Funding for TOR + $1.8 Million!",Information Area/Security,"Tor, the internet anonymiser, received more than $1.8m in funding from the US government in 2013, even while the NSA was reportedly trying to destroy the network.  According to the Tor Project?s latest annual financial statements, the organisation received $1,822,907 from the US government in 2013. The bulk of that came in the form of ?pass-through? grants, money which ultimately comes from the US government distributed through some independent third-party.  Formerly known as ?the onion router?, Tor is software which allows its users to browse the internet anonymously. It works by bouncing connections through encrypted ?relays?, preventing any eavesdropper from determining what sites a particular user is visiting, or from determining who the users of a particular site actually are. That makes it popular amongst organisations trying to promote freedom of speech in nations like China and Syria ? but also popular amongst users trying to evade surveillance in the West.  The two largest single grantors of federal money were SRI international, a non-profit research and development centre that aims to bridge the gap between abstract research and industry, and Internews Network, an international non-profit that funds programmes supporting democracy and human rights. The latter gave $555,413 in funding originally from the US Department of State, while the former gave $830,269 in funding ultimately stemming from the US Department of Defense.  The Tor Project also received direct funding from the National Science Foundation and the US Department of State, totalling $100,325 and $256,900 respectively.  The continued funding of Tor by the American government, including (indirectly) the Department of Defense, stands in stark contrast to the Guardian?s revelation in October 2013 that the National Security Agency and GCHQ were attempting to destroy the network. Documents obtained by the Guardian detailed proof-of-concept attacks designed to either bring down the Tor network entirely, or to de-anomymise users.  Despite the NSA?s attacks on the service, federal funding of Tor has actually increased year-on-year. In 2012, the organisation only received $1.2m in funding from the US government, none of which was direct.  Clearnet Source",

Now after you do this with your browser, you will not be able to access some sites which is a huge pain but better safe than sorry. Even after you do that with your browser, it's not enough. Get a VPN service that you have to pay for. Security aint free my friend. Now buy some bitcoin. I used lupojacks advice and got Coinbase.

I have read all kinds of stuff on PGP keys and found the easiest was using Igolder.com stupid ass easy and nothing to DL. Sent my first vendor message today so hopefully that went well. Just make sure you copy and paste your public PGP key in your account. From what I've read, never do business with vendors who use FE as the this site was designed to keep people honest but the digression will go to you after you get to know your vendor.

Cannabis Road 3,AngelEyes,325,2014-07-05T01:33:19,Can someone help me get started?,Information Area/Security,"Great advice here.  Read everything you can get your hands on.  There are tons of tutorials from all sorts of helpful folks here and on many of the other forums like The Hub.  I'd recommend using a non-windows operating system for your darknet activities.  I say this because windows is the least secure OS by far.  If you don't want to go the tails route, which is the safest (and probably easiest as well), you can get free desktop virtualization software from Oracle called VirtualBox.  You can set up a linux virtual system that runs through VirtualBox, download the linux version of Tor and you're good to go.  Also, it really pays to learn PGP.  It may take a little while to get the concepts and functionality down but there are a million tutorials on the darknet forums to help, and you can always ask specific questions as well.  Finally, before ordering from any vendors make sure to not just read their profile and feedback, but read through their forum review thread.  Its vital to do this last because feedback can be spoofed and unless you can hear directly from customers of the vendor you just don't know if they're a scammer or not.  As for FE, I wouldn't do it unless your vendor is trusted.  Even then there have been quite a few trusted vendors that stopped dealing from their vendor accounts and stole tons of coins on their way out the door.  That won't work on you if you don't FE.

I just want to make you all aware of a couple of things, (that you may already know). I have come across references to people using Safe-mail.net in several places and would just like to warn people away from it. Check out below:  http://www.deepdotweb.com/jolly-rogers-security-guide-for-beginners/are-you-using-safe-mail-net/  http://wanderthedark.net/2014/04/15/dont-ever-use-safe-mail-net/ The emails are not encrypted until after they reach the server so any successful warrant can recover clear text of what you send.  I think the future is in systems like:  https://protonmail.ch/ Currently they are not accepting new accounts because they were overwhelmed with demand but you can 'register' for a call back when they have upgraded their servers. These guys are from CERN in Switzerland and they started the project because they were freaked out by the interception of email traffic by security agencies. They have come up with a concept that no other email system employs at present as far as I am aware, the message is encrypted before it reaches their servers so any successful warrant will only receive encrypted files, and any such warrant is hard to obtain under Swiss legislation (they want to protect their banking industry). They check the validity of your application for an account so don't put something stupid like ""I wanna buy drugs""! Put a serious, considered and rational reason forward as to why they should accept your application, remember these people are physicists and academics. Also they are raising funds for their new servers through cloud funding, any small donation you can make will help to bring the project forward. As an aside to the funding route check out what paypal did:  https://protonmail.ch/blog/paypal-freezes-protonmail-campaign-funds/ I am not affiliated in any way to the people developong this system, I just think it is the future for secure, private email communication. As with many other innovations it may never fulfil its potential but we should at least give it a chance to flower and support it as we can. Now the the idea is out of the box I hope and anticipate that it will be duplicated by others, until that happens this is our best hope. Peace and love",

Cannabis Road 3,JackBlue,515,2014-08-16T07:28:50,** RESEARCH ** EMAIL PROVIDERS,Information Area/Tutorials,"anyone using any email whatsoever should be also using Tor and PGP encrypting the content of every message.   If you take those two precautions, it really doesn't matter what the administrators of the email service do, your messages are encrypted end to end and with Tor your location is also hidden.     As far as I know riseup is exactly what they say they are but no one knows for absolutely certain that riseup isn't a US security agency operation.   There really is no way to know that for certain in this day and age.  Furthermore, riseup operates their servers within the physical jurisdiction of the USA.   So even if you use riseup, and i do have a rise-up account, you damn well also must use tor and GPG encrypt all your email end to end, not using the mail provider's SSL for encryption.   Leave the subject line blank because that's never encrypted, and be aware the the address info is also never encrypted.  There was a very simple reason why many vendors and buyers from SR went to safe-mail after tormail was shut down.  I was not relying on their security.  I was relying on the fact that safe-mail allowed you to do several important things that very few providers allow:  1.  safe-mail allowed users to set up new accounts from Tor with no personally identifiable information and no alternate working email address required.    2.  you could also send and retrieve mail and log into your account from Tor.   Most email providers don't let you do either of those things.  I didn't matter at all whether or not safe-mail was protecting me.  I was protecting myself while using safemail.  If you must use email (and there are much more secure alternatives) make sure and follow those steps and be aware of the limitations of your privacy.  Most security experts agree that superior safety (and much easier conversation) can be had with instant messaging, specifically using the jabber protocol (xmpp) over either the pidgin or adium (mac) apps.  With pidgin, you also need to install the OTR (off the record) plugin -- it's built into adium, enable the setting ""require encryption"", and set the connection on the client to use the tor .socks proxy connection (127.0.0.1, port 9150).  Make sure OTR is enabled.  Not only is it probably much safer than email, but the encryption and decryption happens automatically making conversation a lot easier than with email.   if you have a riseup account, they have complete instructions on setting up OTR instant messaging on their web site.   Even if you don't have riseup, follow their setup directions but using any alternate jabber chat server instead of riseup.  Be safe!  JackBlue @jabber:    jackblue@xabber.de",
Cannabis Road 3,JackBlue,515,2014-08-16T17:31:55,** RESEARCH ** EMAIL PROVIDERS,Information Area/Tutorials,"Thanks for the appreciation.  Just from your comments here, I feel like maybe I wasn't clear on one of my major points.  You are safest if you approach email providers with the attitude that everything they say about their logging poiicies, non-cooperation with authorities, etc. are 100% lies.  Because even an email provider like riseup that says all the right things may actually be a honeypot set up by LE.  That may be very cynical, but it's how you really should think about it.  You have no way of knowing if they are telling the truth in the policies or telling you lies.  To be safe, assume they are telling you lies.  By signing up while on tor and only checking your mail through tor and encrypting every message, the FBI could be your email provider and you could still feel pretty confident in your safety.  Well maybe that's going overboard.  I wouldn't feel safe at all if the FBI was my email provider.  But the point is valid.  -It's not ""tin foil hat"" level of paranoia to question who really does control your email provider.  There really is no way to really know that and LE has done way more devious things than that to entrap people.  So if you use riseup, please don't think that makes it even a little OK to let your guard down.  Do it at your peril.  And to address your question GreyHulk, there really isn't a safe email provider.  Email as a communication medium is inherently unsafe.  It's how you sign up and use it that can offer you some level of protection.  Do not use an email account if you don't sign up for the account through Tor, and always check your mail and send mail using Tor.   And encrypt absolutely everything.  If you're using your ""secure""-ish email account, NEVER correspond with anyone that isn't doing the same.  Don't mix up recipients from your IRL insecure email and your semi-secure privacy protected email.  If yiou do you are totally compromised at that point.  If you accidentally access your email account without Tor, even just once, you should assume the email account is now 100% compromised.  Start over with a new email account.  And the person you are emaiing needs to take the same precautions.  Unfortunately, you have way of knowing if they are being safe.  Sure you can see if a message is encrypted or not, but you can't necessarily tell at a glance if they were using tor when they mailed it and you have absolutely no way of knowing if they were always safe with that mail account when they emailed other people.  So avoid email whenever you can.  And this should go without saying, but the CR message system and ""private messages"" sent through the CR forum are not secure communications in any way.  Encrypt EVERYTHING.  Please be careful everyone.  JackBlue  ","1.  What is their privacy policy2.  do the providers keep any logs3.  if they do keep logs, how easily they can be compelled to turn those over. "

All users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes numerous security issues.  Changes  Notable user-visible changes include:      Security fixes         Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox         24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).     Major new features         Spoof the network interfaces' MAC address         by default. It can be disabled in Tails Greeter.         Rework the way to         configure how Tor connects to the network         by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. This option         can be set from Tails Greeter, and replaces the old         experimental ""bridge mode"" feature.     Bugfixes         Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.         Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.         Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.         Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver. We don't need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.         Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available in Windows Camouflage mode.         Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin.     Minor improvements         Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.         Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.         Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.         Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.         Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).         Disable the autologin text consoles. This was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.         Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.         Make it possible to manually start IBus.         Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving full control over Tor to the desktop user.         Incremental upgrades improvements:             Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion.             Lock down sudo credentials a bit.             Hide debugging information.             Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports. This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.             Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.             Various user interface and phrasing improvements.         Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension.         Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange.         Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently, too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.         Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig.         Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by Debian back.         Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.         Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.         Persistent Volume Assistant:             Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.             Optimize window height.             Display device paths in a more user-friendly way.  See the online Changelog for technical details.  Known issues      Longstanding known issues.  I want to try it or to upgrade!  Go to the download page.  As no software is ever perfect, we maintain a list of problems that affects the last release of Tails.  What's coming up?  The next Tails release is scheduled for April 29.

Here is what I have done so far with setting up and using pgp -  1. Downloaded gpg4usb programme and created my key pair, Backed up copy of my private key.   2. Copied the sellers public key into notepad and saved it then imported it to gpg4usb and it now appears on the right hand side on the screen below my key.   3. I put my public key on my profile.   4. I type my message in the clipboard thing on left hand side of the programme then I click on the sellers key and hit encypt. I copy this into CR message to seller.   5. Seller replies to me and I copy and paste it into gpg4usb programmes clipboard. Hit decrypt and I am asked for my password. Enter password and bingo I can read sellers reply.   So my question is what I am doing wrong that the seller cannot contact me via his. Would it be he does not have my correct public key?  I must mention that I originally created a key pair with another pgpg programme GPG4win but I read gpg4usb easier to use so created new key pair with it. Seller had my original public key but I sent him new one and made sure correct one is on my profile.   Sorry for being a complete noob but want to make sure I get this important step right for all concerned. I've read a few noob guides and watched few video guides but my tired stressed brain is melted!   Thanks in advance to any kind souls     Respect and peace.   Gak",

Cannabis Road 3,PyroWolf,609,2014-08-15T13:27:08,BTC 'Conspiracy Theory' - Virtual Currency is NSA or CIA Project,Information Area/Security,"From International Business Times, UK edition - *CN>  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-suspected-be-nsa-cia-project-1460439   Bitcoin 'Conspiracy Theory' Alleges Virtual Currency is NSA or CIA Project  Digital currency bitcoin, which has experienced sudden growth in terms of usage and value, has been criticised by many and some have labelled it as a ponzi scheme. Given its alleged use in drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing and other anti-social activities, a number of states across the globe have warned consumers about the risks involved in relying on and using the decentralised money.  Now, a group that claims to track the activities of government organisations around the globe alleges that the popular cryptocurrency is a project run by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose reputation has been hit by the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden.  The group, named CIA Project, claims that bitcoin is made by the NSA or the CIA. However, the 'evidences' the group presents lack depth, potentially making it a conspiracy theory. CIA Project's main proof revolves around the name of bitcoin's alleged creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The group says a white paper on bitcoin was released in 2008, and it was reportedly written by a person named Satoshi Nakamoto, which roughly means ""Central Intelligence"" in Japanese.  The team added that Bitcoin Forum, a bitcoin community where Nakamoto used to communicate, usually removes posts connecting bitcoin with CIA. Raising suspicions about his identity, Nakamoto has never left even a single personal identification clue in his numerous posts on Bitcoin Forum over the years. CIA Project alleges that this shows 'intelligence training'.  In addition, Gavin Bell (aka Gavin Andresen), who is the public face of bitcoin, claims that he has been communicating with Nakamoto for many years. However, Gavin has neither met Nakamoto nor spoken with him on the phone even once. Nevertheless, the anonymity of the alleged bitcoin creator, Nakamoto, cannot be viewed a valid point to base the claim. In addition, Nakamoto is a common Japanese name, and the group's arrived translation is coincidental.  Another evidence the group is trying to bring is related to the source code of the digital currency. It says the common programme used by most cryptocurrencies to create secure keys is suspected to be back-doored by the NSA, citing a ""recent WikiLeaks document"". Bitcoin did not use the most popular programme to create secure keys, and the fact shows that the NSA already had full information about bitcoin, according to the group. ""While bitcoin believers portray bitcoin as a new decentralised currency, the command structure of bitcoin core development is 100% centralised,"" CIA Project says.  The claim could be refuted as bitcoin's source code is open source, and therefore the NSA need not put a back door in the code. The programme that bitcoin uses to secure transactions, SHA-256, is created by the NSA. The open source programme is said to be one of the most secure algorithms in the world.   <end>",

Also, Satoshi Nakomoto's alias means ?clear thinking, quick witted; wise"" in Japanese. Not exactly sure how people came to 'central intelligence.' Even if it did, would you seriously consider the CIA actually creating that kind of a connection off of an alias for all to find?      This point I agree on, more developers should definatly take up the cause. Leaving it to the 'Bitcoin Foundation' forever could be problems down the road.    Any programmer will tell you this is simply not true. I've personally worked an alternative currencies base QT wallet and it has nothing of the sort."," ""While bitcoin believers portray bitcoin as a new decentralised currency, the command structure of bitcoin core development is 100% centralised,"";It says the common programme used by most cryptocurrencies to create secure keys is suspected to be back-doored by the NSA, citing a ""recent WikiLeaks document""."

Cannabis Road 3,sydneyjames,727,2014-08-30T00:21:00,*Important* security tip for people looking to become vendors/sellers,Information Area/Security," It is fairly simple process to become a vendor on most markets but Anyone looking to do so should just take a few simple precautions before doing so.  First, if you already have an account that you've bought stuff with you should SERIOUSLY consider making a new account for selling stuff. The main reasons for this is, any orders you've made from your account in the past means that vendor may (or may not) still have your name and address from that sale.  This means if you start selling a lot of stuff on here and that other vendor who has your address gets in trouble, they may pass your info along to LE for a reduced sentence or, the original seller could already be associate with LE i  the first place.  Either way its not very safe on your part to use a existing buying account for selling.  Your best bet is to register a new account with a username and password you've never used anywhere else!  Once you have your account you need to do some serious studying on the security basic's before setting up a vending account.  ",

However, not everybody at the NSA is on board with this strategy. Tor developer Andrew Lewman says even as flaws in Tor are rooted out by the NSA and British counterpart GCHQ, other agents from the two organizations leak those flaws directly to the developers, so they can be fixed quickly. He said, ""You have to think about the type of people who would be able to do this and have the expertise and time to read Tor source code from scratch for hours, for weeks, for months, and find and elucidate these super-subtle bugs or other things that they probably don't get to see in most commercial software."" Lewman estimates the Tor Project receives these reports on a monthly basis. He also spoke about how a growing amount of users will affect Tor. He suggests a massive company like Google or Facebook will eventually have to take up the task of making Tor scale up to millions of users.",

Cannabis Road 3,TheBestCannabis,526,2014-08-01T17:59:39,What does *CLEARNET WARNING* before links mean?,Information Area/Security,"The *Clearnet* warning came about because on some older browsers/setups it would be possible to click a link in a TOR browser and have it open automatically in a clearnet browser.  The intention, at least originally, was rather to make certain people opened the link manually through TOR, and not through their clearnet browser.  Theoretically, going to clearnet links that you saw on the darknet is a way to easily get deanonymized.  If I were in law enforcement, for example, I may post a link to a law-enforcement controlled clearnet server on a vendor's discussion forum. Something like  www.fakedruginformationdomainname.com/stuff. The law enforcement could then look at all the people who accessed that very specific LEO-controlled domain and correctly ascertain that ALL of them were vendors or darknet-related IP addresses.  So to summarize: Never ever open any clearnet links you find on the darknet on your clearnet browser, KEEP IT IN TOR, where you are (at least we hope) mostly safe. ",

Cannabis Road 3,PyroWolf,800,2014-09-06T19:43:34,TorChat,Information Area/Security,"TOR CHAT   By now you should know that any type of messaging system is likely compromised or storing your data for an unknown period of time, and if you ever become a person of interest can be looked back upon for 5+ years. This means things like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, Skype Messaging, Facebook Instant/Private Message, Text Messages, and other forms of communication are all likely being monitored to some degree, at the very least logging the meta data. But you should always treat everything as if those who are monitoring it can read the content of the email as well. We have talked about communicating with PGP, we have talked about using TOR and hidden services, and we have talked about good practices of OpSec. But some of us want to be able to instant message somebody else. The good news is, you can do this with something called TorChat.  TorChat is a decentralized anonymous instant messenger that uses Tor hidden services as its underlying Network, in other words it communicates over the Tor network through the .onion URL protocol. This provides end to end encryption that we talked about in previous posts. It provides cryptographically secure text messaging and file transfers for business dealings, and confidential communication between two people. The best news, is that you can use TorChat on your Windows, Linux and your smart phones. A French developer released a version for MAC users, but it still in beta and should be used at your own risk. You can get TorChat for the iPhone in the Apple store, you can get TorChat in the Android Market as well, so you can even use it as a means of text messaging somebody else who also has TorChat.  In TorChat, every user has a unique alphanumeric ID consisting of 16 characters. This ID will be randomly created by Tor when the client is started the first time, it is basically the .onion address of a hidden service. TorChat clients communicate with each other by using Tor to contact the other?s hidden service. For example, the first time you open TorChat your computer might generate d0dj309jfj94jfgf.onion and from here on out, d0dj309jfj94jfgf will be your TorChat ID that you give out to people that you want to be able to message you.  Here is the home page of TorChat.  https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat  http://www.sourcemac.com/?page=torchat ? MAC users  Unfortunately at this time, TorChat does not run properly in Tails, so you will either need to run it on your Windows, Linux or MAC system. It is pretty straight forward, download it, unpack it and run it and everything else should happen automatically for you. Once the avatar beside your TorChat ID turns green, you are online and same with your contacts. You can add contains by right clicking and choosing Add Contact and just enter their TorChat ID.  At this time there is some people debate as to whether or not TorChat is completely safe, and I would say that TorChat is about as safe as Tor is, just make sure you practice the same good practices you are used to. Do not give out personal information, if you are sending sensitive information use PGP encryption and so forth.  Here is another article on how TorChat works going into a little bit more detail. You can access it over the onion network.  http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Hacking_TorChat ",

Cannabis Road 3,kwikeemart,368,2014-06-29T18:07:30,any examples of them busting darknet weed vendors?,Information Area/Security, In Canada it is a Schedule 3 drug and even larger busts usually end up in time spent community service and fine for first time offenders. We have a long time customer that claims he orders 2lbs from USA it got seized at customs and he never received a seizure letter or got raided. He said the tracking number stayed active for 6+ months and it just sat in customs. LSD and mushrooms are also a schedule 3. Still to say you do not want the wrong border gaurd to pick up your product or RCMP detective to be on your case as legally it is still punishable as time in jail.  Remember its illegal to j walk its done millions of times a day due to the belief it is not punishable. It sucks when you are the one who gets a cop who is slightly overzealous and hands out a ticket for it. Dealing or trafficking any substance is illegal and though what you offer may be deemed not bad all it takes is a detective who despises what you do and it can get you time in a federal prison. Stay safe and just treat your operation like you will be busted if you do not do everything in your power to avoid capture.  Slow methodical decisions to keep your freedom is needed and I hope we all stay safe.

Cannabis Road 3,Crypto,368,2014-06-26T21:28:35,any examples of them busting darknet weed vendors?,Information Area/Security," I agree that a cannabis vendor will be a lesser priority for LE than shall not be named, meth, shall not be named, fraud, child porn, boom boom sticks, etc.   However, let's remember PlutoPete from Silk Road who sold moisture barrier bags..... nothing he sold was illegal and he was still raided by LE and had all his computers seized and he had to shell out thousands of dollars in legal fees to get his equipment back.  My point is; If you slip up, even once, it's going to come back and bite you in the ass, whether you are high priority or low priority.    EDIT: Also, I believe there has been one cannabis vendor from the original Silk Road that was busted, but he was apparently moving a lot of product. Pounds/Kilos at a time.  But at the end of the day, never get  comfortable doing what you're doing. Never let your guard down.","the assumption (a perhaps dangerous assumption) is that weed vendors will be less priority for LE than shall not be named, pills, etc. There have been plenty of examples of LE taking down non-weed vendors.

Cannabis Road 3,kwikeemart,378,2014-06-28T07:49:07,Canadian Postage Unmarked stamps...,Information Area/Security, Not sure what information is in the stamp but maybe try to verify if it was voided in Canada or maybe in your customs. It is also quite possible they had a shipping error and was intended to return to sender but had to manually sort the package. I know the far majority of packages in Canada are automatically sorted and are viewed from a distance when leaving the country. So maybe if it has a hand written address or too small of font it went to manual sorting and may have been stamped their.  On a side note I have never heard of packages being profiled with a voided stamps stamp. There is definitely a good explanation for it and it is not you are under investigation. They would of seized the package or done a controlled delivery they would not have profiled it and then decided to give it to you hassle free. I would not think to much about it as it does not sound very serious and nothing seems to far out of the ordinary.,"Hmmm.So actually I should be worried about the one that WAS VOIDED then maybe...Thanks for the information!And so I shouldn't resell on ebay the unused canadian stamps then But had I ever went to canada I would have probably reused the stamps there.In my country, if the stamp wasn't voided it's the postmans fault and you could reuse the stamp without any further problem.

Cannabis Road 3,pothead,473,2014-07-18T13:25:50,Tutorial on how to install Tails onto a USB drive,Information Area/Security,"Greetings fellow potheads Here is a good read  Tutorial On How to install Tails onto a USB drive.  Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.  Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked.  Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis.""  You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.  1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html  1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -  https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key  2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/  3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer     3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer     3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)     3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)     3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)     3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least.  4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  Booting from a USB drive: ------------------------------------- If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue.  Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). (Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version)  http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/  For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read  http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm  If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/  I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...  https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin  Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional.  7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.      7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""           7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)           7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.       8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.  9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)      9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!""           9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.           9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.       10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.       11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).       Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)  If you have any relevant information pertaining to this topic, feel free to update and improve upon it. This was a response in the original thread (by Meatgrinder) that I feel is worth posting, using the dvd/usb method as an alternative to the 2 usb method of installing Tails.  I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1.  I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted.  Booted into tails, hit Applications' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer' then clone and install (as directed above)  It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader.  Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to ""Applications -> Tails -> Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it.   Installing tails via VM:  If you don't have a DVD drive or burner or DVD's to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine. It would go something like this: 1) Download latest tails iso from:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file 3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso 4) Insert a USB flash drive 5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead 6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer 7) Click ""Clone & Install""   Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written 9) Click ""Create Live USB"" 10) Click ""Next"" 11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK""  That's it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USB  ***Disclaimer I found this on pandoras forum***   ",

The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis.""  You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.   *** Update: Meatgrinder has posted steps on how to install Tails to a DVD first, then onto a USB from there. Thanks! *** *** Update #2: Vegeta has offered a way to install Tails to USB with the use of a virtual machine. Thanks! *** *** If any of the links do not work, please PM me and I will update them for you! *** *** All of the following links can and should be downloaded through the Tor network! ***  1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html  1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -  https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key  2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/  3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer     3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer     3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)     3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)     3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)     3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least.  4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  **** (Steps continue in the next post!) ****   Booting from a USB drive: ------------------------------------- If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue.  Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). (Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version)  http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/  For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read  http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm  If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/  I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...  https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en  https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin  Next up: Installing a Persistent Volume alongside a LiveUSB copy of Tails (this is why you need TWO USB drives)       Re: Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full Tutorial ? Reply #1 on: October 08, 2013, 05:11:13 pm ? Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You may want to print this text out on paper for easier reference.    *** (Continued from first post!) ***   5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional.   7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.       7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""           7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)           7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.       8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required.   9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)       9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!"" characters    )           9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.           9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.       10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.       11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).       Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)   Re: Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full Tutorial ? Reply #2 on: October 08, 2013, 05:16:28 pm ? If you have any relevant information pertaining to this topic, feel free to update and improve upon it. This was a response in the original thread (by Meatgrinder) that I feel is worth posting, using the dvd/usb method as an alternative to the 2 usb method of installing Tails.  I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1.  I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted.  Booted into tails, hit Applications' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer' then clone and install (as directed above)  It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader.  Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to ""Applications -> Tails -> Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it  Re: Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full Tutorial ? Reply #3 on: October 08, 2013, 05:18:18 pm ? Original thread response by Vegeta, installing tails via VM:  If you don't have a DVD drive or burner or DVD's to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine. It would go something like this: 1) Download latest tails iso from:  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file 3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso 4) Insert a USB flash drive 5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead 6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer 7) Click ""Clone & Install""   Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written 9) Click ""Create Live USB"" 10) Click ""Next"" 11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK""  That's it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USB If you want to configure a persistent volume on a virtual machine, that's also possible! Though I doubt anyone wants to do it once they have the bootable USB with tails on it. If there's any interest, I can post how to do that as well. It's a bit more involved ",
Cannabis Road 3,PyroWolf,619,2014-08-19T07:40:43,Ethereum: Making the Entire World Trustless,Information Area/Legal,"From  DDW <--*clearnet*  Huuuge text wall, but interesting bathroom reading  /PW     Ethereum: Making the Entire World Trustless (Part 1 ? Introduction)  POSTED BY: EVAN FAGGART       AUGUST 18, 2014       We all know about the radical potential that Bitcoin has to make the world?s monetary system trustless. Bitcoin is already, in itself, completely trustless. There is no central authority that governs over the issuance of Bitcoin or the regulation of its supply. It is scarce; bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air, unlike the fiat currencies we are currently forced by law to use. Even transactions with Bitcoin are trustless. Once a payment is sent, it cannot be retrieved in any way. Therefore, it cannot be double spent. The transaction is confirmed by randomly chosen miners in a matter of minutes. There is no middle man, no bank or credit card company, that you have to put your faith in. The topic of Bitcoin?s impact on the structure and operation of government has been widely discussed in the Bitcoin community. The main source of government power is its monopoly on money. With the sole authority to issue money create arbitrarily and infinitely, governments can pay for anything they want. They can wage endless wars over politics and natural resources, or they can fund massive welfare states to keep the citizens complacent and subservient. Bitcoin can change all that. By decentralizing the money supply, governments lose their monopoly control over it. Furthermore, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult to track, essentially rendering the government?s power of compulsory taxation moot. Consequently, governments would rely on voluntary donations to continue operations, meaning that they actually have to provide value to society. This change in the operation of governments would make them completely voluntary, which many argue would make them completely obsolete. But Bitcoin cannot fully decentralize all aspects of society, however. Even if it can render violent governments impotent, Bitcoin does not do very much in terms of creating decentralized social structures outside of the realm of money. Here is where Ethereum will fill the gap. Ethereum is not a crypto-currency, it is not even a monetary system. It isn?t a website, or any kind of social network. Ethereum is a platform. That is all Ethereum is. It is a platform based on smart contracts that allow for the funding and implementation of any type of project. The only limitations are those limits on the imaginations of the people using Ethereum. Simply put, Ethereum is a decentralized development platform that provides a trustless system of contracts and project implementation. This distributed development platform operates on Ether, the built in unit of payment in the Ethereum network. The Ethers could, of course, end up being a currency. However, the potentialities of Ethereum are so grand that the Ether will likely serve as a means of digitally signing contracts and verifying escrow transactions that release other currencies, like Bitcoin, into the possession of the person who has completed the contracted job. The main building block of Ethereum is the smart contract, which is a decentralized, trustless contract that exists within the Ethereum network. They are verified by using Ethers to confirm transactions and are limited only by what the developers using this platform can imagine, as was mentioned before. And the things that have so far been imagined are simply stunning! Here is a list of a few things that are possible within the Ethereum network that are listed on the platform?s official website: ?Create a currency and issue shares.? ?Contracts, law, and escrow.? ?Financial instruments and derivatives.? ?Decentralized organizations (DAOs).? ?Decentralized voting.? ?Decentralized data storage.? These are only a few basic things that are listed on Ethereum?s website. The possibilities are literally endless. The concept is so simple yet elegant; a decentralized system of contracts that can be used to create anything that is desired. However, the development process is extremely complex. This project is the cutting edge of decentralization technology, far outweighing that of the various crypto-currencies, despite their constant growth and improvement. It is essentially impossible to cover all of the things that can be done on Ethereum, because literally anything that is contract-based can be done. So let us imagine what the operation of a city would look like on the Ethereum network. Imagine that a neighborhood or city has a social contract outlined in a digital format on Ethereum. The contract would guarantee things that normal governments provide today, such as water and electricity. However, this social contract would be completely voluntary, there would be no forced taxation of violent enforcement of the rules, or laws?if they could be called laws under this system. An individual moving into the area would consent to this social contract by sending an Ether to an address that is owned by a company or agency responsible for supplying and maintaining the utility in question, whether it be water, power, sewer, telephone, etc. This transaction would set another transaction in motion, in which the person who has newly confirmed his or her consent to the social contract puts the necessary payment into an escrow service, which would of course operate on Ethereum. The company would then turn on the water, power, etc. in this person?s house. Once the utility has been turned on, the person confirms the transaction by approving the release of his funds from the escrow account. The process repeats in the next payment cycle. If the utility company turns on the power but the resident does not release the money from escrow, the company simply turns the power off. There is no force involved, everyone is responsible for their actions. Failure to comply with the explicitly agreed upon contract results in a revocation of the services provided under the contract. This scenario seems like a much more peaceful method of conducting society indeed! Ethereum is still in the development stages at this point, so there are no empirical facts currently available about the efficacy of this system. So all we can do is speculate and theorize, which is what we have been doing above. However, if Ethereum is successfully implemented, the situation described in the previous paragraph could indeed become a reality, along with an infinite set of other social and economic organizations. If it can be imagined, and built based on a system of decentralized contracts?which everything can be, theoretically?then it can be done on Ethereum. The second part will discuss in potentials, Btc-Etherum and implementations.",

Cannabis Road 3,Saul Goodman,6,2014-02-26T03:42:51,Money Laundering and You- an Introduction,Information Area/Legal,"What is money laundering? ========================== Simply speaking, money laundering is the process by which 'dirty' money is turned into 'clean' money. In simpler terms it is turning money which might be risky to spend into money that you can spend with little to no legal risk.  NB: Simply tumbling your BTC does not constitute laundering as it does not provide you with a reasonable explanation regarding the origins of the funds.  When looking at complex systems it is useful to break them down into their component parts. In the case of money laundering we can break it down into three steps;      * Placement - Where the funds are transformed into something we can easily manipulate.     * Layering - Where the funds are manipulated in such a way that it is difficult, or impossible, to determine their origins.     * Integration - Where the funds are integrated back into a income stream looking like legitimate income.  Let's look at each of these steps more in depth.  Placement =========== Whether we are starting with cold hard cash or some other kind of funds, we need to transform this into something which we can manipulate in the way of our choosing. Traditionally this meant getting cash into the banking system. In modern times this can mean transforming the funds into digital currencies such as Bitcoin or a derivative thereof.  Layering =========== Once money is in a form that we can manipulate we will then have to manipulate them in a way such that their origins are obscured. This traditionally meant international bank transfers through countries with strong bank secrecy laws. With digital currencies this step does not need to involve banks and can be done quicker.  Integration ============ Now that the origins of the funds have been obscured they need to be integrated back into your life in a way that masks them as legitimate income. Traditionally this meant owning a cash intensive business, and slowly infiltrating the money into the legitimate cash stream by making fake sales. It should be noted that this particular method includes all three steps in one (It does however rely upon you owning and operating a profitable, or close-to, cash heavy business).  Why do we want to launder the money we have? ============================================= Funds gained through illicit means can not easily be used to purchase the more substantial assets one might need in life (e.g. real estate, cars, investments, etc.), this is where money laundering comes in. The end-result of properly laundered money is a legal income stream that you can declare to the government and pay taxes on. The latter part being the most important one. Remember; they got Al Capone on Tax Evasion.  The reason for making it an income stream is a matter of camouflage. You want to blend in to the masses, and not raise any suspicion. Think of how most people acquire and use money these days: They are paid a salary for a job and pay for any expenses with a credit-/debit card and/or with a national bank account.  Anonymous debit cards from offshore banks are only good for paying for operational expenses related to your illicit activity, they should not be your only source of funds as it does not offer an explanation regarding the source of the aforementioned funds.  Always remember that money laundering is all about camouflaging yourself financially to avoid suspicion and to 'throw of the scent'. It should be part of a larger OPSEC regiment, but that topic is beyond the scope of this introduction. ",

This can potentially identify you directly or be used collectively with other information from ISPs, online wallets, web providers, etc.  A few notable pieces of data that may compromise your privacy could be:-wallet/client's IP address is recorded in the transaction.-your wallet address.  all previous transactions to and from that address will be around forever.a little analogy for mixing (laundering) your money.Remember in elementary/primary school how the teacher would arrange all students in a circle?  Remember the 'game' where the teacher would begin by whispering a message to 1 student, then that student would tell the person to the left, then each student would relay the message to the student to the left.  Eventually the message would make the full 360 and be back to the teacher.  The story may retain the general information for the first few iterations.  By the time the message has made it around the circle it is probably damn near indecipherable.This is pretty much what coin mixing services are doing to your transaction log.  The further away you get from the origination point the more noise that will be within the blockchain.mixing coins places distance between you and your vendor."

The impression is that attackers were apparently not LE, govt, or malicious; so maybe not time to crap pants...yet.   Just a reminder to keep your head on a swivel, and stay frosty out there troops!  Clearnet *www.theverge.com/2014/7/30/5951479/tor-says-unknown-attackers-compromised-hidden-services  <snip:  The Tor encryption service is a high-profile bastion of computer security, but the project appears to have been compromised earlier this year. Today, the Tor Project blog announced that an unknown party likely managed to gather information about people who were looking up hidden services ? websites that users can operate and visit anonymously, like Silk Road ? and could theoretically have compromised other parts of the network.   Anyone who used Tor between early February and July 4th of 2014 ""should assume they were affected"" by the attack, says the Tor team. But they don't know what exactly that means. The attackers specifically looked for who was retrieving the public keys to hidden services, but they ""likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up),"" says the blog post. ""The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service."" It's possible, but less likely, that they also attempted to identify users who were just browsing the ordinary web through Tor.   >edit: also reported on DeepDotWeb, front page.edit2: corrected erroneous tech detail (see quoted)",

Cannabis Road 3,TheBestCannabis,525,2014-08-01T17:56:03,Tor Service Compromised By Unknown Attackers ,Information Area/Security,"  The *Clearnet* warning came about because on some older browsers/setups it would be possible to click a link in a TOR browser and have it open automatically in a clearnet browser.   The intention, at least originally, was rather to make certain people opened the link manually through TOR, and not through their clearnet browser.  Theoretically, going to clearnet links that you saw on the darknet is a way to easily get deanonymized.  If I were in law enforcement, for example, I may post a link to a law-enforcement controlled clearnet server on a vendor's discussion forum. Something like  www.fakedruginformationdomainname.com/stuff. The law enforcement could then look at all the people who accessed that very specific LEO-controlled domain and correctly ascertain that ALL of them were vendors or darknet-related IP addresses.   So to summarize: you've got it backwards Pyro! Never ever open any clearnet links you find on the darknet on your clearnet browser, keep it IN TOR, where you are (at least we hope) mostly safe.      Regarding the article, I think this one is primarily directed at hidden service operators, who should probably have a bit of sweaty palm syndrome going on reading that I'm sure. It would take a crazy amount of effort to try to deanonymize a single random tor user in the hope they are someone 'important,' one has to imagine the vast majority of the deanonymization efforts are targeted at the big fish.

DarkBay Forums,hopenchange,23,2014-02-08T20:04:10,P.G.P ugh,Off Topic/Security,hey  PGP/GPG isn't too difficult once you get your head around what is happening.  Basically you have to generate a private/public key pair.  When you do use at the very minimum 2048 bit key but you really should use larger keys.  4096 would be good.  The idea is that you give other people your public key so that they can encrypt a message.  Once they encrypt the message with your public key they send the encrypted message to you.  You hold the private key to the pair and with that you can decrypt the message.  Always keep the private key safe and NEVER give to anyone.  Some links to help you get the idea are below.  I have used tails before but I don't remember if GPG is built in.  It should be if it isn't.  If you do use windows you will want to go here   http://www.gpg4win.org/  Some sites for referencing commands and such.  If I have time I will try to do a proper write up with command examples and such and will sticky it.  There are many other forums on the darknet with the same info as well.     http://www.queen.clara.net/pgp/art3.html   http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/id/gpg-howto.shtml   http://zacharyvoase.com/2009/08/20/openpgp/   http://code.seanodonnell.com/?id=8  ,

DarkBay Forums,LostTemple,42,2014-02-17T04:50:20,General Safety Advice,Off Topic/Security,"There are some general rules for staying safe. They are not covered in detail and I encourage you read more about security and safety.   Disable JavaScript   YOU MUST DISABLE JAVASCRIPT! We are not exaggerating when we ask that you disable JavaScript. There are currently no known exploits, but there have previously been exploits which have revealed the identity of users who had JavaScript enabled. If you are using our site you must disable JavaScript otherwise you are exposing yourself to an incredible risk. Never trust any dark net site that forces you to enable JavaScript. We don't recommend using any clearnet sites through the Tor Browser with JavaScript enabled. Stay safe, disable JavaScript.   Disable iFrames  iFrames can be dangerous for many reasons. This is not desperately important but it is good practice to disables iFrames where possible. They are not needed and pose security concerns.   Passwords  Unfortunately there are some people who use very weak passwords. It is extremely bad practice to use a password as common as this. Even though there is a Captcha robot check on DarkBay there may be some bruteforcers that can bypass the Captcha. If you are going to buy or sell using our service please choose a complicated password. We recommend storing your passwords inside a text document and encrypted with your own PGP key.   Posting Times  Be careful when you make posts on the forums or perform actions on the site. If there is a trend, and people can observe that, you may find your identity dangerously close to being exposed. If you post on the forums concurrently from the hours of 4pm - 10pm EST then anyone who watches and correlates your posts can determine your timezone and possible location. If you are not using a VPN this is extremely dangerous. From this they can observe any Tor traffic in that region and then, with enough posts, correlate your exact location. If you are posting between 4pm - 10pm EST then that also indicates you are a student. Students generally finish school at 4pm and sleep around 10pm. If you are not posting around 6pm, they can assume you are having food and this gives them even more evidence about your timezone. To prevent this from happening we recommend using a VPN to reduce the risks.   Your writing style  Do you ever post on the clearnet? Maybe on Facebook or Twitter? Do you use forums on the clearnet? Make sure that every post you make is very different to the posts that you make on the clearnet websites. I would recommend not making posts on the clearnet at all or sparingly. You should expect that any observing persons have very complicated algorithms for searching the clearnet and correlating posts made there with posts you made here. They have access to Google and all the other search engines, so additionally do not search for anything incriminating. If you post on these forums about searching for DMT, do not then search on Google for DMT. If you need to use a search engine then you StartPage or DuckDuckGo. I strongly recommend going back to any clearnet posts you made and deleting or removing that information where possible. If you are intending to use the dark net regularly, delete your social network profiles, delete your Twitter posts and destroy anything about your life that exists on the clearnet.",

DarknetHeroes Forums,MoonSugar,62,2015-06-09T23:25:00,"A guide to XMPP, Off-the-Record, and basic chat client configuration with Tor",General Boards/Security & Anonymity,"Hi, I wanted to write a guide for the community to introduce some of the clients and Jabber (XMPP) server options, and explain exactly: what is XMPP? what is Off the Record? And how do I use these to enable private, end-to-end encrypted, man-in-the-middle-proofed conversations with authentication and forward secrecy?  Why do I write this guide? Because if I see another rehash of torchat using the same fundamentally flawed ""announce your chat presence as a tor hidden service!!"" approach I'm going to wring the neck of the developer who pushed that drivel to Git. Ahem, moving on...   What is XMPP? First, let's briefly discuss exactly what XMPP is. It's a instant messaging protocol, just like AIM or Yahoo, except it's designed to be general-purpose and extensible. It is widely adopted today - it used to be the basis for Facebook's chat system, it still is the basis for Google's chat service, and there are hundreds of other servers out there which offer XMPP accounts, oftentimes to anybody who simply connects to the server wishing to register.  Why is this approach better than, say, torchat? Well, for one, there are XMPP services aplenty out there which actually offer XMPP hidden services. This is vastly superior to torchat, which effectively configures your host/Tor configuration to behave as a mini hidden service. As if we haven't seen recently how exploitable hidden services are to denial of service attacks, etc... I don't think I need to elaborate on why this is a Fundamentally Bad Idea.   Off-the-Record? It's a library developed (separate project totally from XMPP) by cypherpunks.de, and is used not just for XMPP but with other protocols and clients too. With XMPP it extends the capabilitie to allow one to have one-on-one instant message conversations which are private, end-to-end encrypted, cannot be man-in-the-middled by the chat service provider (unlike Skype, for example, which is ""end-to-end encrypted"" but the service provider - Microsoft - can use their own key to decrypt ANY Skype conversation), and provides forward secrecy, meaning conversations are theoretically immune to being captured/logged and then decrypted at some time in the future.  OTR also provides the means of authenticating others (using one of several options - manual verification, question & answer, etc.) Each user is identified by a ""fingerprint"", and the first time you talk to someone using OTR, the conversation status starts as ""Unverified."" You must decide how to verify the user - is it someone who can prove their identity to you by, say, a signed GPG message with their fingerprint, because you know their key? Or is it your first time meeting somebody? That's a call that you have to make. Should a verified buddy suddenly pop up in a conversation as ""Unverified,"" it is worth investigating to see what changed and if you are extremely security conscious, make them re-authenticate their new fingerprint!   Choosing a client OK, now you're wondering, neat! Where do I sign up? First you've got to decide what client you're going to use for XMPP+OTR, though. While this is in no way specific to XMPP, the EFF does have a useful Chat Client Scorecard page which ranks different clients by a number of important metrics.  Some noteworthy mentions in our case of XMPP: Pidgin+OTR (large attack surface, but works fine on Windows); ChatSecure+Orbot on Android (all-around the best Android XMPP+OTR client I've seen); and... well, that's it for mentions on that page. But there are many other XMPP clients out there. Psi is a good all-around XMPP cllient, but I've yet to find a patch that's still available for download which adds OTR support (if anyone finds one, do share!) mcabber or the still-in-development Jackline are good terminal options for Linux users. There are others I'm sure, but those are the ones that come to mind first as the easiest and best options.  Note that Psi and Pidgin (and ChatSecure I think) all have the ability to register an account on the server you're connecting to, if the server allows such registrations. I'm not sure about mcabber or jackline. This is really convenient and is generally the preferred method of registering an XMPP account on most servers, except private servers.

Looking back now it's not hard to see he didn't have much of a support team that's why the market suffered so much. Missing so many features.

Also the method does not require you to know how to card, there are other ways. Also I back my method 100%. Once you become a customer of mine, I will make sure to support you until the method lands cash in your pocket.  I dare anyone else to offer that for just a ""benny."" I have had both evo noobs (4 forum post, and first evo market purchase ) to veterans with over 5 BTC in purchases grab my method, and every single one of them have been pleased. Combining my method and my customer service focus will leave you pleased, and with more money in your pocket than you invested. Guaranteed.

It's perked up my day to see so many people able to cash out on SBUX. Method is still great and strong, let me know if you have any questions! EDIT: I have been getting a lot of PM's asking if my method will make $X in Y days. Look guys, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme, or even a get-rich-eventually scheme. My guide will not turn you into a millionaire. What my guide WILL do is put some extra money in your pockets for very little effort on your part. You should set realistic goals for yourself, and with real effort, you will make real extra money. Nothing happens overnight, but if you stick to this method, and hire some help after you get very comfortable with the process, you stand to make an extra 10-15k a month. I will be here to answer all of your questions, no matter how stupid you think they may be, but please do not ask me if my guide will make you money. Because I don't know. I don't know if you will actually follow the method 100% or will be disappointed when your bank account doesn't have 5 extra zeroes next week. The price will not be lowered or raised, and it will continue to make everyone as happy as the Coffee King himself. Just please be realistic   After many revisions and feedback from other users, I am delighted to announce that my method is now published and available for purchase. This method is 100% noob-friendly, and will teach you a no-risk and legal method to get money out of Starbucks gift cards. The guide also teaches you how to properly card their website for eGifts, which of course is NOT legal or risk-free.  Let's teach this S-Corp that they can't keep charging 3 dollars for a simple coffee and not give back some of those profits to us! http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/70842

Literally anyone can do this anywhere in the world, as long as there are a few Starbucks around!The method laid out is dead simple, but effective. My first thought when I read the guide was âAre you kidding me? Thatâs it?â However, I soon realized that I couldnât get pissed over simplicity. Some of the best money makers are simple (ever hear of KISS? As in Keep it Simple, Stupid). Complicated doesnât always = $$$.Before I read this guide, I was already aware of Cryptothrift and the huge amount of cheap SBUX cards sold there (my pantry and freezer is full of coffee lol). The cards do get cancelled/zeroed out quickly sometimes, but if you follow the guide, youâll learn how to easily clean these crappy cards and make some major cash. Iâve negotiated $100 SBUX cards for just $5 each on Cryptothrift before, no need to spend $20-$50 on these if you know you can move quick enough.So how much can you make? Like anything, it depends on what you put into it. If you work alone and have a decent amount of SBUX where you live, I believe you could pull in $500 a week (for a few hours of work), much more if you get a team together. If you think up a few twists to the method like I have, expect to make much more Thanks for writing this guide, Z0l4f. This a great method for ânoobsâ to get their feet wet in what I would consider âlite fraudâ. I also appreciate how well the guide is written. I canât tell you how many times I receive $100+ âguidesâ that are text files and the vendor couldnât be bothered to spell check his work. This was actually fun to read.I received a vouch copy, but I would have been happy with this if I paid for it.Recommended.Product Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/70842Cheers,Nancy"

I must say, before this, every guide I ever bought from Evo was a disappointment. Not this, this guide is worth every penny. As someone who rarely goes to Starbucks, I never even considered Starbucks as an option before this, but now, it makes perfect sense. It's a genius solution, plus there are plenty of twists you can put onto it with a little creativity. If you want a simple, fairly low-risk cashout method, this is it.",

No, this method will teach you how to obtain dirty Starbucks gift cards, clean them, and make a large profit off of them.  This method will only be saturated if Starbucks stops accepting credit cards for eGifts (highly unlikely), and even then, we will find a way.  By yourself, with no team included, you stand to make about 1k a week once you get used to the method. My team is down to about 3 people, and they run about $750 - 1.5k each week in clean cards. That's with maybe 5 hours of work per week as well.",

Just message them until you find one that will work with escrow. The vendors know their cards die quickly. Find someone who will willingly follow the rules, and then go with them. Once you have your cards spend them in a couple of hours, this way your investment is secured, you can release escrow quickly, and the vendor will trust you. The idea is to build up a reputation to the point where you can buy bulk carded SBUX without paying first. Mostly done over skype or icq.",chacomoli wrote:Are any of the vendors on cryptothrift legit?

Evolution Forums,nancybotwin,38938,2015-01-11T16:29:42,Re: From Coffee Beans To Crisp Greens - Transfer Service is Live!,Guides Vendors,"From Coffee to Cash â My Review.  For those of you who are jumping from guide to guide and wasting money trying to figure out how to make a good income, this is for you. Literally anyone can do this anywhere in the world, as long as there are a few Starbucks around!The method laid out is dead simple, but effective. My first thought when I read the guide was âAre you kidding me? Thatâs it?â However, I soon realized that I couldnât get pissed over simplicity. Some of the best money makers are simple (ever hear of KISS? As in Keep it Simple, Stupid). Complicated doesnât always = $$$. Before I read this guide, I was already aware of Cryptothrift and the huge amount of cheap SBUX cards sold there (my pantry and freezer is full of coffee lol). The cards do get cancelled/zeroed out quickly sometimes, but if you follow the guide, youâll learn how to easily clean these crappy cards and make some major cash. Iâve negotiated $100 SBUX cards for just $5 each on Cryptothrift before, no need to spend $20-$50 on these if you know you can move quick enough. So how much can you make? Like anything, it depends on what you put into it. If you work alone and have a decent amount of SBUX where you live, I believe you could pull in $500 a week (for a few hours of work), much more if you get a team together. If you think up a few twists to the method like I have, expect to make much more  Thanks for writing this guide, Z0l4f. This a great method for ânoobsâ to get their feet wet in what I would consider âlite fraudâ. I also appreciate how well the guide is written. I canât tell you how many times I receive $100+ âguidesâ that are text files and the vendor couldnât be bothered to spell check his work. This was actually fun to read. I received a vouch copy, but I would have been happy with this if I paid for it. Recommended. Product Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/70842 Cheers, Nancy",

I am working with a couple of carders on this. The issue we think is that SBUX has actually caught on to VPN's and vip72 shitsocks.  If you are going to card SBUX I recommend non-avs visa bins. I also recommend hitting each card for 25 dollars at first.,gessej wrote:so is the method going to be fixed since you said you were having troubles?

I felt touched by a magic wand !! I felt as if God I'd pour a gift !! Maybe that probe ever! however .. I imagine cocaine hydrochloride (inhaled) would be equal or better and pass is based hydrochloride, looked unspoilable .. I tried it .. the first line and did some more feel very alert, but nothing that do with the base cocaine mouth .. nothing to see! after a few lines saturated with very bad mood over, and just wanted to take more and more but in the end I felt worse and worse .... and is as pure as it can get, but via inhalation is complete Error! complete mistake !! finding !! if you will do this process and want to really enjoy the best stuff of the world, try cocaine base fully oxidized pure mouth. simply deposit in the mouth and drink water .. is something incredible, perfect, great, better than probe ever! as comment, formerly when cocaine was legal and was sold without a prescription, it was taken in pill form and spoke wonders of it! I now understand why!every one that takes whatever, I just want my experience can serve you for something you enjoy amazing, for me the best stuff of the world !!indeed, the oxidized and pure base taken orally is the best thing ever !! probe It is pure perfection! nothing beats it! hope someone experience and leave your comment  if someone looks stupid or think I exaggerate, first try it !!

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-02-19T23:51:24,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Nope, this is a common misconception. This method has been designed with accuracy in mind on a small scale. It has been optimised so 900g of coca leaf,  (which is really not that much) can be processed on a micro scale similar to how it's done in the jungle labs of South America, to produce around 3.5g of 99.9% pure cocaine.  Alot of time and research went into working all this out.  The procedure is very easy to perform and doesn't take a lot of time. Someone with no chemistry experience can perform this with out problem following the information I provide.  Think about it. Cocaine is produced in jungles, by people living and working in poverty. With our superior western equipment and easy access to chemicals its much easier faster, efficient and cleaner than anything produced in columbia bolivia, peru, etc and shipped around the globe...  Give it a try, it's alot of fun.

With this guide I am offering private tuition to help you through it. You will only need perform it once or twice to understand and be able do it without much thought or effort. It's quite straight forward. There are 3 simple stages. Chemicals are basic and available at most hardware stores.  I used to perform this regularly. But i don't have my own space to do this as easily any more. I enjoy teaching this to people who are interested, so I thought I'd share it in here. As it involves my own time with private tuition, I feel charging a small fee is fair. After all, Reading the guide and doing just one small 900g batch will make you full initial investment back and a bit more",finesser wrote:also!! i sincerely doubt the average asshole who isnt at least somewhat proficient in using chemicals and labs or whatever the fuck can truly truly produce 100% pure cokei also doubt that anyone who can truly produce their own 100% pure coke would let other ppl know how to do it and wouldnt just sell it and become a billionaire in like 3 minutesbut i'm willing to bet im wrong
Evolution Forums,finesser,206,2014-02-20T00:23:44,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"quick question because i know ppl who sell coke so the logistics of this are making my head spin ok so ur claiming that enough leaf (.99kg) to make an 8ball (3.5g) is around 80 pounds or around 133$ USD so if my math is right, thats actually 37 and some change thousand for a whole brick of 100% coke??? it seems ridiculous to me that such a thing would be possible however i will most definitely order your guide out of morbid curiosity and the fact that i will actually slit my wrists if your guide is actually feasible and i didnt get in on it",
Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-02-20T00:37:13,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"It works out even cheaper than that to make a commercial grade brick of flake cocaine. 100% pure would work out about Â£20,000 ~ As I said, it's never one hundred percent pure when it leaves columbia and other production countries. So pure over here is nnever actually pure as such gram for gram. So add some extra profit on for the 5-10% or more cut/impurities you will find in street grade 1kg bricks of flake that you can effectively add to you high grade very pure brick of cocaine.  The thing is, to produce a kilo of cocaine this way in any short amount of time, regularly is not really feasible. The amount of coca imported would surely raise eyebrows, even how it's disguised. I wouldn't want to risk it. There is a way of doing it, as I have mentioned before, but it involves about a year of ordering the coca slowly to be safe, and then a big operation of processing that would take easily a week or more.  It would be a good long term investment but carries too much risk to be worth while for the average person.  I would never have the time or space to process that amount.  3.5 grams is not alot of work at all. The reason why people aren't doing this so much already is I guess, they can't be arsed to sit down and learn. Those who do, benefit.  I'm making it alot lot easier for people who are interested, by offering this tutorial and private help where and when needed.  Even if you did it just once, it's a great experience and something you will feel proud of pulling off.   All the best.

But so far the information is golden. The information is clear and concise. You also get visual aids as a reference to the information which is very handy. I've always been interested in how cocaine is made and now I have the opportunity to cook some up myself. I will definitely try this out when I have the space and resources.,

You mentioned on reddit recently that coca leaves are shipped in a bag. Is the box gonna fit in a regular post box or do I have to recieve it personally? That would be a big issue since the posession of coca leaves can get you to prison, at least where I come from. Also can you pay for it with bitcoins? Cheers!",

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-02-22T13:11:54,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Hi there. The coca leaf can be sent either way. A request can be made to the supplier to send a bag as opposed to a box. No one has ever had a problem with each of the methods. Customs are not really on the lookout for this sort of thing it seems. As well, the coca leaf is not actually sent as raw leaf. ( Although It has actually been sent as raw whole leaf in the past without problem) It is cleverly disguised and relabeled as not to bring any attention.  You cant as far as I am aware, pay for the coca leaf with bitcoins.  I hope this helps. You can message me if you like, with any other queries and Ill do my best to answer in as much detail as I can.",

Evolution Forums,SniperFox,206,2014-02-23T13:16:02,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,Btw I would be reluctant to share this info too much because if the feds cotton on to this they will put a stop to importation of coca leaves and close in on small cocaine production operations. Would be a shame to see this happen.,
Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-02-23T13:53:43,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Agreed.  The thing is, this has been going on for alot longer than most would think  at least ten years now...Â  The way in which the coca is sent helps avoid any problems also. Even if it was labelled correctly, as it has been with other suppliers used in the past, it seems it's not something customs are on the look out for or to interested in. It has always arrived.  But indeed, it would be bad if this all dried up. So for this reason, I'm not planning on having this information available on the market place for too long at a time. Il take it down from time to time. I'm also trying to only teach the people I see have a strong interest in this.  Best to play it safe though, don't abuse the sources and if you are planning on ordering a large amount, order to several addresses.",

But be careful with the finely powdered version of the coca leaf. It is harder to work with than the sources provided. They are small flakes as opposed to powder, so it is easier and quicker to process. But it has been done with powdered coca.   Just to let any interested people know; there are another 4 places left for tutoring this method for the next week.  All happy customers so far.  Don't hesitate to ask any questions or quieries.

In regards to the weekly placements, This is the time I find it usually takes to get customers up to speed with everything and start them off getting what they need. The guide is very detailed and explains everything, so I don't find I get a lot of questions in relation to the information. They are more so in regards to help with sourcing the odd chemical or guidance on sorting the equipment out for the first stage.

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-01-16T00:51:02,"[Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Hello everyone.  I am cocainecowboy, an experienced cocaine cook. I will teach you how to make your own cocaine like a true professional at home. Experience the real deal. I will tutor you to success, you will be making cocaine like they do in the huge jungles Colombia,  Bolivia and other production counties, but with a more refined, easier, cleaner and cheaper technique. A lot of research and development, practical testing and maths went into this work and it took a few years and a collaborated effort from friends around the world. Now I have wrote everything down in a step by step way for anyone to follow and produce their own pure cocaine in very good yields. Remember, those people in the jungles of the major production counties are just normal people. Often you will find young children in the cocaine processing labs working and making cocaine with the others. They have very little money, tools, equipment or even food, also poor quality living conditions. Yet, they manage to produce this amazing product. We will make it even better though... Let me explain; I have decided to put up for sale at the evolution market place a very in depth and easy to follow guide that I have personally wrote, containing information and step by step  instructions I know and have used extensively for many years, to extract and produce your own high quality pure cocaine at home quite cheaply at 99%+ purity. It's some mind-blowing product. The process is easy to learn and complete and I'm also offering my own personal assistance to anyone who purchases and wishes to give it a go. I have alot of great feedback so take a look! Over 300 very happy customers. It's a great experience. You can also make cocaine freebase straight from the leaf ready to smoke with this method with just a few simple steps, producing those amazing big loud bell ringers every time..  I have had this knowledge for a while now but had stopped using it due to the fact I got very used to performing this procedure and enjoying the product quite often. In the end I gave up producing and packed cocaine altogether. My living situation changed and my lifestyle, and I didn't have to freedom to do this any longer like I used to.  Im now in a position where this information sold on would help me out, so I have spent time writing the guide and I am offering a unique service of responsive private help or walk through assistance where requested to all who purchase my guide. I will use a variety of platforms for support. I offer pgp encryption for privacy If you wish also. My key can be found below this message and in my profile at the market place on evolution. Please feel free to send messages in plain text also.  I will be offering a customer service to help people through the procedure who have any problems or wish for me to explain anything further. I will be available for most hours of the day, every day for support. I have set the guide out in a way that anyone can follow it and achieve a product in good yield at the end though, so not much assistance should be needed but I am here to answer anything customers would like to ask. You won't need any chemistry knowledge or experience of anything like this. Everything is well described and set out easy to follow.  I have had over 300 customers so far and every single one is very happy with their purchase and impressed with the information I have provided and also the support and help I give to my customers after sale. I answer many questions to people who are also interested in buying the guide, so don't hesitate to ask anything your curious about. I'm online alot so il respond quite quickly Please have a look at my profile on evolution marketplace where the guide is for sale. I have a lot of great feedback. You can message me there aswell.  The overall outlay is quite low (under Â£180 for everything including the guide) and can be easily recovered on the first run, which can be completed in a matter of hours if you wish. I recommend spending a good afternoon on it though and taking your time first time round. After your first run you'll find you can complete it quicker. You'll have a good idea and feel of the process by then. It's quick to learn. No difficult or sophisticated equipment is required. It is a very small simple set up that can be taken anywhere and performed almost anywhere. Indoors or outdoors. No electricity is required either.  It's very practical and straightforward. It is not a messy procedure either. It can be performed in ones small bedroom comfortably. I have put for purchase a full guide, with chemical sources and also sources for the coca at a cheap price. The coca never gets confiscated due to the way its sent. It can be sent pretty much anywhere from its country of origin and is cleverly disguised as another innocent product. Im here to walk your through every step as I have done many times with my customers. I enjoy enlightening people to this method of producing your own high quality cocaine. The price is merely for the time I have put into the work and guide itself, and also my quick responsive customer service before and after sale. You can ask anything at any stages or time and I will reply and help you understand whatever your enquiry regards. With my help, many of my customers have mastered this on the first go and got over the yields I have stated on subsequent extractions. It's very easy to learn once you actually get your hands dirty and get cooking.  There's also a calculator to help customers work out all chemical volumes and timings for each stage for whatever scale you wish to work at. With the guide you can produce 3.5g or 1000g. It all scales up. It's simple. Just ask me for advice on scaling up if your interested.  Any questions or quieries welcomes so feel free to private message me (PM) on this site or the market place regarding the listing or procedure.  I've had over 300 customers so far and most have ordered and received their leaf to produce the cocaine from.  Many have completed the process and you'll find feedback throughout this thread. The way the leaf is sent helps it pass through customs without problem, world wide. It is disguised and repackaged as another innocent health product and even relabelled to match.

From all the prices I've seen for cocoa leaves, unless you're selling the coke at stupidly high prices, you'd be better off buying coke. 1EUR/g cocoa leaf( undershooting it, based on http://buycocaleaves.com/coca-leaves/8-coca-leaves.html#/net_weight-10_grams ) Roughly 300g leaf/1g coke( http://ask.metafilter.com/66881/Why-is-coca-only-cultivated-in-South-America ) That's a 300k kilo of coke.",
Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-01-21T18:34:51,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Wrong. It is alot cheaper to do this method. Alot cheaper. As has been mentioned, the leaves are available for under Â£100 for a kilo. With this you can make 3.5g of pure cocaine. If it wasnt for the shipping price for the coca, the end product would cost less that Â£50 for 3.5grams of pure cocaine!!! I am selling the source for the leaves aswell as a guide with help if required. Much easier than spending a long time reading and piecing info together. This is literally a spoon feed method. Couldnt be easier. Well, you could always go to the jungle and watch them make it the same way I will teach you, but I bet it costs you more than Â£50! And your method wont be as clean and precise.  This method is an extraction guide it is not a synthesis. Very easy to perform with the correct knowledge.  Price is Â£50. Bargain I'd say for sure...

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-01-21T23:21:12,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"1g Cocaine at 80~% purity, made in the jungle without much cleanliness, shipped many thousands of miles by god knows what method = Â£120+ UK street prices. Or, with the guide offered: 1g 99% purity, made in clean environment in front of your own eyes, In 2/3 hours fresh as: Â£15~ Homemade Prices. With this method you could actually make a kilogram for around Â£15000~ Retailing at street level for Â£100,000~ =Â£85,000 profit~ , Wholesale price of Â£40,000/Â£50,000 = Â£25,000 / Â£35,000 profit. Now obviously, I would not suggest trying to cook up a kilo, as this would require alot of importing of the coca and a big operation. One could simply order enough to make an ounce every two weeks, or roughly 4 kilos of coca a week, and do this for around 1.5 years. Save the product up over this time and you will have a kilogram of pure cocaine with a street level value of Â£100,000.  Â£85,000 for a year and a half work  An amount roughly 1/4 of this was produced in a similar fashion over time by several friends in another country. I never buy street coke anymore. I just cant bring myself to do it. Once you have tried true PURE flake cocaine, it is hard to see the beauty in this fucking crap they sell over here. it is much better drug altogether when made properly and very pure, by yourself. After all, this is something your going to sniff up your nose. Who knows where that shit off the street is from. At least with my guide and methods when your finished there is no doubt what you have is very very pure high quality cocaine hydrochloride.  Good luck all, check my feedback if you have any doubts!  Cheers

This freebase crack would be very clean and much more stronger than anything off the street.  I can tutor buyers for this method also. A bonus is it takes a lot less time to perform. It cuts the processing down to 1/3 of the normal amount of work by stopping at the freebase stage.  It Would take about an hour and a half to produce roughly 6gram of cocaine base with the method.

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-02-19T19:41:19,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"If you have ten addresses to use for ordering to, 100g is not really a problem.. It would just require a few days of work to process the coca required for that level of extraction. You could make 50g and cut 50%. That would be less work and time involved. The product is 99.9% pure when produced with the method, cutting it 50% would still leave a good grade product. Probably better than most cut cocaine at that level:price.  For one person with one address I recommend ordering no more than 2/3 kilos of coca every ten days or so. That will produce over 10 grams of high quality cocaine.   1kilo regular would be too much work with this method and the risks are amplified alot.",

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-02-19T23:38:21,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"To make 10.5grams of ultra pure clean cocaine, it would cost around Â£180 for the coca and for that amount processing the chemicals would cost around Â£50-Â£60. Those chemicals would be an investment also though as they would last for much more than 10g worth of coca processing. You can reuse the chemicals for the next batch. You can save some money on what your buying at the moment and this stuff can even be cut 10%-20% and it's still very very strong due to its original high purity. So you can save even more money. Pure cocaine on the street is never truly pure or clean. This is connessiour cocaine.  You can make 10-15g every ten days comfortably at one address. More than that an I suggest splitting the shipments of coca up to several addresses. You don't need to do this, but it helps ensure the supplier stays around and no suspicion is around by customs for example.  35g has been made by ordering 7-8kilos of coca to one address in the past. So its not impossible, I just don't recommend it to often. Just to be safe...  There is no problem with shipping to Netherlands. I have customers around that area and friends who have ordered there and performed this without problem. Any other questions just ask

It's an exciting process for sure. If you do need any guidence I will be available to talk you through anything.  The investment for 3.5 is about Â£130-Â£150. The coca is a set price from the supplier, but the chemicals prices vary depending on the quantities you buy. If you invest what I have suggested above though you will have enough chemicals after you first 3.5g run to do several more runs of 3.5g without having to buy more chemicals  After your first run, your next few subsequent ones will cost you about half what I have suggested above, as you will only need to buy some coca to work with instead of the whole list of stuff.  Good luck.

As I told him I ACTUALLY bought and received my leaves...Now, recently I have acquired another level of success. A couple days ago, I DID IT!!! My first time ""out the gate""! I completed the first step. FB. I generated 6.1grs. CC, has a million dollar operation / guide. He's selling it for pennies (emphasis is mine, lol)!! CC, is extremely patient, yet thorough, and precise. The project was actually fun to perform. I live in a tiny apartment. With that said there is no space too small for this operation!  It is amazing to me that CC could possibly assist EVERYONE (but he does). I alone surely asked ""a thousand and one questions"", but thats because I wanted to THOROUGHLY understand the concept here (there is always a method to my madness). I felt that if this was bullshit that somewhere in the thousand and one ANSWERS, that there would be some inconsistancies (there were NONE)! This is TRULY an  AWESOME  guide to possess.. As I said earier in this thread..."" Take advantage people""!

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-03-17T23:11:02,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"8 places left for this week now. Also, not one shipment of coca leaf has been seized by customs. I have many customers in and around europe, USA, and a few other countries.  I would estimate so far potentially about 1/4 to 1/2 of a kilogram worth of very high purity flake cocaine is in the process of or has been produced through this method recently. Could be less, could be more! But I think that's a good estimate from what I've been tutoring customers through so far.  So, There are some rather impressive amounts of cocaine being produced now globally by my customers. Hopefully they can share their experiences with us or at least me to pass on. I'm sure we will see some gleaming photos with time. If anyone can keep any of it long enough that is...   The thing with this method is, once you know how to do it, you find yourself totally hooked. Not just on the cocaine, but the whole procedure . It's straightforward and once you know it your set. You won't forget it.  It's also alot of fun.  Good luck everyone, remember, post any questions or quieries or message me by PM directly if preferred. I'm open all hours.

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-03-18T12:59:15,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,You can make in the region of 3.5g upto 5g depending on your skills and practical experience. 3.5g is the average for a newbie. You can get more when you refine your knowledge and complete the process.  I can show you how to make more if you wish. 100g would be quite straight forward. It would take you alone about 4/5 days to process that amount comfortably. If you worked hard you could complete in a day or two though no problem.  Good luck.,

I believe it will be if you stick to the guide and source quality chemicals, you probably will recover twice the investment in the first cook and have left enough material excluding leaf to do more cooks.-5 out of 5, guide was updated making it even easier to follow up."

Australia has strict laws on just about everything, do you or anyone here know whether the leaf can be landed here successfully and if the other chemicals available are reasonably easy to source?

Hi CC, what's your thoughts on using the powder product which is available from the same site. I know it costs more but I don't mind paying more to reduce the labour! . Do you think it will work as well and produce the same yield? Do you think it will make it through the postal system as well as the other product does.

First: the leaves if they, at least in my country !!Second: I would anybody do the process as it is described but as I said made the mistake to overdo the ph when the base will precipitate (oxidation already included), all I saw so far was as described in the guide !! Chemical reactions were as described. that encourages me to think that this is very possible. I repeat, made the mistake to overdo the ph, and the base is not rushed for that reason. I say again that despite everything I have to see it with my own eyes, but I'm pretty sure it really works !! and another thing .. looking for information online, a journal of my country some years ago conducted a story of a group of people at home were extracting themselves cocaine hydrochloride leaves. this and much more information I've seen on forums who also made this process in the past, makes me think that this is very likely to be real, and as I said all I saw chemical reactions are exactly as described. If anyone does not believe in it, that doing here? and I repeat, I'm about to get the only thing I'm missing to complete the process and will write here the result. if it works I can not but thank you cocainecowboy because I always helped me understand this process to perfection. if it does not work will be a great disappointment !! but I'm pretty sure if I'll have success !!

It's very straightforward when you know how and have all the important pieces of the puzzle.  I and many friends have been doing this since the year 2002.

This was one of the best buys I ever made. You wont succeed prolly in the first place or get a big bag of yield, but you will notice it will work. But if you busy yourself with this materia you will have the best jay you every will have, believe me.There will be many questions in the beginning but here cowboy comes into play. You didnt spend all the money for that guide, mostly you pay for the dozens of answers you will get from him, and all of them will be answered, no matter what. This guy is the living cokebook. And the day will come you have your first own produced gear ready to go up your nose and you will go crazy cos of AWESOMENESS. Just put 20mg of your stuff in an EZtest and you will get the proof. You can get all the legal ingredients without any probs, and if some parcel takes longer its not his fault, and believe me it will arrive.So my final thoughts: If you like clean jay and are willing to learn buy that damn guide.If you are a moron or a know-it-all its ok, dont buy it but pls post your useless comments somewhere else. Thanks cc  And no, good cocaine doenst smell like rocket fuel.

I sent them a message and probably almost ten other email addressess that seemed to be associated with the company. Only the email that CC shared with me responded, basically confirming to me that the ""supplier"" is illegally licensed or some shit, or the language barrier is so bad they did not understand me.

Also worried about spending money somewhere and it coming marked as coca leaf or not the right kind coming and the whole process being a huge waste. Whenever the hell I find an actually reliable coca leaf supplier, I will put the guide to test. I guess I could get an ounce of leaf and miniaturize the whole thing, which will be super easy with CCâs included calculator.

Whenever the hell I find an actually reliable coca leaf supplier, I will put the guide to test. I guess I could get an ounce of leaf and miniaturize the whole thing, which will be super easy with CCâs included calculator.If you DO make an order with this ""supplier"" make sure you get an email address or something, because unless they change the way in which they operate, theres a chance you will get fucked out of your money if there is a shipping or packing error."
Evolution Forums,horseshoeface,206,2014-12-01T01:58:03,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"defraud the supplier? Like through my credit card company? And yes of course I made a login in and everything that I ordered through and can still login with. Still I did not receive an email when I made my order. I didnt really think about it until nothing arrived after a month. If someone has an email address that responds to them from someone who actually runs the site could they please PM me? It shouldnt be taking me months to figure out how to contact them. The email you sent me CC did not help at all. The people there literally said they had nothing to do with the website in question and agreed with me when I said then they are illegally using your copyright and impersonating your company. So I am fucking lost, and no I didnt do something wrong or anything, I did everything right, this website just has the worst service I have seen. Soon I am getting SOS registration and I can put my story there also. Again if someone could give me a real email to contact them I will give you my pgp through PM's but I am seriously frustrated and looking for other places to acquire leaf. I hate having to wait this damned long, probably have bought 300 dollars worth of coke so far since then already, which I dont even use much. And I am glad everyone else is receiving their orders fine with no problems, but this kind of makes me even more frustrated. At the very least I know how to make cocaine now, but so far the ""supplier"" has been completely unreliable for me. Like I said I have been spending the past like 3 months just trying to contact someone who could help me, going through at least 10 different emails. When I have like 50 bucks to just throw away maybe I'll order a tiny bit just to test out from them or their other shop I found with the same exact products.

Im going to see if I can find another company, unless somebody actually has a fucking email address of the company that works, but its kinda not easy in a market such as this. I was excited about this because of the supplier and how legit it looked, but now with the way I have been treated I am dissapointed and trying to figure out how to do the hardest part myself anyways. Everything else was quite easy to acquire, if this supplier was reliable, the way they handle business is easy and should be minimal hassles with it legally.

Evolution Forums,assasin,206,2014-06-11T18:23:30,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Ok as you said do not open the link its all ok i shall paste it here from a ebook I AM REALLY INTERESTED IN your ebook but dont want it to be the same as this Cocaine extraction from Coca LeavesReagents Needed:KeroseneSolid Na2CO3Distilled H2OH2SO4 5%Solid KMnO4 (6% Solution is used)NH4OH 10%HCl 37%AcetoneDiethyl EtherNote: The pictures were taken from 2 extractions performed with ~2Kg and ~5Kg of leaves, but allthe procedure outlined refers to the latter.Procedure:5 kilo bags of coca tea were opened bag by bag and the content was put in a bucket. A solution of containing 900gr of Na2CO3 dissolved in 9,5L was prepared. 4,750 grams of dried crushed coca leaves were mixed with this solution, using 1900ml of solutionfor each kilo of leaves. The mixing procedure was carried out in small batches of 500gr to distributethe water evenly. The leaves donât get too wet: water hardly comes out if you squeeze a handful. All the moistened leaves were put in an open top 50L container. 30 more minutes were waited andthen 25L of kerosene were added to the container.The mixture was left for 3 full nights (totalling ~60hours) and during the course of the 3 days it wasstirred at least 4 times in sessions of about 10-15mins using a drill mounted with that tool used byplasterers/decorators to mix buckets of paint with water. After 3 nights the kerosene was separated from the leaves (no water layer forms). The procedurewas carried out this way: all the kerosene on top was poured out in another 50L container filtering itwith some nylon stockings to prevent leaves from getting into the receiving container. Theremaining leaves were put, little by little, in a bucket with holes on the bottom while squeezing thekerosene out into a receiving bucket under the one with holes (a nylon stocking was used againbetween the 2 buckets). All the kerosene was the poured in the other 50L container. A 5% w/w solution of H2SO4 was prepared (this passage was done earlier).2 extractions with 5% H2SO4 were performed. The first one with 300ml the second with 100ml.Each time the container was shaken very hard (some emulsions form but almost nothing) for 30minutes and allowed to separate. The acidic water layer on the bottom was recovered each timeusing the old suck into the tube trick: the container was put 1 meter above ground, tilted 45% thena Polypropylene tube attached to a rod was driven inside the container to point at the lowestpossible spot inside the container and some sucking was performed on the other end of the tube.The H2SO4 started to come into a receiving container along with some kerosene as well towardsthe end. The 400ml of H2SO4, that we should call âagua ricaâ, and some kerosene were put in a 1Lsep funnel and let sit for ~30 minutes then separated. The emulsion was filtered and some moreagua rica was recovered. A solution of 6% KMnO4 was prepared and chilled in the fridge (this passage was done earlier).An ice bath was prepared and the beaker containing the agua rica was put there to chill until thetemperature reached 4-5Â° C. The colour of the liquid is reddish brown like red beer.Every 5-10 minutes 16ml of the KMnO4 solution were added with vigorous stirring. 8 additionswere made, totalling 128ml. After the last addition 30 minutes were waited and then the solutionwas filtered. MnO2 stayed on the filter and the resulting liquid (oxidized agua rica) is now fairly colourless. A 10% w/w solution of NH4OH was prepared (this passage was done earlier).An excess of this solution was slowly added until ph ~10. This passage was done very carefullymaking sure ph do not rise above 10 since it would damage the alkaloid.The Cocaine freebase starts precipitating and after about 20-30 minutes the solution was filtered. Alot of material was also stuck on the stirring rod and on the beaker.Everything was let dry overnight and some more drying was performed the morning after in theoven.The resulting material was dissolved in ~100-150ml of ether in the same container used the daybefore (the one with a lot stuck on the sides) and most of it dissolved but some dark brown goo thatstayed on the bottom (probably still a little bit of water and some inorganic salt); so little anywaythat it was not difficult to pour all the ether on a Pyrex baking dish to evaporate without pouring thegoo, that basically stayed glued to the bottom wall of the beaker.Once evaporated a very nice crystal formation was noted and the white freebase was recovered withthe aid of a razorblade and weighted 23,13g. Yield (Cocaine Base): 23.13g Cocaine Base / 4750g leaves = 0.48% 240ml of acetone were dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate and an equimolar quantity of HCl(6.58ml) was calculated and added to it. The calculation was done considering that only 230ml weregoing to be used.The freebase was dissolved in 240ml of ether and the acetone/HCl solution was added with stirringthe beaker was capped with cling film to prevent solvents from evaporation. After ~30 minutessome more stirring was performed and the some more acetone/HCl was added drop wise until therewas no more visible reaction (this can only be done when the solution is let sit for a little bit and isclear and not milky, as you would not notice it) 3 hours were waited and the solution was filtered. The filtrate was dried and weighted 24,14g.Yield (Cocaine HCl): 24,14g Cocaine HCl / 4750g leaves = 0.5% The process can be easily scaled down with the only precaution of using more H2SO4 than theproportional equivalent since it would be very impractical to use less than 50 ml in a 2 phaseextraction. Just bear in mind that the more H2SO4 you use the more Cocaine base you lose whenyou precipitate it with ammonia (0,17g every 100ml) even though the loss is reasonable to consider2 extractions of 70ml and 50ml for 500-1000gr of leaves.  OK HOPE U CAN SEE IT NOW OK THE METHOD U ARE SELLING IS IT THE SAME THING OR DIFFERENT THE ONLY THING GOOD WITH THE METHOD U SELLING IS SUPPLIER I GUESS HAS ANY1 EVEN RECIEVED leaves from supplier? the guide link has pictures for those interestedlike i said i am willing to buy it if its proper pukka",assasin wrote:just read thru most of the pagesnot trying to trash your thread but just wanted to know how long does the process takeis it the same method which has been public long ago which ishttps://anonfiles.com/file/c944775fb7442f0693328b53bf29efc5whats the yield like because with coca leave old old forums have said it was 0.8% the yield u estimate is that to its true liking and overall how long does it take for a noob a person who has lack of Lab experience what are the chances of it working?
Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-06-11T19:35:32,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"That is a procedure but it's not the one I am offering. I have in fact helped with the preparation of that particular information and wrote parts of it. it was some of the very first runs of this procedure that was performed. There is ALOT more detail than what you have posted there with what I offer. It's also Alot cleaner and a higher yielding procedure that is much simpler to perform no mess what so ever. You will struggle to get any yield following that procedure you mentioned as there are certain important pieces of information and specific details that have been omitted that you would only find out easily by using my service. I include many useful documents and calculators to help you work everything out exactly. Unlike what you have posted there. That is a basic work up but provides good proof this is possible.   The supplier has sent coca leaf to over 80 of my customers successfully.  Plus, I offer my private walk through assistance to help you through the process. The guide I offer is very indepth and walks you through everything like a step by step manual with everything explained fully in detail. Sources for everything is provided also. Including that, lots of images and diagrams  The guide is actually over 25 pages of information written by myself. Along with numerous other references and additional information files.

To my amazement My coca leaf was being delivered at that very moment. I now, OFFICIALLY, HAVE MY ORDER IN MY HANDS.

I've told you several times it's urgent for me.- All I was enquiring about if the level of production I've mentioned before is not available with this method, then what level is available ? I've only asked you to place that level(the available one) in NUMBERS so that I can calculate if it's a worth doing or just a waste of time.And of course, try to estimate the needed time to make that batch with the needed investment money aswell.

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-05-28T19:18:57,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"The way the product gets past customs is due to the way it is packaged. The supplier does not send a bag of whole coca leafs fresh with 'coca leaf' written on the package for all to see. Instead, they are quite clever with this product. It is re labelled, and packaged in such a way as to arouse no suspicion from customs. They actually see and believe it to be another innocent product. This helps it get past without problems.

Evolution Forums,darkhorse1990,206,2014-06-23T19:40:36,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"ItÂ´s a pretty good guide, you can clearly see that Cocainecowboy have put a lot of effort in it.  I am however a bit disappointed about what the cost price of the end product of 1 gram cocaine will be. You will have to pay $89 for the leaves  and $28 for the shipping costs (total of $117 to the Netherlands). If you divide this by 3.5 (the amount of cocaine of grams you can take out of this), you come on a costprice of $33,43 or Â£19.64 or â¬24.58 per gram, next to this you also have to invest in chemicals. So I think the total costprice of 1 gram cocaine will be around â¬30 per gram.  This is a total difference of the  Â£15 (â¬18.77) per gram you were talking about in the beginning of this thread.   pls correct me if I am seeing something wrong Cocainecowboy,

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-06-23T21:02:53,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,3.5g is the lowest end of the product range you can produce with this method and the average for first time runners. After a few initial practice runs or quick learners you can actually produce around about 4.5/5g with this method when done accurately. As I also state in the guide and my comments.  Why don't you give it a go and actually try the end product rather than trying to shoot this down....?,
Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-06-23T21:09:39,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Your price of Â£30 per gram is highly inaccurate. How can you possibly make up that amount of money for the very small amount of chemicals needed to produce one gram of cocaine? The chemicals are an initial investment, for the Â£50/Â£60 you spend on those chemicals, if purchased correctly with my help as I also offer with the guide as you probably saw, you can make quite a lot of cocaine,at least 10x/20x/30x the stated yield of cocaine.... You will not need to buy them for a long time.    Not to mention, this cocaine is the best you can get. Pure, clean and fresh. You won't have seen anything like it. In the jungles they do not go to the lengths we will go to, to purify and clean the end product.  Your making it yourself. Done properly, you can't get a safer drug experience than that. No addulterants. Made in a clean environment. Every stage observed by your own eyes. The perfect experience if you ask me!

When i do my calculations the process is most definitely profitable, but just like you I am also a person that focuses on the details and I thought the costs would be slightly lower then it is, even though it is already low.

Would like to hear results from Evo member/regular instead of guy with 2 posts on this forum (No offense CC). Looks very intriguing though.. Excited to hear extraction results.

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-05-10T15:45:57,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"It's one of those things I suppose, when your making illegal drugs yourself at home its not a wise thing to go telling everyone about it. I think perhaps that's why people are reluctant to speak of any success. I'll do my best to get some other customers to post reviews. It has to be said though alot of customers are indeed very new and would likely have very small post count There is alot of evidence out there that this is totally possible. Think of how they make it in the jungles of columbia. They don't have sophisticated equipment or chemicals. I understand the process they follow and have improved it greatly after alot of research when performing the procedure. The equipment and chemicals are still very basic and easy to aquire cheaply. Unlike in columbia etc where alot of chemicals have been made illegal due to their use in this process, thus leading to use of impure chemicals and in turn an impure end product, they are very much legal in most other countries. We can produce a superior product, in Greater yield, with much more simplicity. Customers have followed my guide and produced their own high quality and high purity flake cocaine successfully and enjoyed the product very much. People are astounded as to what they have wasted their money on with so called pure cocaine on the streets once they try this superior product.  Nobody is offering a full walk through guide with added personal tuition on this subject like I am. That's the major difference to what's available elsewhere. I am very knowledgeable in this subject and have a lot of experience. I am around to answer any questions, quieries or provide a full walk through service. I answer in alot of detail and explain things as best I can to help people understand and learn about the procedure they are doing. I enjoy this   Hope that helps brother.

I did however keep some of the Freebase to try and it was very very good shit  like CC says ""very moreish"" . Can't wait to try the end product as from smoking the freebase I know it's going to be special. CC will help with any questions you may have as he has with me, if your interested in this process and want to try real cocaine this is for you. It has changed my life. Thank you CC",

For about Â£100 you will receive about 0.7/0.8g of cocaine. Many dealers sell these 0.7g or 0.8g as grams. It's ridiculous!  So anyone who doesn't think this is worth it in that respect either has a problem with maths or is in a major production Country such as Colombia where I believe the rate for 1g of cocaine is about $10,

I bought the tutorial from CC a while ago, and studied and got hands on all the chemicals I needed, and also ordered so I had a bit of leaves in case I screwed up! around new years I finally got myself to give it my initial go, and one day later I had my hands on perfect sparkly cocaine. I did not have the chance to test purity of my final product, but it was hard hitting! My only earlier experience with coke is street coke, and I can say this product killed it!  I can see several posts here about tutis not worth buying? Bullshit! At least from where I am in Scandinavia, Street coke is about 20% pure in general, with a price of 80Â£.So 70Â£ for 3,5G pure good quality coke? compared to 240Â£ for 0,6G pure on the streets? Not worth it? come on! I obiously envy you because you are very rich. I am preparing myself to make a bigger extraction, with this extraction I will make a guide as well with pictures available to all of CC`s customers!

I used the suggested source for leaves, along with an alternative. My alternative source was really easy to find as soon as I knew the suggested one. The name of the coca leaves is kind of discrete so I think that makes it easier to clear customs. Thats just my thought because the leaves were hold in customs at one point, but still got through. I first bought this guide June 12th. and had my first batch ready just last week. I have studied this guide, and all the other info on the web I could find. Sourced the chemicals and supplies needed from all over the world to have the best setup to match my underqualified chem experience.  My first batch was perfect! Except a little less yield than hoped for. But all in all IÂ´m very pleased with this product.

Quite a lot of leaf has been delivered recently to various different customers so good luck to all!

This stuff isn't like anything you will find on the street. It's super pure and super strong. It's made with cleanliness and accuracy. It's not made in the jungle with people under ponchos with sweaty feet stamping all over coca leafs all day. It's made with love and care, and good chemistry.  You can cut this stuff alot and still sell it as very high quality gear. 25k for a kilo of this grade cocaine would be an amazing bargain for the buyer   8 placements available until next weeks top up.","sensaiy36 wrote:Anybody actually getting their leaf?

Wow! That's all I can say. Clean, clear high. Super strong instant hit. Feels like someone just switched a light on in my head. Jaw is swinging about all over the place. Good work I say!  Yield was 4.2g oxidised cocaine hydrochloride from just under a kilo of coca leaf. The gram looks like a great 2g bag. Light and fluffy, the lines you make with this look like they will kill you they are so big due to the crystals  being so light   No fiending for another line, this stuff has got legs an has a good clean (no headache or sickness) long lasting hit. 6 placements available.

I have yet placed an order with them, but they do look like a legitimate company. They also allegedly ship worldwide. Prices also look great, if you was to buy 10kg of Coca Leaves it will only amount to $999, which is $99/kg. With CocaineCowboy's guide which shows you how to extract 3.5g of pure cocaine from 1kg of coca leaves, it is most definitely a bargain. In addition to this, when ordering 10kg of coca leaves or more, you have the payment option of paying them with Bitcoins. In the near future I will place an order of 45 grams of coca leaves for $35.99 to see how all goes. I will then leave feedback on here, but I don't know exactly when this will be.

I received no reply from the user at all, which is quite unusual considering the problem they mentioned they had, which was not receiving the leaf ordered.  Why no reply?  Also, iv had over 100 customers and everyone has received their leaf. Iv had customers from many many different countries. Country of origin customs do allow the leaf to leave the country. It is a very common product there. Surely, if people wasn't receiving their leaf they would say something publically here on the thread or on my feedback at the marketplace.

I have my family living with me so need to be careful. Do I need a lot of space or can this be done in the kitchen with minimal space. Would I be using huge buckets and containers or would they be small. If they are small then I can explain them away but if theyre huge, it might need a lot more explaining. Would there be fumes, would I need ventilation. Or is the whole process so small in size that it can be explained away by telling them that I am making home made shampoo or something? PS and also how big is the coca package when delivered? thankssolly

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-10-16T15:15:58,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,Cocaine and mdma.  I think alot of mdma that is going around at the minute is not actually mdma and rather mda or some research chemicals. Same with the LSD scene.  Cocaine is easy and profitable. It does not require any complicated lab equipment or much investment.  Mdma on the other hand does require lab equipment and has a significant outlay cost attached.,

Evolution Forums,Cocainecowboy,206,2014-04-21T17:18:47,"Re: [Vouched] Step by step guide to homemade Cocaine.Tutorial,Sources&Help",Guides Vendors,"Hey now brother. Good to see some interest. No problem at all regarding your questions. Here's some answers.  The weights and prices I quote are for grams of product and in pounds sterling. I am based in Europe and these figures reflect the market well. The price of cocaine in the last few years has increased alot, so this has made this guide even more profitable. I originally pursued this project to experience true pure cocaine, not to make money. But i have made alot from it in the past non the less. The price per grams I have quoted is in pounds sterling Coca is not legal in most countries but is tolerated and allowed through in many places as the innocent product I have used to make the cocaine for years as have many others. The bonus with my guide is I have found a supplier that sends the coca, but labels it differently and disguises it as another innocent product. This guarantees is arrives. In the ten years iv been doing this along with many others, and the many customers who have ordered after buying the guide, no one has had their coca seized when shipped, and iv dealt with people in many different countries around the world.  The time involved all depends on you and is difficult to predict. The chemicals are easy to get and I recommend buying online from eBay. Nothing is watched or illegal. You can get it all delivered next day, but it depends how quick you wish to receive the items. In total,from buying the guide I would say about ten days  to gather all products and receive coca leaf. Recieveing the coca leaf being the thing that takes the most time. Producing product takes a further day to 3 days depending how fast you wish to go. The procedure is in three stages with time between each stage to rest or wait for more time to continue. You can perform the procedure over a few weeks if you wish. Or longer. It's very flexible.  You won't be using any electrical products or naked flames during the procedure, so there isn't a real risk of explosion or fire although you will be using flammable chemicals such as kerosene and acetone. The list of chemicals is small, and you will only be working with very small volumes of chemicals too.  Your work space sounds perfect.   I hope that answers your questions and helps you.  All the best, good luck, ask any other questions you have.",

Im very impressed indeed. They managed this with just over 8kg of coca leaf which is very good going for a newbie. Works out about Â£15 a gram, call it Â£18 with chemicals and equipment included. Not bad at all.  With practice, this can be made even cheaper. The fact that they actually still have enough chemicals left to produce a few addition batches of this scale means that the end cost is lowered further anyway.  If anyone has any questions about the procedure or anything involved, please get in touch either here or at the evolution marketplace. I'm around most hours of the day to answer  Good luck to all interested. CC

But then i start looking and your guide with all the feedback look more legit than ""10kg coke bulk"" and ""buy cheap coke if you travel (or pay us) to columbia"" - and, well, it's only 80 bucks compare to 40,000$ or 6,000$, haha. And it's all after i spend my last btcs on normal coke... Fuck. But okey, i'll buy it in next week when i rebuy some btc and hopefully it will be worth it.  Question before buy - is there any limit of ""suspicious orders"" - i mean, you said that for 1g pure coke you need 0,3kg stuff - so if i wanna make 100g month then i need around 30kg of coke leaves - even if it's legal (as long as it's not a cocaine), was you or any of your customer or anyone you know have trouble when order more of this stuff? Like someone who came to him (or you) and ask why you buy 30kg of some leaves? ""I like making tea of it"" isn't sounds like good responde for it.

In relation to previous poster, I will send you a PM, but basically the coca leaf is disguised as another product and re labelled. It doesn't state on the packaging its coca leaf. So it passes customs without question.  If your producing that amount per month there is a way to automate some of the procedure. It saves alot of time. You can achieve yields of 100g using about 20kg of coca leaf.   Cheers",

Evolution Forums,Jacky78,54325,2015-03-09T21:42:29,Re: [PREMIUM] Make $5K/month with PayPal! *FREE Fullz*,Guides Vendors,"I'm going to be very honest with you since you seem to be a realistic guy and I'm not here to sell you a magic pill. It takes time & money to make money. In this case, at the very minimum $150 in addition to the guide to start. Then you will also need time. I would say 4-5 hours for the first week every day AT MOST if you're a complete noob and everything in my guide is new to you. It's basically the time needed to buy the fullz, create the accounts, etc. From there, it will be at most 1 hour per day since it's the aging process.  So there you have your answer: a few hours at the start, then one hour a day for 2-3 weeks (1 month is better) and that's it. ROI depends on how much you invest. With a $150-200 investment, you can make at least 1K. Yes, here you go: Other vouches are in the main post.","h34dphuck wrote:The biggest issue I have is time.  I have money, I have cards, fullz etc. and ways of profiting - but I also have a job IRL, a very important and time consuming job... so for me the biggest fuck off of all is when I can't commit properly to expanding my methods and knowledge.How much time, and being realistic, will I need to commit per day, and will this be every day per week, to ensure this ROI? I am just looking for facts not dreams, I want to know if I can build this into my schedule - potentially with some chemical assistance. haha.;david01 wrote:any vouches from noobs?;shikamaru wrote:Alright as promised, I am ready to post my review on this guide. I am the regular member that the guide was given too. I am posting this review from the standpoint of a newbie. Ive been researching for a couple months now planning out my rise to the top in fraud, trying to make sure I have all the bases covered before I dive into this shit, but i have learned quite a bit already and could probably start today. Anyways, let me start off by saying that I think this guide is WELL worth the price. I was thinking that it was going to be more but I see above that the current listing is for $149 and I think it is worth every damn penny. I found this guide very easy to read, It is well worded and there are almost no mistakes in spelling/grammar at all. Right now I feel like I learned more about Paypal than I have in all my studies and searches this last few months. Jacky is very clear with the descriptions and not vague at all. The guide is not extremely long, and is an easy read, but I honestly feel more confident than ever now about paypal. It seems like less of a mystery to me. I mentioned to Jacky that for someone inexperienced such as myself, there may be technicalities that one may run across, but with the help of this guide I believe these can all be solved by yourself. So while after purchase support is always good, I doubt it will be needed at all. You more experienced guys should run into no issues at all of that kind. If you already know about paypal and have made a few transfers, or you're paying others for services, and maybe your success rate is less than perfect, then this is for you! Jacky describes how to do everything yourself with paypal from scratch, which will save you a lot of money. Anyways, this deserves the good review I'm giving and I'll be surprised if any of the other vouchers disagree on this. I can't wait to put this to use I'm actually about to read this again to further engrave it into my brain. Thanks again Jacky for the vouch copy. If you're considering getting this guide, I suggest to get it before the price goes up. It will make your paypal experience easier and save $$ which is always a good thing! I cant really even think of any question right now that I need to ask I know I got this free but even If I paid for it I feel I would be pretty satisfied. -honest reviewBest regards,Shikamaru."

It depends on how much time youâre willing to invest, but the minimum is 2 weeks. [?] How much can I expect to make? Well, if youâre dedicated and only do one setup, you will be able to make between 2k and 5k. However, I would suggest doing multiple setups at the same time to make even more! [?] Is this guide about selling fake items on eBay or using hacked PayPal accounts? Are the methods going to be outdated or saturated? No, this is the real deal. Itâs truly the cleanest way you could expect to make money with PayPal, so donât worry about the methods getting saturated. [?] Does this work everywhere, in the US, EU and other countries? Yes, it works everywhere and as a proof of that, I live outside the United States. However, we will be using US accounts even if itâs always possible to create and use accounts from other countries. [?] Will you provide free updates?Yes! In case I find out that a method isn't working anymore, I will update the guide right away and provide for free the update to all buyers. I will also update the guide with new cashout methods. [?] Does this work with PayPal MyCash? With Yasuo's aged middleman accounts? With PayPal transfers you can buy on Evo? Yes, yes and yes. Although with my method you can make much more than with Paypal MyCash or transfers (because of the high rate), they will perfectly work. As for Yasuo's accounts, they are already aged and all they need is transaction history. This will speed up the process and you will have your money way faster. [?] What kind of support can I expect from you after I purchase the guide? I will answer to simple questions asked by private message (please do not pollute my threads) whenever possible. If the answer is in the guide, I will point you in that direction. [?] Why is this only $199 if you can make $5K/month? Well, since I'm a new vendor I decided to start with a low price in order to get more reviews. However, I have planned on increasing the price of the guide after a few copies have been sold and eventually stop selling it to prevent leaks/saturation.  Current price: $199Marketplace link : http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/98663  Reviews Let's start with hugo's review. He's considered by many people as a ""PayPal Master"" so I really wanted to hand him a vouch copy. Here is what he has to say:    Terms of service [x] You are not allowed to leak this guide; doing so will result in a permanent ban.[x] You must release escrow after youâve successfully downloaded the guide. [x] You are not allowed to dispute a successful transaction. If you do, you will be added on the blacklist (we have a shared blacklist between vendors).[x] Blacklisted members are not able to purchase this guide.[x] I have the right to cancel your order if your account doesn't meet my buyer criteria.

Jacky makes an introduction to PayPal and refers some strong points that other guides don't refer too. Maybe because they were lazy, maybe because it was so obvious to them that they either made a small comment or just implied it and hope the reader would get the reference.Another thing I liked is that he advises certain services for the products you need, so instead of saying ""Get a bank drop and connect it here"", he tells you where can you actually get the bank drop.Talking about the methods referred, I like all of them. The only one I'd be careful about is his transaction history one, as I've experienced some trouble with that one. If you buy the guide, be really careful about that one, as I've seen one account get limited and the others that received the money get also limited because PayPal managed to connect them. If you follow his guide though, PayPal will have an harder time doing the connection.He also talks a bit about PayPal Credit, and how can you make money off it. It's good if you happen to have a database full of DOB/SSN lying around.Finally, he addresses PayPal limitations and he indicates you a great service. And I really mean great, they have everything you'll probably need.Conclusion If you're looking to get into PayPal, this is more than a great ""first step"". Buy this, do as he says, and in 2-3 weeks time you'll be buying transfers and raping PayPal.Good luck with your sales!;shikamaru wrote:Alright as promised, I am ready to post my review on this guide. I am the regular member that the guide was given too. I am posting this review from the standpoint of a newbie. Ive been researching for a couple months now planning out my rise to the top in fraud, trying to make sure I have all the bases covered before I dive into this shit, but i have learned quite a bit already and could probably start today. Anyways, let me start off by saying that I think this guide is WELL worth the price. I was thinking that it was going to be more but I see above that the current listing is for $149 and I think it is worth every damn penny. I found this guide very easy to read, It is well worded and there are almost no mistakes in spelling/grammar at all. Right now I feel like I learned more about Paypal than I have in all my studies and searches this last few months. Jacky is very clear with the descriptions and not vague at all. The guide is not extremely long, and is an easy read, but I honestly feel more confident than ever now about paypal. It seems like less of a mystery to me. I mentioned to Jacky that for someone inexperienced such as myself, there may be technicalities that one may run across, but with the help of this guide I believe these can all be solved by yourself. So while after purchase support is always good, I doubt it will be needed at all. You more experienced guys should run into no issues at all of that kind. If you already know about paypal and have made a few transfers, or you're paying others for services, and maybe your success rate is less than perfect, then this is for you! Jacky describes how to do everything yourself with paypal from scratch, which will save you a lot of money. Anyways, this deserves the good review I'm giving and I'll be surprised if any of the other vouchers disagree on this. I can't wait to put this to use I'm actually about to read this again to further engrave it into my brain. Thanks again Jacky for the vouch copy. If you're considering getting this guide, I suggest to get it before the price goes up. It will make your paypal experience easier and save $$ which is always a good thing!

That's all there is to it.  When I asked about this he acted like he had no idea and thought it was in there and then brushed it off and said ""just do the same thing you would do otherwise.""  That is an unsatisfactory answer and I can tell he became agitated for me even questioning this.  I don't give a fuck how pissy you get, you said it was in there AND IT'S NOT. You think I should be satisfied with that? I paid for something I told I would get- and didn't get it.  How is that any different from ordering top shelf weed from a vendor and getting ditchweed that's half shake?  $90 not well spent.  Lesson learned- don't leave feedback before going through the whole thing.",

I am going to keep this short and sweet. You came here because you want to either make big bucks or become the next biggest iPhone seller in your area. Great. Now, I'm going to tell you how. Not only has this method worked for me, but I have now made it available to the public for purchase. iPhone carding has always been the first thing that noob carders usually try and do, they head to Apple.com and try their luck at taking a bite. With a shit success rate, you're just bound to fail... Until now. What if you could card iPhone's through the easiest and most simplistic processor available (Stripe)? What if you didn't have to get your hands dirty and could use a 3rd party to do it for you? What if you could have a method that is not bound to get burnt? All of these are a carders dream come true and I have the method you want. I have recreated the entire method to specifically card Apple products, although, this doesn't limit you to them and allows you to card stuff other than Apple as well. Even though I am releasing this method to the public, I am only going to be selling 6 copies (ONLY 5 ARE LEFT!). Below is what you will receive: Now, along with the above, you receive my complementary 12/7 support at your fingertips and will be able to contact me through Jabber or ICQ with any questions you may have.  I can guarantee you that this method is like nothing you have ever seen before. You will not be carding through Apple. What are you waiting for?:  http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/101007 1. 2. 3.

 - A full and complete setup, including any necessary tools you need to get started.

I've had a thorough read and I've ran a test using one of my own fullz and I must say that this method is absolutely second to none. I've never seen this type of usage before when it comes to carding and I don't know how or where you found out about this Twinz but it's golden. Anybody who doesn't buy is simply foolish. I feel privileged to of received a vouch copy so I thank you for that, I'll keep it very close to me and guard it with triple encryption along with my other sensitive data Very well written, simple to understand and beginner friendly although basic knowledge on carding and social engineering would be advantageous. Great potential here to make some good money, theoretically it's getting someone else to do your dirty work! And they say there's no such thing as a free lunch Best of luck with sales Twinz, I'm sure all customers of this guide will be more than happy, and if they're not then I call bullshit!- Courvoisier;weightedb wrote:Just received the guide and read over it.  I must say, this seems pretty golden.  Without going into detail, what TheTwinz says is true, you are basically using a 3rd party to card for you and have it sent to your drop.  It does take some setting up to do which is of course expected, however, it is really not that much at all.  I have honestly never heard of this or even knew this existed, and I have been in the game for a while now.  You can make this as big or as small as you want it.  If you want to just card an iPhone for yourself and be done, you can.  Or if you want to scale it huge and multiply the method, it can very easily be done with just more time and supplies and you could be carding 10 Macbooks a day.  Even though the carding is not the hard part (it's stripe), the only hindrance you will have is the quality of your card.  If you card is shit or chargebacks immediately, this will not work.  So I recommend finding the best of the best cards you can.  Everything else is basically set in stone.  You will need a burner phone that can text however no actual live talking to anyone is required, which is a huge plus.TheTwinz lays out in stone step by step how to do it and provides you with all the necessary tips and tools needed to overcome any hiccups there may be.  As far as saturation of burning the method, I do not really see it happening.  That said, I do hope he sticks to his promise of only selling 6 copies.  If too many people start doing it all at once then they will eventually catch on and increase security measures.  They can never completely stop you from doing it or their business would no longer exist but security could increase and make it more difficult.  However I do not see it happening anytime soon at all.  If you buy the method it certainly will not be burnt by the time you try it.If you have drop addresses and good cards, I do not see how you could not make good money with this method.;Smartcile wrote:For all the fuckwits in this thread that think that this method is bullshit blah blah, well buy it or GTFO. I wish tbh the twins would not sell the method so I could have it all to myself. Before he even labeled it as a way to card apple I purchased the guide. If you know your shit about BINS and carding in general plus some SE skills then there is no reason why you can't make a good grand or two off this method. FFS in the first day I used all my old cards I didn't need and got 1 iPhone and 1 MacBook Air plus I just got my tickets to go back to see my fiancee. SO buy it or leave it. Simple. Full review coming soon.And to those who buy it DONT FUCKING LEECH IT! This has proven so useful to me, protect your investment!"

Because I used them before I was arrested. I don't want to risk my freedom again and simply don't have the time to execute them as I have a day job, which is part of the current image I need to reproduce before I can proceed in fraud again, which even then, I may not.  I don't like committing fraud or stealing from people. So why not use the methods I've learned and used to swear by, and sell them for an extra $500 in my pocket? I make both parties happy and still get to keep the experience with the method to myself, which in all honestly, is the real secret. So please don't accuse me of selling faulty or non-working guides. I pride myself in sharing valuable and working knowledge. Although it may be at a cost, it's only to protect its integrity and worthiness.

This method is working and is easy as I claim. I'm not going to get banned, because I don't sell bullshit methods. Read what I said above.  I've noticed you troll a lot of threads. I highly suggest you count your pennies and TRY some of my methods. You have to realize that everything goes through this beautiful system called an escrow, meaning I don't get your money until it is released, by you. I find it quite humorous that people are so greedy on this forum that they don't account for honest ex-carders trying to not pursue a career in fraud. To be honest, I don't know about you, but I've been having some great sleeps and I'm an all-round happier person with my current job. Fraud isn't something I want to do anymore. If times start to get rough again, of course I'll go back to fraud to survive, but it isn't something I need or want right now in my life.  So how about instead of slandering my methods, go prove to me you can find something working for Apple Carding, because mine sure as hell does.

My other guide is really basic, you need to find your own twists to it and really figure out what to do when you get the method.  Now this method is more advanced, yes, it's based off my other guide but it goes into more depth and really shows you step-by-step how to achieve success. You are also supplied with all the necessary tools and everything you need to get started immediately. Of course anyone could go buy my other guide and try replicating what I've come up with here, but the $150 higher charge is definitely worth the headache.  Another thing is my other guides increase per sale. This will one stay at a flat rate of $500 and never increase. I hope that answered your question mate","fulham wrote:TheTwinz wrote:What if you could card iPhone's through the easiest and most simplistic processor available (Stripe)?

TheTwinz lays out in stone step by step how to do it and provides you with all the necessary tips and tools needed to overcome any hiccups there may be.  As far as saturation of burning the method, I do not really see it happening.  That said, I do hope he sticks to his promise of only selling 6 copies.  If too many people start doing it all at once then they will eventually catch on and increase security measures.  They can never completely stop you from doing it or their business would no longer exist but security could increase and make it more difficult.  However I do not see it happening anytime soon at all.  If you buy the method it certainly will not be burnt by the time you try it. If you have drop addresses and good cards, I do not see how you could not make good money with this method.

I've had a thorough read and I've ran a test using one of my own fullz and I must say that this method is absolutely second to none. I've never seen this type of usage before when it comes to carding and I don't know how or where you found out about this Twinz but it's golden. Anybody who doesn't buy is simply foolish. I feel privileged to of received a vouch copy so I thank you for that, I'll keep it very close to me and guard it with triple encryption along with my other sensitive data  Very well written, simple to understand and beginner friendly although basic knowledge on carding and social engineering would be advantageous. Great potential here to make some good money, theoretically it's getting someone else to do your dirty work!

Evolution Forums,hellrazor,23569,2014-09-13T17:53:02,Re: â| The Four Horsemen 2nd ed.| ladron2 | Blackhat Business Intelligence,Guides Vendors,"My Review on the Four Horseman 2nd edition. I rate this guide 5stars and 20/10 this is an elite guide, The price on this is nothing compare to what you get when you  purchase guide. This must be in the top 3 guides on the deep web and is a must have in your collection of guides.Moka is just fucking brilliant the way he explains the method an breaks it down in different stages  and walks you threw each step with pain staking details makes it very simple to follow with pictures an charts and all.This updated versions is even better than the first version, adding even more cash out alternatives than  previous version. You  will get multiple resources like bank application, mailing forms, ladron v+1.2,word press plug-ins, videos these are just a few things included in the package. You will learn multiple ways of getting clean rdps, Moka also walks you threw how to manage an environment created all by yourself using the components outlined in guide to bring you multiple streams of income at the same time . Guide has everything you need to run a complete total operation getting paid at will. Most of all cashing out will be a breeze once you are u and running. Guide takes effort and a little computer skills but it is well worth the rewards. This will be the last guide you buy. Thanks again to moka.",

You shouldn't wait.  If you are interested in that product you should go ahead and get it.  The new update is much much better than what was originally released. The Voxis team and i have been talking for some time.  The new ladron2 parser actually uses the same format as the Voxis platform and I have more plans, like you said, around January.   Remember that I write documents, not software.  If anything, jumping on Voxis now may give you an advantage.  Current 4HM readers should know exactly where that product would fit.  I don't consider us competing if we're all working towards the same end result, get it?  $_$  Thanks

Putting me and moka's acquaintance relationship aside, this is definitely if not one of the most incorporated well though out, planned, appealing, knowledgeable, fun to read Guides out there.  moka gives you an excellent introduction that will get you hooked onto the idea of being innovative and starting your own venture, he shares his own background story and opinion on the aspect of being a successful business owner. I've always thought highly of moka with the resources and information he has to bring to the table and he never disappoints.  In this guide, your hand is LITERALLY held throughout the whole way on operating your own 5, 6, 7 figure income. This is not a get quick rich scheme and get caught 3 days in because you're too greedy. This is a successful start up procedure that requires patience and time. The only reason you will fail or not be successful is because of one reason, you're being LAZY. Stop thinking every time you leave your home and need to get somewhere it will be a highway, you'll always be getting there fast, no, there are residential roads, business infrastructures, speed bumps, detours, etc. It isn't going to always be a highway.  Actually, let me stop that for a second after your business launches and is successful it's a highway all the way but not from the start you greedy lazy bastards.  In conclusion, the more innovative, patient, and hungry you are. You will no doubt retire in paradise. Not going to give the whole alphabet rating and scale rating but; A+ and 10.1/10. Stop fucking around and purchase this if you want real QUALITY, ORIGINAL, THOUGHT OUT information that will give you that opportunity to not have to work at your shitty desk job or min wage. This guide is considered dirt cheap for all the time he has put into it.",

Evolution Forums,moka,23569,2014-09-18T22:58:38,Re: â| The Four Horsemen 2nd ed.| ladron2 | Blackhat Business Intelligence,Guides Vendors,"Very applicable in the EU but you need to make a choice --  1)  A single US bank drop will prob cost around $150 to ship to you in EU (approx) but US CVV data is very cheap.   2)  You use a bank drop in your local country / currency but you pay more for CVV data.  For example, Spanish CVVs are usually 12 - 15 USD while good, valid US CVVs can be had first hand for around 3 USD each.   That said, I don't think the cashplus accounts will work.  I don't know.  Ask Michaelis.   Remember we're not actively exploiting anything.  It's all business logic ""hacking"".  It totally depends on the resources available to you.

Speak to Moka every so often with updates and what not, my main stripe atm is on $20,000 total cashout and has $1,000 due today and another $2500 tomorrow, tomorrow once the $2500 has cleared ill push through another $2500 for fridaySome reason if i put in any charges on a friday, the ""transfer"" schedule says monday or tuesday (normally tuesday)  I'm from UK and use US banks for this, so it could be a US banking thing ? I try to run 3 stripes, alongside 3 worldpays at any given time Once the stripes are dead, i market my sites and put delivery time as ""7-12 days"" on all items, SEO them more and do some social media marketing and allow Paypal and WorldPay integration,People order, if you do your SEO right you can cashout the paypal with around $2000-3000 extra before ""paypal disputes"" appear... Easy money This way each ONE bank account is attached to 3 gateways i know are easy to do with this. Try to open 2 new stripes a week but obviously since this isn't my main income its not a 9-5 for me, but i will say... If someone treated this like a 9-5 and not some ""get rich quick scheme"" and cut corners... you would make some insane money. Currently here in the UK I transfer funds from #Debit1 to #Debit2 #Debit3 #Debit4 and withdraw Â£230 (GBP) off each on an ATM a day  thats Â£920 a day free money.I don't add the new debits to the stripe as itll burn them for any future use with stripes, it's annoying and a bit slow having to do $900 transfer per 12hours i think it is (my banks i use limit) but... Why am i in a rush ? It's literally free money.  --- Edit // Update --- Just some free pointers for anyone who is new to this. I suggest once your site has cleared the probation period to keep any funds you put through to max of $375 a transactionI do $375 on each card, then repeat. I use ISellPizza's Cards and Yasuo's Latest Base.Don't be too greedy and put through more than you think is ""needed"" the worse feeling is being due a big payout and getting the generic ""fuck you"" email from stripe or any processor.

Going well people just remember to keep it realistic and you should be fine, if your stripe gets suspended a few times... don't give up, all you need is one good one.","oracle wrote:AleksandrM,Got it!

Evolution Forums,AleksandrM,23569,2014-10-02T23:33:43,Re: â| The Four Horsemen 2nd ed.| ladron2 | Blackhat Business Intelligence,Guides Vendors,"Just a update, My main stripe is at $37,500 total now and still going... $3,097 transfer going in tomorrow, and a further $1850 day after (to make it so two of my cards have $5k on them) then will do another $3500 to a fresh card. My second, third and fourth stripe has passed the 5 day probation i give my accounts, although it has been added to that ""7 day cashout for a month"" thing, but really it's not a problem if you use decent cards...7days isn't bad.and if you play it right and charge say 5 cards a day for 3 days...1 weeks time you've got 3 days of consecutive cashouts. The thing i can't stress enough about this is don't get greedy and charge huge amounts in one transaction per card, i personally keep it below $400. Don't get greedy and be realistic, you aren't going to get the same success as Moka or other members here have had on your first attempt, once you've got a bank drop and fullz... sign up to other payment processors and try your luck aswell don't just stick to stripe.  Have had allot of members message me for advice, I'd love to reply to each and every one of you but i don't have the time nor the patience which is why i'm not a vendor. The only advice i can give you that is solid is 1. Read Moka's guide back to front, DO NOT RUSH 2. Don't get greedy3. Stay calm if a stripe gets closed, IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. Goodluck y'all (y)  Sorry for long post i just imagine if i am getting allot of PM's a day i dread to think what Moka goes through and he was extremely patient with myself when i was learning this so trying to take a bit of the load up with some ""real talk"" for people   P.S.  Don't base my figures on what you are going to get, honestly (Ask Moka) i was absolutely ecstatic when my first UK account got to like $5000-10000 and i thought it wouldn't get better, just stay consistent.

(true story) Regardless, Stripe isn't the main component.  There isn't a focus on one particular company to smash and grab.  It's a way of doing things.

What can I say... awesome. Saturatable/burnable? No, because it's not exploiting anything actively. What amounts can be made? Literally no limits. As much as You desire. Of course, it doesn't mean, You won't have to put some work in. But fuck, nothing comes without an effort. Same thing about JungleMoney, except it's bit easier (I think). Actually, You can combine both to get HUGE success. Guides are written in very professional manner, easy to understand. I had to ask Moka some questions, though. He is pretty busy, but that doesn't make after sale customer support suffer at all. Received the guides instantly, even with a bonus  So, if any of you guys are in doubt to buy or not, please do not hesitate. It's pretty expensive, but you get some top notch shit for that money. 10/10 would buy again. Edit: Moka's FHM/JM is like Jim Wendler's 5/3/1. Guys who lift should understand what i mean

I owe this guy a lot Every noob should grab a copy. Knowledge is power! On another note, if you're in need of high quality web stores for Stripe etc. I'm your #1 go-to guy.

Look at at AleksandrM, he is making huge profits from Stripe around 40k +, because he knows how to game their system. It's about having good CVV data to prevent chargebacks, having bulletproof websites and knowing which bank accounts to use, along knowledge and experience.All these components can be acquired here on evo. What cannot be acquired is experience. It is likely that you won't be successful the first few times, but you will gain experience and learn from your mistakes via trial and error. On an end note, The Four Horseman doesn't solely focus on Stripe, it's a guide about eCommerce fraud in general.There are a handful of other gateways that are easy to sign up for (apparently Wepay, Braintree and Worldpay) along hundreds of others that are a bit more difficult.Moka's guide will give you the greatest insight into eCommerce fraud generally. It's not about doing everything as he describes step by step this is not a tutorial. It's a foundation for getting into eCommerce fraud.

Evolution Forums,bongos,23569,2014-10-19T14:27:20,Re: â| The Four Horsemen 2nd ed.| ladron2 | Blackhat Business Intelligence,Guides Vendors,"Alright, so I purchased the guide a couple days ago and have been immersed in it since. Review First off, this guide is exactly that: a guide. This is not step-by-step instructions for anyone looking to have their hand held all the way through. Remember: a Sherpa does not climb the mountain for you, they simply show you the way.  Upon first reading this guide, I have to say I was a bit overwhelmed with all the infomation, tricks, and tools that I found within; it can seem like a lot if you're not already some pro-tier carder (and in that case you probably wouldn't need a guide), but don't worry. Everything in this guide is clearly outlined and if you're willing to put in the work, you'll most certainly profit from the methods this guide details. The information you'll find in this guide is what will separate you from the rest of the ""less-than-professional"" carders I'm sure you've all seen around the DW. The methods detailed inside are complex, yet simple to understand once you've got the basics of what you'll be doing. I don't want to give anything away, but this guide takes more than just a few dollars and some CVV data; this takes time (initially to set it up, anyway), investment, and the competency to manage yourself and your assets, because that's most certainly be what they become. If you're looking for a quick smash and grab to make 1k, then don't waste your time purchasing this guide. This isn't an instant get rich quick scheme; this is a get rich and stay rich method. If you're willing to spend the time and the money to set up an operation that's on par with those detailed in this guide, then I can without a doubt tell you that you'll more than make back your investment as long as you stick to what you learn here and use good common sense.  I known that at the time of writing this I'm not exactly some big name in the community but, if you've any doubt about procuring this guide, ponder no further; this is the tool you need to take yourself from a low-level/basic carder, to someone capable of much more. If you want to go from newb to pro instantly, then don't purchase this guide. If you want to take yourself to the professional-tier of carding, with the proper work, then I can't suggest anything other than obtaining this invaluable information as soon as you can.

Why take all the hassle to jump from ATM to ATM like a monkey and risked being filmed doing that /disclosing your location and cards with your DNA on it getting sucked by the machine. Better keep everything purely digital without incriminating physical evidence (like a stack of Debit cards) laying around.Just have washed Bitcoin to silently arrive in your electronic purse.Less risk + more time for you to enjoy your hard earned money.

The method i am using now for drops, just using BoA's is actually allot harder and longer for me since i am UK based all i have is coinbase to cashout really, and the orders get declined etc loads... but it's still easy money. Have much would you make at a usual 9-5 in a day here in the UK...Â£50-150, probably around the same in the states I can almost guarantee that 90% of people here didn't put in a days effort with their setups on stripe, they done the bare minimum.Take it slow, wait until 5th day to put through numerous transactions is what i do. Just make it look legit","oracle wrote:AleksandrM,as we know the success with stripe has been diminished, are you using different cashout methods or gateways?Cheers!O."

I purchased your guide a while back, and had received support from Prince_Oberyn back when he was acting as your customer service rep. Since then, I've accidentally disposed of the encrypted volume that I had your guide saved on, and I'd like to know if it's possible for you to send a replacement copy? As my order was more than 30 days ago, the sales record won't be present any longer, but I believe you may have the PM thread on the marketplace from a long while ago between myself and Prince, acting on MonkeyBusiness' account, which should show I was indeed a buyer.

A quick glance through, won't work.    Another source (BEST-SELLER) of good information which can be combined is ALPHA 02 (Carder Science Guide; Fourth Edition) for a more comprehensive background on e-commerce, as if you're a newbie to this, you then can have a more detailed understanding on how things are done. All in all, MOKA killed it, pristine material (AAA+++), all the way.   N.B: ....................................................ALPHA 02, is mentioned only for reference purposes (to help newbies gain further and more insight beyond the Four Horsemen), no disrespect meant to MOKA as reading both guides has given me a fresh approach and view towards ""CARDING"".....................................................  However, I would like to say; everyone bear with me right now, as I have been pondering on these questions stated below, so pardon my inquisitiveness. So, my questions are as follows;  With reference to 2) as given above. What can be done to make your web presence more legitimate in order to avoid being caught out by secret shoppers, if there happen to be any lurking around?   Also, what kind of webstore/e-commerce shop category (in terms of products or services being offered; i.e. clothes, electronics and what not) would be the most ideal or secure option, to prevent this from happening or being caught out?   Lastly, have we got any vendors selling ready made e-commerce shops on EVO or anyone elsewhere, that can setup one?   If not, I need some candid advice, on how to go about it myself.  Any TIPS or resources?

Evolution Forums,Prince_Oberyn,23569,2014-10-22T17:46:29,Re: â| The Four Horsemen 2nd ed.| ladron2 | Blackhat Business Intelligence,Guides Vendors,"I'd suggest Jungle Money to you. It was practically designed as the alternative to the Four Horseman. I'll quote an outtake on this topic from the upcoming MonkeyBusiness FAQ: ""What is the difference between The Four Horseman and Jungle Money? And which guide is more suitable for a beginner?The Four Horseman is the definitive guide to building, maintaining, cashing and scaling eCommerce fraud enviroments. While, Jungle Money is the alternative or ""lite version"" of it, ideal for people who don't want to work with eCommerce components and have better access to e-wallet services such as Paypal and Neteller rather than bank accounts.For the more advanced users, Jungle Money offers an optional eCommerce component, which allows users to merge the Four Horseman ecosystem with the Jungle Money ecosystem into one mega ecosystem resulting in a bigger payday. Both guides are aimed at intermediate users, but Jungle Money is the more accessible one of the two for anyone just starting out:a) the main ecosystem is build using Paypal accounts, which are cheaper and easier to obtain for most beginners rather than bank dropsb) the initial set up and day-to-day management of the Jungle Money ecosystem,  requires way less work compared to The Four Horsemanc) minimal eCommerce and carding knowledge is required (regarding the carding know-how read Chapter 3, Q1) Since, Jungle Money and The Four Horseman are aimed at intermediate users, what kind of knowledge do I have to acquire to get started?In order to get started with The Four Horseman you will require:1. Basic web adminstration knowledge including:a) Domain registration, hosting set up, SSL certificate acquisitionb) Cpanel navigation c) Wordpress set up and customizationd) Web design skills to make sites look proffessional (for payment gateways)e) Cron Jobs (for Ladron2)f) Bash commands (for Ladron2)2. Basic carding knowledge using CVVs 3. Basic security set up knowledge, (RDP/ VPS/ VPN) In order to make use of Jungle Money you will require:1. Paypal experience, the more the better, in particular knowledge of aging accounts(although tips are provided in Chapter 3 Q1 of this FAQ) 2. Some basic carding knowledge using CVVs (useful, but not necessary see Chapter 3, Q2)3. Basic security set up knowledge (RDP/ VPS/ VPN) What kind of ressources will I require to obtain?Your ecosystem can grow as large as you can manage. The larger you grow, the more resources you will need. Here is a general overview of the necessary components: For The 4 Horseman guide the components are:CVVs, fullz, bank drops, hosting, domains,  SSL certificates,  a drop (optional), RDP/ VPNs/ VPS and document scans.  For Jungle Money you will require the following:Paypal accounts, CVVs, scans, a drop (optional), a Google Voice account or burner phone, RDP/ VPN/ VPS  and document scans. How much money do I have to invest in the beginning? How long will it take me to make my money back?The start up costs to get you well prepared for the purchase of all necessary components are approximately:200$ - 300$ for Jungle Money500$ - 1000$ for The 4 HorsemanThe average duration for making your money back from The 4 Horseman is 10 - 14 days, if you're starting completely from scratch. With the Jungle Money guide you can make back the cost of the full guide back in just one or two transactions/ days. ""

Oh shit, I was certain his username was with a double F haha I will check again and then later update the FAQ.Now to your question: You know, generally it's hard to give these kind of estimates because Stripe is as unpredictable as Paypal.But what I have seen what the majority of The Four Horseman readers are pulling on average from a single Stripe account is 1000$ - 2000$ for beginners, approx. 3000$ - 5000$ k for intermediate users and up to 10,000+ for pro users. Perhaps you've seen that AleksandrM had a Stripe account with around 40,000$ inside. That's absolute pro ""moka"" level though. Better cashout success and overall numbers can be achieved with multiple accounts though. Always remember that your success depends on your effort, skills and especially good CVV data. Why good CVV data? Because it causes less chargebacks. The guide explains how to clean your CVV data, so you can get better results.  That's very nice to hear Andy, thank you! Yes, I've busted my ass and went through all 3 The Four Horseman and Jungle Money threads to determine which questions have been asked the most, the I've edited all of Moka's responses, added some of my own tips and illustrated the whole thing, because I didn't want to just publish it as a boring text file. All of this in just one week  Thank you so much, it's great to see that people appreciate the work Moka and I do on here. And yes Prince Oberyn is a badass motherfucker in Game of Thrones  Gad to hear you like the evolution Oberyn too haha

Evolution Forums,Prince_Oberyn,23569,2014-10-29T20:04:25,Re: â| The Four Horsemen 2nd ed.| ladron2 | Blackhat Business Intelligence,Guides Vendors,"The answer to your question is above Thrust. It depends on your CVV data.What does that mean? It means that if the CVVs you have purchased are high quality aka ""good known data"" as stated by Moka in the guide, you are very likely to not get a chargeback from them when performing a transaction. The more chargebacks you have, the more likely it is for Stripe to close your account.  I think it's a good approach to make small transactions that easily blend into the customers bills so they won't notice the fraudulent charge.  The guide will teach you how to clean your CVV data, so you receive little to no chargebacks at all. In order to clean your data we use Stripe amongst other things (I don't wanna give too much away in here). And during this cleaning process, the Stripe account that you're using for it, the bank drop and the website are going to get burned quickly, because our cleaning process will result in a high amount of chargebacks.But the cleaning process is indispensable to our operation, it is one of the things that make the guide great in my opinion. And while some may think that the loss of the Stripe account, bank drop and website are equally a loss of their investment, they don't look at the other side of the coin, meaning they don't realize that what they've gained is much more valuable = clean CVV data. This is also why Moka recommends the use of cheap prepaid cards that you can buy for 50 - 90$ each, for this process. It's better to burn an account that cost you 50 bucks than 200, no? --------  So yea, this is why there are people like AleksandrM who can reach 40k+ with a single Stripe account, while others have a hard time cashing out their 10 bucks. This is why we stress on the importance of good CVV data. -------- On another note though, cases like the 40k+ from AleksandrM are exceptions. Because he has a strong background in web administration, which gave him the upper hand from the very beginning. And this is why I'm releasing a free guide on web administration, scheduled for next Tuesday, it'll teach you the basics of setting up domains, hosting, ssl, certificates, wordpress, woocommerce and a few other things. I'll show you some of my tricks, I'll take you by the hand and give you a pretty good foundation on how to set up your environment. It isn't even difficult, it's really not, but so many have a hard time doing it, so i hope that this will help you in achieving your eCommerce fraud goals faster.

You guys have given us so much praise, it' incredible! And we're more than grateful for that. However, in my humble opinion, the best way to make a business even better, (which is my personal focus at the moment) is by encouraging you, the customer, to also give us some constructive criticism. Do let us know what lacks, what sucks, what you think we could do better and what you would like to see next. It would help us immensely. If you would like to contribute in this way, please contact MonkeyBusiness directly via the marketplace, where we can talk things through in detail. Alterntively, you can always through in some ideas here in the discussion thread, after all that's what it has been created for other than reviews.   What's Next 1) 99% of support requests have been answered today (and in general), I will go through 2 more PMs today and then:2) I'm finishing up the free administration handbook for you guys, that I unfortunately had to delay, due to the heavy workload and personal life shit. Since, I have now efficiently dealt with my personal crap, things will move even better and faster now.3) The continued production of my stores is scheduled for tomorrow and I already have two customers selected for that. That's all I can say for now on my web stores. It is currently just a part-time gig, but I hope I can eventually offer them to everyone. It's just difficult to deliver both, quality and quantity at the same time, while also having to run other money-making ventures. I'm sure you understand.4) By the end of November, The Money Business FAQ will be updated with more information, in particular questions regarding the AWS RDP set-up, as most people seem to have issues with that. I'll make this crystal clear to you. The Jungle Money section will be also extensively updated with more information.5) On an end note, keep the support requests coming, the average respond time is 24 - 48 hours. Don't worry about annoying me with your questions, it takes A LOT to actually break my patience and out of probably 100+ conversations it only happened once where I had to put someone into place. The most important thing, especially if you're a newbie, is to study the guides thoroughly, make yourself notes, a step by step to-do list and some heavy research via the evo forums, TCF and The MonkeyBusiness FAQ. If you still have questions after that, Moka and I will be here to give our best in making everything perfectly clear to you. _______________ Thanks everyone for your attention, support and feedback and apologies for the wall of text.

I also have been interested in WF and he gives a great method for that which is so simple, but effective. Now, the grand finale, the credit line w/ fullz.. as some moron in this thread mentioned the guide is poorly formatted and lacks detail.   First of all, most people in this line of business are not experts in english, they are foreigners or other people with not the best English.   Second, these jobs demand planning and strategy, which is the blueprint.   The blueprint is simple, it's all you need.   transcendpro put his ass on the line to learn all this shit and lives it - He made the blueprints - I have a feeling he really might be a millionaire soon  Happy to have gotten this at vouch price as the less people with this guide, the better.

Evolution Forums,iCards,53930,2015-03-05T06:51:25,Re: [GUIDE] Advanced How to Open Credit Lines + Square Cashout Bundle,Guides Vendors,"Looking over the method, i don't even need to make an attempt to try it. It will work, however I don't think it's worth the 3.3 Bitcoins. There are sections of the method were he just points you to purchase another guide of his to fill the blank in. For 1,000$ I think that blank should be filled in for me. I don't think I should require a further investment with you. If it's part of the method, and essential to be executed. It should be included, not sold as an expansion. Really what you're paying for here. Is how to get the card sent to your drop, and he teaches you. How to do that. The rest of it is really self explanatory. He will teach you a thing or two. You will end up with a high limit credit card, and you will cash-out. I just think 1,000$ is a little much once I take into account the format and grammar. It's easy to follow, but not as professional looking as some of the cheaper guides out there. With a little updating, and polishing. Sure, it could be well worth 1,000$. But it's missing some of the elements that make those high valued guides. While some of the elements are there, some of them are simply missing. 500$ would be more reasonable for this in it's current version.

It will work, however I don't think it's worth the 3.3 Bitcoins. There are sections of the method were he just points you to purchase another guide of his to fill the blank in. For 1,000$ I think that blank should be filled in for me. I don't think I should require a further investment with you. If it's part of the method, and essential to be executed. It should be included, not sold as an expansion. Really what you're paying for here. Is how to get the card sent to your drop, and he teaches you. How to do that. The rest of it is really self explanatory. He will teach you a thing or two. You will end up with a high limit credit card, and you will cash-out. I just think 1,000$ is a little much once I take into account the format and grammar. It's easy to follow, but not as professional looking as some of the cheaper guides out there. With a little updating, and polishing. Sure, it could be well worth 1,000$. But it's missing some of the elements that make those high valued guides. While some of the elements are there, some of them are simply missing. 500$ would be more reasonable for this in it's current version."

SPARTANZ is an awesome teacher. I was a newb for the most part in the world of carding. He explained simply all the terminology needed to understand and broke things down nicely in 3 sessions. 
Very cool person and will appreciate his future guidance and patience answering any questions. Well worth the value in the long run. Will be buying his antidetect software. Thanks again SPARTANZ.

Evolution Forums,SPARTANZ,50662,2015-02-19T02:01:35,:::HQ::: TOP CARDING LESSONS*** LIVE COACHING*** Price will raise soon,Guides Vendors,"âââHQ TOP Carding school OPENEDâââ ""All experience, information, knowledges used by professional carders in 1-1 personal coaching. A lot of private valuable information leaked, information which pro fraudsters don't want you to know. From a noob to a money making BEAST in a few days""   I would like to present one of the best carding lessons on the market right now. This is mainly for beginners, but i saw a lot of newbies who think they have enough carding knowledges even if this isnât true, so please keep reading to the end to see if this is for you. Carding doesnât work anymore like it used to work 10 years ago. Now, knowledges make the difference and only smart/informed people keep making money, others just spend them on scammers, shitty guides, bunch of cards they donât even know how to use. So if you are a beginner, Iâm sure you thought that you can just buy a CC for 5 $, go on Amazon, order 2 iphones, sell them for retail price to your friends, and keep the money. Iâm sorry to disappoint you, but you wonât make a million dollars after a couple of days. When we first discover carding, we all thought like this. And this is the reason why you see so many people getting scammed on Hidden Wiki and other similar sites, they are dreaming about easy/fast money without doing anything.  Carding is a very profitable activity. There are a lot of money involved, but this is not easy and it requires hard working, mainly learning. After getting knowledges and experience, money will come really easy, i would say very easy. There are people who spend even thousand of dollars before they manage to learn some things you will learn in first 15-20 minutes of our lessons. All HQ info which will be teached, come from hundred tests and experience of professional carders. In our world is all about time, so you can get this now, and begin making first money in a week, or you can spend hundreds/thousands and begin making them in one year. This is mainly stuff/physical items carding, not Paypal, Skrill, WU ( those can be thaught too, but i dont find them easy for beginners). So what will we learn? â Carding terminology. General things about carding â Three types of carding. Which type is better for you. From free pizza to high end Gucci clothes and Iphones worth thousands. â Card types. Everything about VBV and MSCS â Address Verification System. Billing and shipping address.  â E-gifts. How to get them and how to use them. â Why checking cards is killing your success. â ATO. How people are carding in a week items worth tens of thousands $ by taking control of credit card account â How shop's and bank's fraud systems are working. Why are you falling to card even with a CC which has 50k on it. â Security Bible. All you need to know about Socks 5, Virtual Machines, RDP's, VPN's, and other things. How to be a professional ghost and appear unique everytime. â Other stuff and answering your questions Price: 150 200 $ for standart package. 200 250 $ for standart+noob package How to see which package you must get: You need to buy standart+noob package if you don't have any knowledges in carding. If you never heard about VBV, VPN, don't know difference between a debit/credit card, don't know what is a BIN, and other things, this package is for you. First three buyers get this for 100 $. Price will rise gradually. And this isn't a sales trick, just my time and this info are worth much more. SO BUY IT NOW.  What else will you get? * All the students will get a discount for my Antidetect soft. For them, price is 75 $ * Free support after the courses * Discounts for my next intermediate and advanced tuts * I want to create a team of ambitious and smart people and maybe in future we can work on other projects together.  Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/91808  Avoid spending on shitty guides and unsuccessful tries and begin making money. It's time.

This course is for ordering physical items with help of virtual carding. No instore carding with dumps, or smth like this.  This is perfect for beginners and starting point to earn money and make progress. If a beginner will go to card Western Union (even intermediate carders can't sometimes), he will fail 10 times in row, and after will scream on forums that ""Carding is dead"".",

I've wasted over $200 on ""Beginner"" guides since 2014 to no effect! The reason is if you don't understand the very BASICS most guides here will be useless and most guides you find around are simply outdated and don't tell you anything advanced, the only way you can connect the dots in the guides you see around here if by having a friendly and flexible guy like SPARTANZ to teach you the essence of the game. I'm grateful and glad I've found this thread since many other live carding mentors are around $500 and for a third worlder like me that's weeks worth of hard work, this guy will give you a 1 on 1 session at the hour you choose, he will answer your questions and he will be there making sure you get it. I recommend this guy, honestly, best investment I've made.

I am more a tech guy, and know IT things, but some time ago i decided to begin fraud/carding. Not for money, but i just think this game is for smart people, and i like how sophisticated is carding and that you require creative approach to win in this game.  To be serious, Mr. SPARTANZ showed me how complex is all this, and for all my ""beginner"" questions, he had an answer. I didn't know many carding terms and i can't PM people or open threads everytime i have questions to ask something, especially when i dont receive answers. After 30 min, i already could say that i'm familiar with carding  Also, i liked tricks he showed me about VBV, and i wonder how people are inventing this, lol. Waiting for next session. For this one i had today, i can just say RESPECT my friend! P.S: I really wanted to get this for 100 $, missed chance, but if all sessions will be like today's one, i would be ready to pay even triple of 150 $ i paid.",

Wherever they may be a problem in getting what you want then, as clear as a flow chart, the vendor gives more clear instructions to get things back on track.  There is even e-paperwork if needed to give the victim a push in the right direction but I would hope it would not go that far.

I guess I'm not shocked that you don't know how Evolution works considering you only have 10 posts and you're trying to defame a trusted and respected vendor.

If you want to be more successful as a precursor to this message let them know of your company profits - I say revenue of between 3-5 million per year and 1-2 million profit.If they ask where you sell tell them ebay and your website, don't worry you don't need one. When they ask what site tell them you are a subsidiary of (Insert massive tech company here). This is in fact very successful.Ask them to include a PI (Pro forma Invoice) when they come grovelling back to you to take their sample order."

If anyone knows how these B2B sites work then you'll understand where I am coming from in all of this. Also this method was so saturated last year, people were running macros and bots to post messages to suppliers and now if you are lucky to get a sample you'll need to pay a crazy price i shipping but most of the time the samples are now free. See example of a reply below  Thanks so much for your kindly reply. What we mean by free sample is that we will refund the sample fee to you once you place a bulk order. Our sample price is USD10/pcs and the shipping cost is USD40 by DHL. So total cost for 1 sample is USD50 including shipping cost. We will refund the sample fe eto you once you place a bulk order. Hope to hear from you soon. Best regards! Sincerely,Cynthia Not trying to shit on anyone, just looking out for the community.

But let me get this straight: you think I ""manipulated"" all the people on the marketplace and forum to leave the feedback that they did? I guess I'm not shocked that you don't know how Evolution works considering you only have 10 posts and you're trying to defame a trusted and respected vendor. I do thank you for bringing more attention to my guide though! Like I said lets see some proof of the iPhone 6 you got and the sold on eBay. We are on a fucking internet forum full of people trying to make a quick buck, it's going to be easy to cut some deals with traders and also create multiple accounts and fool people. Your basically using SE on desperate people on this forum LOLOh and don't throw the 'low post count' crap at me I'm not trying to sell shit so it doesn't matter. It's people like you with this kiddie bullshit that is going to force people away from Evo.Method is below - add your own twist and try your luck but it was saturated and you won't get no iPhones LOLYou will be telling them you are a reseller of products.Basically you message as many Chinese sellers as you can find telling them you want to buy 5000-10000 pieces of their product, regardless of value, and wait for them to respond.They will respond with a stock message showcasing their crappy supply of items.Take your pick and tell them you would like to sample their product for quality control and company assurance policy. If you want to be more successful as a precursor to this message let them know of your company profits - I say revenue of between 3-5 million per year and 1-2 million profit.If they ask where you sell tell them ebay and your website, don't worry you don't need one. When they ask what site tell them you are a subsidiary of (Insert massive tech company here). This is in fact very successful.Ask them to include a PI (Pro forma Invoice) when they come grovelling back to you to take their sample order.You should be banned for even using the name your using if members here remember back to those day's of shadow crew.Never the less Evo is a good community and what gives you the right to come and flame what seem's to be a good system, people like you disgust me you retard.OP good luck with sales and cumbajohny get a grip and show some of your own methods and buy a vendor's account and sell it and get your own reviews but what you have just said and the attention you have given to this thread I'd be thanking you for keep bumping my thread with your bollox.BING"

This feedback will be updated as I in the progress of ordering a 320$ item with this guide right now.So the review:I received this guide 20 minutes ago. I started reading it and thought to myself how genius this guide was. For every possibility there is a solution here. I highly doubt a lot of vendors will not fall for this. Right now I am talking with a vendor and I'm almost finished, and he bought it. So, 20 minutes later, I have a 320 item, for free.This guide describes the possibility's, and the problems you might run into, along with the solution to these problems. I was actually so impressed with this guide, that  even though I got a vouch copy, I decided to buy it anyway.There really isn't a bad thing to say about this.

Wherever they may be a problem in getting what you want then, as clear as a flow chart, the vendor gives more clear instructions to get things back on track.  There is even e-paperwork if needed to give the victim a push in the right direction but I would hope it would not go that far.

No company is going to send free samples of iPhone6 plus 64GB.  Use your fucking common sense the whole entire method is about asking Chinese suppliers for free samples of products by bullshitting about being a wealthy business man interested in buying very large quantities. Most of these Chinese sellers don't sell legit iPhones they are cheap knock offs that run on Android. Also it's very hard to convince them for free samples with free shipping.  I did not buy this method from Diamond because I knew about it years ago, it's nothing new. I did ask him and others to send me it for free just to see if it was word for word the same thing but he refused so I know it's the same shit. I didn't want to start shit in this thread and I was going to release this method for free because it's not as easy as it's made out to be. Again I am going to say USE YOUR FUCKING COMMON SENSE PEOPLE!","Diamondzz wrote:mnbvcxz15 wrote:does this work for clothes sites? what is the chances of getting an iphone or other high value item for resaleThe chances are very high. Using this method I've already received an iPhone 6 Plus 64GB and sold it on eBay for a nice little profit. And yes, the sites this work for do sell clothing."

I will release the other part to it later.

What you described will result in complete failure and isn't even 1% of my guide LOL. But let me get this straight: you think I ""manipulated"" all the people on the marketplace and forum to leave the feedback that they did? I guess I'm not shocked that you don't know how Evolution works considering you only have 10 posts and you're trying to defame a trusted and respected vendor. I do thank you for bringing more attention to my guide though!

Evolution Forums,CumbaJohnny,41848,2015-01-18T01:16:40,Re: âEASY PROFITâ Get Anything You Want for FREE [NO DROP | NO CARDING],Guides Vendors,"Like I said lets see some proof of the iPhone 6 you got and the sold on eBay. We are on a fucking internet forum full of people trying to make a quick buck, it's going to be easy to cut some deals with traders and also create multiple accounts and fool people. Your basically using SE on desperate people on this forum LOL Oh and don't throw the 'low post count' crap at me I'm not trying to sell shit so it doesn't matter. It's people like you with this kiddie bullshit that is going to force people away from Evo. Method is below - add your own twist and try your luck but it was saturated and you won't get no iPhones LOL You will be telling them you are a reseller of products. Basically you message as many Chinese sellers as you can find telling them you want to buy 5000-10000 pieces of their product, regardless of value, and wait for them to respond. They will respond with a stock message showcasing their crappy supply of items. Take your pick and tell them you would like to sample their product for quality control and company assurance policy. If you want to be more successful as a precursor to this message let them know of your company profits - I say revenue of between 3-5 million per year and 1-2 million profit. If they ask where you sell tell them ebay and your website, don't worry you don't need one. When they ask what site tell them you are a subsidiary of (Insert massive tech company here). This is in fact very successful. Ask them to include a PI (Pro forma Invoice) when they come grovelling back to you to take their sample order.

No wonder you weren't able to SE anything, your method is disgusting. Still nice try to defame me though  Also, nobody on here makes ""deals"" to give positive reviews LOL. Maybe in your mind (as I said before, you have zero experience on Evo), but if a guide is a piece of shit it will be called out in a second.  You can keep trying to derail my thread, but from this point on I can't lower my IQ by replying to you. I hope you understand! When you buy the guide, go right ahead and post your feedback. Cheers",
