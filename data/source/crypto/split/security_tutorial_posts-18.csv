Maybe  now you'll finally wake up and listen.  Zaphod    ","Spy agencies target mobile phones, app stores to implant spywareUsers of millions of smartphones put at risk by certain mobile browser gaps, Snowden file showsBy Amber Hildebrandt and Dave Seglins, CBC News Posted: May 21, 2015 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: May 21, 2015 6:07 AM ET [photo of woman using smartphone]Caption: The Five Eyes spies found major security gaps in UC Browser while they were looking for larger app store vulnerabilities. They wanted to implant spyware on the smartphones of targets. Canada and its spying partners exploited weaknesses in one of the world's most popular mobile browsers and planned to hack into smartphones via links to Google and Samsung app stores, a top secret document obtained by CBC News shows.Electronic intelligence agencies began targeting UC Browser â a massively popular app in China and India with growing use in North America â in late 2011 after discovering it leaked revealing details about its half-billion users. Their goal, in tapping into UC Browser and also looking for larger app store vulnerabilities, was to collect data on suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets â and, in some cases, implant spyware on targeted smartphones.The 2012 document shows that the surveillance agencies exploited the weaknesses in certain mobile apps in pursuit of their national security interests, but it appears they didn't alert the companies or the public to these weaknesses. That potentially put millions of users in danger of their data being accessed by other governments' agencies, hackers or criminals. ""All of this is being done in the name of providing safety and yet ... Canadians or people around the world are put at risk,"" says the University of Ottawa's Michael Geist, one of Canada's foremost experts on internet law. CBC News analysed the top secret document in collaboration with U.S. news site The Intercept, a website that is devoted in part to reporting on the classified documents leaked by U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden. The so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance â the spy group comprising Canada, the U.S., Britain, Australia and New Zealand â specifically sought ways to find and hijack data links to servers used by Google and Samsung's mobile app stores, according to the document obtained by Snowden. [image]An illustration from the top-secret Five Eyes document shows a smartphone spilling all sorts of data that the spy agencies could take advantage of. Over the course of several workshops held in Canada and Australia in late 2011 and early 2012, a joint Five Eyes tradecraft team tried to find ways to implant spyware on smartphones by intercepting the transmissions sent when downloading or updating apps. Privy to huge amounts of dataThe Five Eyes alliance targeted servers where smartphones get directed whenever users download or update an app from Google and Samsung stores.

Making that connection was a much desired goal of the agencies because of the growing use of smartphones and the wealth of data they contain.Respecting agreements not to spy on each others' citizens, the spying partners focused their attention on servers in non-Five Eyes countries, the document suggests.

It's human nature for anyone to want something quicker with less hassle however when it comes to illegal matters where there are potential lengthy consequences for anyone caught, arrested and convicted, you should put the time and effort into your OPSEC to ensure you've given yourself every opportunity to remain free should shit hit the fan one day, unexpectedly.

","New Zealand's internet connection to the United States has survived a cable cut in Oregon on the US west coast.Southern Cross Cable Network confirmed a segment of its cable network was cut at about 1am New Zealand time when a contractor working for the state's transport department in the town of Klamath Falls cut through it with a digger.Spokeswoman Rosemay Foot said the cable was repaired in a little under nine hours.Southern Cross' network is configured as a ""figure of eight"" centred on Hawaii. The design means there is always one back-up route if a section of the cable is cut.The land-based ""E2"" segment of the cable that runs between Oregon and San Jose that was cut has an addition terrestrial back-up. But Foot said its ""first choice"" was to instead switch circuits across its international links.Traffic that would usually run between the US and Australia was diverted via New Zealand.    Foot said New Zealand customers of Southern Cross had not been affected by the cable cut and nor had other customers who had paid for capacity via a back-up route.However, the outage had some impact on customers outside New Zealand who had not paid for ""protected circuits"", she said.  Southern Cross Cable Network confirmed the incident several hours after it was first approached by Stuff for comment. Foot said it advised customers of the cable cut within 15 minutes ""but does not make public releases about operational issues"".""We reiterate there was no loss of service to any protected services and there was no impact to any New Zealand originating or terminating service,"" she said.Foot revealed there had been another cut on the same link in February when a boring machine cut through its fibre-optic cable near Sacramento.Several attempts have been made to build a business case for an additional fibre-optic cable that would link New Zealand to the US and reduce the country's reliance on Southern Cross.Hawaiki Cable secured a carrier licence in April from Communications Minister Amy Adams for its proposed subsea cable that would run between Sydney, Whangarei and Oregon.However, it has yet to confirm it has secured the US$300 million ($410m) in funding that it needs to begin construction.Foot said the significant advantage of Southern Cross was that it was a ""dual cable network"". - Stuff (source: http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/68739063/southern-cross-confirms-cable-cut)(and how perfect is it that there was a boring machine in Sacramento, so boring it severed an international telecommunications conduit? nevermind, i'm just tired and punchy. sorry Sacramento, you nilla wafer of a town.);âI can tell you quite categorically there is no facility by the NSA, the GCSB or anyone else on the Southern Cross cable network.âLetâs be quite blunt.

The problem? The Soviet Navy had completely blocked foreign ships from entering the region.Not to be deterred, the National Security Agency launched Operation Ivy Bells, deploying fast-attack submarines and combat divers to drop waterproof recording pods on the lines. Every few weeks, the divers would return to gather the tapes and deliver them to the NSA, which would then binge-listen to their juicy disclosures.The project ended in 1981, when NSA employee Ronald Pelton sold information about the program to the KGB for $35,000. He's still serving his life prison term. Source: http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/the-creepy-long-standing-practice-of-undersea-cable-tapping/277855/ "

Not coincidentally, many providers have rapidly implemented egress filtering over the past year.  Only real defense short-term is to try to filter the attacks out upstream.. since they're all coming from legitimate AS's all over the place, you can't really filter them out based on anything other than destination/port.

The origional creator and seller some of you may remember was xVisceral, which has turned to provide assistance to the GVT.  I didn't think they would be going after users, but several sources say this to be so, from the articles themselves to a YT video titled  ""Don't Buy BlackShades""  Here are the news snippits:  Don't know how to quote so here goes:  ""More than 100 people worldwide have been arrested following an FBI-led crackdown on hackers linked to a ""remote administration tool"" called Blackshades.  Raids took place in more than a dozen countries, according to officials who spoke to Time magazine, and involved law enforcement agencies in Europe, Asia, Australia and North America. According to the UK's National Crime Agency, 17 of those arrested were based in Britain.  The charges are still sealed, but US prosectors are expected to announce some of the results at a press conference midday in New York.  Known as a RAT or backdoor, Blackshades and other software like it allows attackers to remotely seize control of a users' computer, turning on webcams, stealing passwords and personal information, and launching further attacks on other computers. The software itself is not illegal, and can be bought for as little as $40, but installing it on a victim's computer without their knowledge is against the law in most countries.  In 2012, an FBI sting resulted in the arrest of more than 20 people involved with the programme, including Michael Hogue, allegedly the software's lead coder under the name xVisceral. Despite the arrest, researchers from Symantec saw a rise in infections over the second half of 2013.  Troy Gill, senior security analyst at AppRiver, thinks that these arrests are linked to Hogue's. ""Even though these busts have come a little later than might be expected,"" he says, ""it is not inconceivable to think that information or access gleaned in the author's arrest could have been instrumental in facilitating this coordinated effort.""""  &  ""Police have arrested around 100 people in global raids against a notorious malware being sold complete with ""ransom notes"" to extort money after taking control of computers.  ""During the course of a worldwide investigation, creators, sellers and users of BlackShades malware were targeted by judicial and law enforcement authorities in 16 different countries,"" Europe-wide police and justice bodies Europol and Eurojust said in a statement.""  &   "" Law enforcement identified two co-creators of Blackshades as Alex Yucel and Michael Hogue. Hogue was arrested in Arizona in 2012, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with law enforcement, officials said. Yucel was arrested in Moldova in 2013 and the U.S. is awaiting extradition.  ""Working in close coordination with our partners, we conducted a series of arrests and other actions targeting the creators and purveyors of malicious computer software known as Blackshades, which can victimize ordinary Americans by stealing and exploiting their personal information,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said today. ""We are stepping up our cyber enforcement efforts around the globe. We will simply not tolerate these activities."" ""   This, in hand with news that the FBI, GCHQ, NSA are stepping up their darknet shakedown and surveilience, is causing me to worry a great deal.  Thoughts?",""

No more rants about agorism and anarchy when you're looking at 20 in prison. To me, this is reminiscent of Galileo being forced to recant his assertions about earth's orbit in order to avoid being boiled alive or whatever the Vatican had planned for him.  From Bloomberg Business:  ","The man convicted of running the Silk Road online drug marketplace as the Dread Pirate Roberts asked a judge to spare him from life in prison, calling the website a ânaÃ¯ve and costly ideaâ that has ruined his life.Ross Ulbricht, 31, expressed regret in a letter to the Manhattan federal judge who will sentence him May 29. Ulbricht faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life.âSilk Road was supposed to be about giving people the freedom to make their own choices, to pursue their own happiness, however they individually saw fit,â Ulbricht told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in the two-page letter Friday. âWhat it turned into was, in part, a convenient way for people to satisfy their drug addictions.âA jury found Ulbricht guilty in February of all seven criminal charges against him, including conspiracy and trafficking drugs on the Internet.Ulbricht claimed in his trial that he started the site, where users could buy an array of illegal drugs and computer hacking tools anonymously, paying in bitcoins, as an âeconomic experiment.â He said he passed control of the site to someone else after a few months. Ulbrichtâs lawyer said he will appeal.Ulbrichtâs online name was taken from a character in the 1987 film âThe Princess Bride,â prosecutors said.âIn creating Silk Road, I ruined my life and destroyed my future,â Ulbricht, who has a bachelorâs degree in physics and a masterâs in material sciences, told Forrest. âI could have done so much more with my life. I see that now, but it is too late.âUlbricht, who has been in U.S. custody since his arrest in October 2013, asked Forrest to give him a sentence that will leave him âa light at the end of the tunnel.ââEven now I understand what a terrible mistake I made,â he said. âIâve had my youth, and I know you must take away my middle years, but please leave me my old age.âThe case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 14-cr-00068, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan)."

Its hard to say what his motivations were.  The fact that he was babbling and apologetic in front of a judge doesn't really tell us anything. The dude's facing life in prison. It doesn't mean that he changed his libertarian position. He's just looking for mercy.  In my opinion, we need a market that is both competent and ran by someone who isn't in it for the quick coins. His heart was originally in the right place, but he wasn't mentally prepared for the position he put himself in. You can tell from the IRC chats that he was just in too deep.

She would doubtless interpret such a denial as not taking responsibility for and/or not expressing remorse or contrition for his actions. Likely such an assertion would only backfire, and harden the judge's position, instead of causing her to look more favorably upon him. I think that the little lightbulb has finally come on, and he has, at long last, realized the hopelessness of his position. Even he has been forced to realize that his appeals are doomed to failure. For several years now, he has been living in a fantasy world, and reality has finally broken through to him, and hit him in the face. Zaphod"

The implications of parallel construction are terrifying.;""Held: A jury's verdict of acquittal does not prevent a sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.... In addition, acquittal merely proves, not that the defendant is innocent, but the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

But whereas -- after an injunction had been judicially intimated to me by this Holy Office, to the effect that I must altogether abandon the false opinion that the sun is the center of the world and immovable, and that the earth is not the center of the world, and moves, and that I must not hold, defend, or teach in any way whatsoever, verbally or in writing, the said false doctrine, and after it had been notified to me that the said doctrine was contrary to Holy Scripture -- I wrote and printed a book in which I discuss this new doctrine already condemned, and adduce arguments of great cogency in its favor, without presenting any solution of these, and for this reason I have been pronounced by the Holy Office to be vehemently suspected of heresy, that is to say, of having held and believed that the Sun is the center of the world and immovable, and that the earth is not the center and moves: Therefore, desiring to remove from the minds of your Eminences, and of all faithful Christians, this vehement suspicion, justly conceived against me, with sincere heart and unfeigned faith I abjure, curse, and detest the aforesaid errors and heresies, and generally every other error, heresy,  and sect whatsoever contrary to the said Holy Church, and I swear that in the future I will never again say or assert, verbally or in writing, anything that might furnish occasion for a similar suspicion regarding me; but that should I know any heretic, or person suspected of heresy, I will denounce him to this Holy Office, or to the Inquisitor or Ordinary of the place where I may be. Further, I swear and promise to fulfill and observe in their integrity all penances that have been, or that shall be, imposed upon me by this Holy Office. And, in the event of my contravening, (which God forbid) any of these my promises and oaths, I submit myself to all the pains and penalties imposed and promulgated in the sacred canons and other constitutions, general and particular, against such delinquents. So help me God, and these His Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hands. I, the said Galileo Galilei, have abjured, sworn, promised, and bound myself as above; and in witness of the truth thereof I have with my own hand subscribed the present document of my abjuration, and recited it word for word at Rome, in the Convent of Minerva, this twenty-second day of June, 1633. I, Galileo Galilei, have abjured as above with my own hand."

Perhaps someone more knowledgeable may be able to correct me, but the current problem is that attempting to alter the HTTP headers won't work if websites use javascript to fingerprint the browser with e.g navigator.userAgent. A spoofed HTTP user agent with a different javascript response would be even more identifying. Also, if I remember correctly, each browser sends the User Agent data in a different manner, which might also be a giveaway regardless of any spoofing attempt.  Disabling javascript on your browser entirely is impractical because oftentimes it'll just break the website. However, I have this idea that if you pass your traffic through a transparent squid proxy you could alter the browser fingerprint response you send to a website. You could have a collection of say, the 100 most common fingerprints and have the proxy select them randomly at the same frequency with which they occur in the real world. The only property you wouldn't want to mess with is monitor size.  I would love to try to work on this but I have little idea about how to set up a squid proxy that supports SSL or Tor.  In many regards it'd be the functional equivalent of an effective MITM attack.

"The Hub Forums","Boogie","3089.0","2014-05-01T20:20:59","PSA: Using Your Street Smarts on the Deep Web *Update: 2nd part added*","General Discussion/Security"," During my years on TOR, I have seen countless scam attempts and many sad faces of those who were ripped off. Let's face it. Here in the deep web, scammers will always exist, plain and simple. no matter how hard we all try to bust them down, their presence will always remain. You will find them on forums, their own websites, and throughout all major and established dark markets. Now that we all have accepted this sad issue, let's discuss the many methods to help prevent you from falling into this trap.  First and foremost, the number one rule when doing business on the deep web is to always trust your instinct. I'm sure all of you heard this old saying before: if it's too good to be true, it probably is. I know it's very cliche, but it still holds a lot of merit. Most scam victims fail to follow this quote and go with their impulses instead. They see a product or deal at a astounding price, that they don't think of anything else but having the items in their hands. It's like being hypnotized in a sense. Don't worry, I'm not talking down on anyone. It's human nature to follow with impulses. Just remember that next time you see an amazing deal, think it through and see if this can be realistic.  Now that we covered the golden rule. I'm now going to discuss the different types of scam methods that are present thought the deep web. Please post if I left anything out or if you have any questions or comments.  The Hidden Wiki (THW)  THW is probably one of the oldest sites still in existance on TOR. It is more then likely one of the first sites many people new to TOR visit. It can be quite an amazing discovery seeing all the differnt businesses selling drugs, weapons, fraud items, stolen electronics, etc. For a lack of words, it's really awesome to see that you now have access to pretty much anything you want when you didn't prior to setting up TOR.  Now the problem here is that THW can be moderated by pretty much anyone who has registered an account. Some of the nefarious Hidden Wiki staff are very aware of the many new comers to th deep web. This is why it is safe to that just about every commercial site on THW are scams. Plan and simple. Even legitimate and well known markets featured on THW are more then likely phishing sites set up to steal your account information.  Long story short, AVOID the hidden wiki when searching for market links.  Example of Phishing site for SR 2.0 (DO NOT LOGIN!): http://e5wvymnx6bx5euvy.onion/ -best way to tell is that the URL is obviously the wrong one.  If you need a link to a market site, visit the subreddit DarkNetMarkets (http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/) or the Deep Dot Web (http://www.deepdotweb.com/). These sites provide legitimate market links that are never altered. If anyone knows of any other sites new comers can use to find legit links, please toss them up.  Non-Market Commercial Sites  Just like the ones listed on THW, pretty much all of the small sites that sell products and services are all pretty much scams. The only exception are sites that operated by established market vendors who are well-recognized and can be verified with their PGP. If anyone needs help verifying someones PGP, you are more then welcome to message me and I'll be glad to help. Plus, there are a few sites that catalog vendor PGPs and offer verification as well. I'll show you some examples of sites and how to tell the are rippers.  Green Notes Counter: http://67yjqewxrd2ewbtp.onion/  Here is a site that sells counterfeit coins. Sadly they do not accept escrow and give the typical scammer reason that they do not trust escrow sites. But for some ill-logic reason, it's okay to trust them. Lol -yeah right.  Double Your BTC: http://jmkxdr4djc3cpsei.onion/  Here is a site that ""promises"" to return to you the double amount of BTC you send them. Let's think about this, who on earth will give you free money? No one that's who. If they have such a wonderful method on doubling bitcoin, then why would they share it and not just keep it themselves to get rich? Well, actually they do have a method for getting rich, it's by stealing others coin.  Carder's Paradise: http://cardsv4kovqmjr37.onion/  Oh wow! a site that sells cloned debit cards with a pin# so that you can just easily walk to any ATM and cash it out. Just like with the double your btc service, who in their right mind would give away free money? Why couldn't they just keep the cards and cash them out themselves? These are the question you have to ask and the true simple answer is that they don't have any cards. They just want your coin and bolt.  People's Drug Store: http://newpdsuslmzqazvr.onion/  Just another rip-off site that offers no escrow protection and just wants steal from you. same with the other mentioned sites, they state that once payment is received, they will mail you the shipping information. I hate to say it but you will be waiting a long time for that info. IMPORTANT: Keep and eye out with other sites using the same format. They are hosted by a pseudo-organization called TorShops. Avoid all of their sites at all costs!  iPhones for 50%: http://iphoneavzhwkqmap.onion/  I'm just gonna say it, all of these electronic stores are scams. Never have I seen a legit ones. Either they feed you a line of shit on why they don't escrow and there are ones that offer a fake ""escrow"" service. The sites with ""escrow accepted"" will usually send you a link to a site you probably never heard of and ask you do depoist money and simply release it when you get your item. Sadly, the electronic site most likely owns that escrow site and will just take the btc and avoid your emails.  I won't go into a lot of detail but the self-operated sites that sell guns and offer hitman services. They are all scams plain and simple. The solution is to just stick to the established markets and use their escrow system. Remember, escrow is the main line of defense that protects you from losing your coin. Always use it.  Scammers on Commercial Markets  This section will cover how to spot and deal with rippers that use established markets to host their scam. Some of them demand FE on everything, others will appear to have outstanding feedback, and there are even some that offer escrow too. Crazy, I know. So here are the ways to spot them and some tactics they use to steal your coins.  The first and easy ones to spot are the brand new vendors to a site with no reputation and off the bat request FE. They either sell a great variety of different products (red flag) at great price hoping to grab as many customers as possible. Or, they have a few big and expensive products and wait until someone takes the bait. when you spot these people, question them on why they don't accept escrow. The most common replies scammers give are ""they don't trust escrow"" or ""BTC is too unpredictable"". Whatever excuse they give you, just walk away. I know, that's a killer deal they offer, but wouldn't you rather be at peace of mind? There are plenty of legit vendors that accept escrow. Don't risk it and go with them. I forgot to mention, always check their feedback and the forums to find any reviews the vendor may have. This will give you better assurance whether or not to deal with the vendor.  A lot of the time. you will find scammers with amazing feedback. How could this be? Well, they use the tactic called feedback stacking. This is when a scammer registers numerous buyer accounts and buy from themselves and leave amazing feedback. Here is what to look for when spotting padded feedback: numerous complete orders on the same day, price is extremely low or item was deleted, same username or same comments are used over and over again.  Example: if you have Pandora, login and check out this seller's profile (Note: this is not an attack on Pandora, it was just an example I found. These are found on every market. Sorry Pandora)  http://pandorajodqp5zrr.onion/profile/c9b9f96216d1eb17ab9b88348bbb5d05  Scroll all the way down and look at the feedback (long way down. seller's way of hiding it). Loot at that. This is probably the most obvious padded feedback ever seen. Some are more clever then that, but they always slip up by showing a pattern. You'll notice it when you come across it.  When you order from a vendor and the item is in escrow, make sure you note the shipping time. A lot of rippers will set a short shipping time hoping that you won't notice so that the order will auto-finalize. Just remember when funds are released whether after FE'ing or the order auto-finalized, the first thing that vendor will do is quickly withdraw the coin to their wallet. It is now out of the staff's hands to recover your money.  One final note, be careful when posting in the wanted or buyer request section of a market's forum. This is where a lot of rip offs occur. You may get plenty of PMs from people who aren't even a vendor saying they can help you out. Just remember to tell them HELL NO and wait for a verified vendor to reply. Because you know what's gonna if you decide to follow through with that PM offer.  Well this is what I got so far. Pretty long-winded I know. Please feel free to ask question or toss in any extra info I forgot to discuss. Stay safe out there everyone and remember that golden rule: if it's too good to be true, it probably is =) ",""

"The Hub Forums","Boogie","3089.0","2014-05-04T22:46:47","PSA: Using Your Street Smarts on the Deep Web *Update: 2nd part added*","General Discussion/Security"," Part 2: Vendor Protection against Scam Attempts   Being a vendor myself, I can fully understand and sympathize for all the hard work and business management they must go through. Albeit these instances are less common, they still do happen and pretty much any vendor whose been in the game long is more than likely to have any of the following occur.    Buyer disputes order stating that it is not what they expected or item did not arrive even though it did  As I stated, there are far more awesome and honest buyers than bad apples. But sadly, it does happen mainly with either low life's, or kids thinking they can pull a fast one. I cannot stress this enough, when creating a new listing be sure to give as much detail as possible. This will prevent any confusion and if a dispute occurs, you can refer the buyer and staff telling them that sold product is in accordance with the description. Plus, when you have 50 customers before them saying they were satisfied with the item received, you will have much higher chances winning a dispute.  When a buyer claim the package is a no-show, make sure you do either of the following to prevent this. Place tracking on all of your items that you ship. For security, try not to give it out unless it is necessary. This is great proof to show staff that you did indeed ship out the item. If you do not use tracking, make sure it is known in your profile that this is the case and you cannot give refunds on lost packages. It would be to the buyers discretion whether or not to order.    Buyer Threatens to Leave Negative Feedback Unless Given a Refund  I've actually had this happen to me. This was a plain and simple case that he was looking for free stuff and wanted to be an ass and go this route. It really frustrated me because I was very nice and polite to the dude and he decided to pull this shit on me. Well, I handled it in a professional manner and backed off. This is what I did and what you can do too in this situation. I basically called his bluff. I explained to him that I have 40+ customers before him (which is true) buy the same product and every single one of them was completely satisfied. Given that information, I told him that I wasn't going to give him a refund, and to go ahead and leave the negative feedback if you wish.   If he had left the negative feedback, I would've retorted that this customer was just a troll looking for free stuff, and given my positive track record with this item I did not feel a refund with in order. He never did leave the feedback and released the escrow, which I'm happy   Also, depending on your market, staff will remove negative feedback if it was unjustified. Just report to staff and see what they say.  I actually know a vendor who was in the same situation. He actually refunded the buyer and the asshole buyer still left negative feedback. Man, did that vendor throw a fit. Thankfully the staff took care of it.    Competitor Attacks  Occasionally, who will have a unethical and disgruntled vendor that is jealous of your booming business and wants to do something to sabotage it. A lot of the times they will make multiple buyer accounts, buy the cheapest product you sell, and then turn around and either call you a scammer or the product and service was bad. If you are a victim of this, report it to the staff and your customers as soon as possible. Let them all know about the situation and given your track record, they will be understanding. Most customers can determine if you have either a troll or competitor attacking you and will not think bad of you with the given false feedback. Often staff will recognize the attack and ban the shill accounts and remove the feedback. It's sad to see vendors sink that low to do such an attack.    Trolls/Disgruntled customers  Often times you will come across these when when discussing products and prices about your product. What generally happens is that you'll get a buyer that is not happy with your price and then offers some low-ball figure, or you can have buyers that want a freebie tossed their way. You tell them no and the price stands as is. Most are understanding of this, while you do have some that act like children and throw a temper tantrum because they cannot get their way. They end up going to the forums and posting false statements calling you a scammer and that your service is terrible, blah, blah, blah. To handle this, just politely and professionally explain the situation that you never even done business with this clown and how on earth could you be a scammer when no coin was exchanged? Also explain that their behavior is ridiculous and just wanted something cheap or free. Then everybody will realize what an ass this buyer just made of themselves and will easily join your side on this situation.  Well that's all I have for right now. If any vendor would like to add on and share any of their experiences, I would love to hear them. Thanks for reading and stay safe everybody        ",""

There are directions on the site that explain how to do this, and you can simply copy/paste the commands and replace the <iso goes here> with the .iso by compy/pasting it to the command line when it asks for its directory. For me it simply would not install this way and it was because I was missing a command that was not in the instructions. Something retarded like ~dev at the end of a certain command. After about 5 hours of trying I figured this out and got it to successfully install.  Next you need a bootloader because mac has an EFI loader instead.

If you can see it on your desktop, you canât use it the way we need to. $ diskutil list You should see something like this:  /dev/disk0    #:      TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme       *251.0 GB   disk0    1:      EFI                          209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:      Apple_CoreStorage            249.8 GB   disk0s2    3:      Apple_Boot Recovery HD       814.4 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:      TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      Apple_HFS Macintosh HD      *249.5 GB   disk1 /dev/disk2    #:      TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme       *1.0 TB     disk2    1:      EFI                          209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:      Apple_HFS My Passport        999.8 GB   disk2s2 /dev/disk3    #:      TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      FDisk_partition_scheme      *1.0 GB     disk3    1:      DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED          1.0 GB     disk3s1  In the instance above, Iâve noted my thumbdrive â /dev/disk3. It happened to be âUNTITLEDâ, but it could be whatever name you may have given it. Anyhow, we essentially need to unmount everything on that disk, but not remove it completely from the system.  $ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3 Unmount of all volumes on disk3 was successful  That solves that. Now, where is that ISO image you have? You need to know where it is so you can copy it to that thumbdrive. By the way â do this on a thumbdrive that is either backed up, or in other ways not useful (like old, and small, whatever). Youâll note the one Iâm using is 1G. LOL! I got it with a Cisco router that I bought. It came with âmanagementâ software on it that sucks. But I digress. That thumbdrive, when itâs all over, will have NOTHING on it but the ISO youâre âburningâ to it. On to the destructive partâ¦  $ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/crunchbang-11-20130506-i486.iso of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=128k 6168+0 records in 6168+0 records out 808452096 bytes transferred in 186.954879 secs (4324317 bytes/sec)  I should note â you wonât see any activity (more on that in a second). You hit [Return] and the computer goes to work, not telling if itâs working or not. dd is one of those classic commands â it ainât fancy, or pretty, or all high-falutinâ. It does one thing, and it does exactly what you told it to do, or it errors. I should also note â if you screw up an point that to something important, like, in my disk list above, disk0? Well, youâll have the joy of reinstalling the OS on your Mac, most likely.  Breakdown:â¨sudo â most of you know what this is. I hope. It allows you to do things as the âsuperuserâ on your Mac (i.e., superuser do).â¨dd â command to convert and copy a file (I donât know why itâs named that).â¨if=<filename> â input fileâ¨of=<filename> â output fileâ¨bs=n â block sizeâ¦ You can use 1m, 1k, 128k â you get the idea. I like 128k, thereâs not much speed gained by anything bigger. Some of you are looking at that output file location and thinking âWhere in the heck did he get rdisk3 from??â Wellâ¦ Itâs the same location as disk3, only itâs a ârawâ device connection. Weâre stepping outside the rules a little bit â taking a little known shortcut that doesnât have any stoplights, if you will. Or speed limits. Youâll essentially move the same data in about 1/6th of the time if you /dev/rdisk[n] The last thing that you should do is eject it â but how do you do that, since you canât drag it to the trash? diskutil still has you covered.  $ diskutil eject disk3 Disk disk3 ejected  If you really need to âseeâ something, youâll need to have (or install) Pipe Viewer. Unless you already have some system like MacPorts or HomeBrew, have it working, and know how to use it, just suck it up and deal with not seeing something. Really. I mean it. Anyhow, maybe youâre a dork like me, and you have Pipe Viewer. Instead of the dd command we used initially, weâre going to modify it.  $ pv -petr ~/Desktop/crunchbang-11-20130506-i486.iso | sudo dd of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=128k 0:00:33 [4.11MiB/s] [========>                                      ] 17% ETA 0:02:40  There you go. A nice little visual guide for elapsed time, how fast, and an estimate for how long itâs going to take. If you want to know more about Pipe Viewer, thereâs a great article on it here. Well. This turned out longer than I expected. Anyhow, I hope it helps one of you out there. Someday. Maybe.      PM me if you need q's answered    What mac do you have? An older macbookpro?",""

Skimmers and hackers steal numbers, and they sell them on the markets. When you hear on the news that Target or whoever got breached, the markets are where their shit gets sold.What's difficult to find is ACTUAL plastic. There have been vendors that make/clone the actual cards (see http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/13/spanin-onymous-deepweb-counterfeit-notes-seller-arrested/).

I have been hired by Albert to help him with TBA.  Trying to think of what to say.. Most everything has already been said!  The three main questions asked when a new market arises are: 1) How do I know my coins are safe?  Yes the market has the same look as other not so legitimate and/or flawed markets have had in the past. This is because the frontend is Bitwasp code (open source). However, this does not hinder security. All the background code is written by Albert. And as Albert mentioned, all processes involving the movement of coins are verified manually and values are checked against the history of deposits, withdraws and transactions. So no one can create false values and withdraw. The coins are stored offline with seeded watch only wallets. So no one can steal coins. Also, the market is hosted on Alberts own servers. I don't really know how better security could be set up    2) How can we trust YOU to not run off with out coins?  Well, with any market, or any person for that matter, you can never be too sure. I don't suggest putting blind faith in any marketplace, but I can say this:  Albert is not new to Tor. He has been hosting tor shops for a few years, and has built a reputation. He may not be the most well known guy on tor, But at least he is known.. and known for being a nice guy    3) Why should I chose your market over all the other markets?  To answer that.. Pleas see the answers to questions 1 and 2! Lol  Also, as mentioned above, This market treats quality vendors with care and is made to be a good home for them. The focus is quality and security and the whole market is tailored to those two things.   So please come give TBA a try! We still need vendors.. So don't be afraid to sign up and get some sales!

When I poked around, and tried to verify the Queen of Cards' hushmail.com address, I got a response from the server that the account was deactivated; normally, when dealing the Hush accounts, the server would respond that the account had expired (if it was a free account). Interestingly, the hushmail account of her ostensible associate still appears to be active. My recollection is that users cannot delete their own account, but must request account deletion by Hush staff, so it is rather unlikely that she nuked the account herself. I'd wager that it was nuked by Hush staff for violation of their TOS.

Skimmers and hackers steal numbers, and they sell them on the markets. When you hear on the news that Target or whoever got breached, the markets are where their shit gets sold.  What's difficult to find is ACTUAL plastic. There have been vendors that make/clone the actual cards (see http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/13/spanin-onymous-deepweb-counterfeit-notes-seller-arrested/). But finding one today probably isn't going to happen unless you spend a lot of time in the carding scene.  For me personally, buying someone's credit card number is like stealing from your grandma.

"The Hub Forums","grimforecast","7469.0","2015-03-22T16:21:54","thoughts on pgp","General Discussion/Security","wanted to take a few minutes to remind everyone what pgp does and does not guarantee you in this environment.   Signing - since nobody signs messages, you are never sure who sent them: everyone here is afraid to sign messages using pgp, because that may act as cryptographic proof that they are the author. the core issue is called ""non-repudiation"", and it means that you can't deny sending it or disavow its contents.    Lack of signing - When you get a pgp encrypted pm, you are usually getting it encrypted to your public key, but not signed by the sender. this means that the author is not guaranteed to be whoever sent the pm. if a forum / mail provider /etc is compromised, you cannot trust the sender. for instance, if Alfred were to suddenly turn evil, he could send me a PM from MyOldFriend, encrypted to my public key. i would think that the message came from MyOldFriend.   since everyone hates signing things, the only way to be reasonably sure you are talking to who you think you are is to make sure you respond to them using their pgp public key. and you have to know you have the right public key for that person. and preferably include a reference or quote from something they said in the last message, so they have a chance to realize that somebody is in the middle. otherwise, evil forum admin could see that MyOldFriend sent me an encrypted message, and immediately respond to MyOldFriend with a fake message from me, just encrypted to their public key and unsigned  pgp also has lots of metadata in it, including the specific keyids the message is encrypted to, unless you are using the --throw-keyids option. this helps the gpg client figure out which secret key to use when people decrypt it. when people use the --throw-keyids option, your client has to try every secret key it has by brute force to find the right one to decrypt the message.  but without --throw-keyids, anybody watching the transport method (like this forum, some random tor mail provider, etc) can see exactly what keys are being used. so if I used to be known as EvilMotherfucker, and had a PGP key with a keyid of 55BC8888 back then, and I signed up here as grimforecast, then an old friend sent me a message encrypted to keyid 55BC8888, what could somebody monitoring this forum learn? they could make a pretty good guess that grimforecast=EvilMotherfucker   Paranoid PGP Use for the truly paranoid, here is how you have a reasonably secure conversation with someone you know: 1. you have to be  certain that you are really talking to your friend without someone in the middle. maybe they sign something to prove their identity. they could also just clearsign something, like a hashed value so they could prove to you that they are who you think. Whatever they sign, it should NOT specify what new identity they are using or will be using, since that just ties the two together in a way that isn't needed. they just have to prove to you that they are who you think. 2. you create a new GPG key, ONLY FOR USE WHEN TALKING TO THIS FRIEND. this is how you reduce the risk of metadata leaks. the keyid of your key is not tied to you in any way, and when you are done talking to your friend, you can delete the key. its not Perfect Forward Secrecy, but it will have to do for now 3. You send the friend your new GPG key, and tell them where to contact you. you want to move the venue. maybe you create a different account on the same forum, maybe you pick a different forum entirely. or if using email, create a new account somewhere. obviously, you encrypt this message to your friends known public key. you tell your friend to create a new account for the conversation, a new key and send you the public key at the new location, encrypted to your new GPG key.   optionally, include a way to get back in touch if the venue goes away, like ""I'll post a question about whether Tails lets me use my logitech webcam in the 2nd working forum on reddit dnm's list""  any time you include something signed to prove your identity when switching to a new identity (new keypair, new forum location/names, etc), make sure you are only signing something meaningless, but something that works to identify you. for instance, if I was sending MyOldFriend a message, it might include:   a. a signed message saying, ""i am evilmotherfucker, verifying to MyOldFriend. today is Sun Mar 22 2015"" you want to make sure that signed message is useless to replay. if it just said, ""i am evilmotherfucker"", your friend could then take that message and pretend to be you somewhere else. if you signed a message saying ""i am evilmotherfucker, verifying that i will now be known as 'totallylegit'"", then that cryptographic message permanently ties you to the two identities. you just need to prove you are you. MyOldFriend will trust the rest of the details because this includes the signature and is encrypted to his key, without you having to tie them together cryptographically   b. instructions on where the new conversation venue should be: ""let's move off The Hub. I created an account called 'totallylegit' at Kingdom Forums, go make an account there and send me the next message there""   c. your new gpg key that is just for the conversation. ""here is my new public key to use just for our conversation. go make one on your side and send the public key to the totallylegit account at Kingdom. dont use my evilmotherfucker key after this, make sure you use this new one"".  Then, you take a+b+c all in one message, and you encrypt it to MyOldFriend's public key, and send it to him. from this point on, even if this initial venue (the hub in this example) is compromised, they are blind to what happens next. the new venue, Kingdom Forums in the example above, will only see two new users sign up and send each other encrypted PMs to unknown keyids.  this is overkill for a million different everyday communications, but if you want to have a conversation with someone and dont want anybody watching the metadata, its the way to go. stay aware of what times/frequency you check the drop accounts versus your known persona's login times  the first time MyOldFriend fucks up and uses your old keyid in a message at the new venue, you have to switch to a new set of keys and new venue.  pgp keys are free to create. forum accounts are free to create. email accounts are free to create. xmpp accounts are free to create. irc nicks are free to create. why use just one?

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","7469.0","2015-03-23T08:28:44","thoughts on pgp","General Discussion/Security","  Great advice!!! Here's an additional piece of advice...   Conventionally-encrypt the message as well (on top of the public-key encryption), using a string pre-agreed upon, with AES-256, using GPG -c.   This will serve to hide the Key-IDs (and message content) most effectively. Even if you were to use only 8 Diceware words, even at one trillion combinations per second (1x10^12) it will take the Feds longer than the age of the earth to brute-force. (Because Diceware uses dice to randomly choose words from a list, the Feds have no option but to use brute-force.)  Zaphod ","wanted to take a few minutes to remind everyone what pgp does and does not guarantee you in this environment.Signing - since nobody signs messages, you are never sure who sent them: everyone here is afraid to sign messages using pgp, because that may act as cryptographic proof that they are the author. the core issue is called ""non-repudiation"", and it means that you can't deny sending it or disavow its contents. Lack of signing - When you get a pgp encrypted pm, you are usually getting it encrypted to your public key, but not signed by the sender. this means that the author is not guaranteed to be whoever sent the pm. if a forum / mail provider /etc is compromised, you cannot trust the sender. for instance, if Alfred were to suddenly turn evil, he could send me a PM from MyOldFriend, encrypted to my public key. i would think that the message came from MyOldFriend. since everyone hates signing things, the only way to be reasonably sure you are talking to who you think you are is to make sure you respond to them using their pgp public key. and you have to know you have the right public key for that person. and preferably include a reference or quote from something they said in the last message, so they have a chance to realize that somebody is in the middle. otherwise, evil forum admin could see that MyOldFriend sent me an encrypted message, and immediately respond to MyOldFriend with a fake message from me, just encrypted to their public key and unsignedpgp also has lots of metadata in it, including the specific keyids the message is encrypted to, unless you are using the --throw-keyids option. this helps the gpg client figure out which secret key to use when people decrypt it. when people use the --throw-keyids option, your client has to try every secret key it has by brute force to find the right one to decrypt the message.but without --throw-keyids, anybody watching the transport method (like this forum, some random tor mail provider, etc) can see exactly what keys are being used. so if I used to be known as EvilMotherfucker, and had a PGP key with a keyid of 55BC8888 back then, and I signed up here as grimforecast, then an old friend sent me a message encrypted to keyid 55BC8888, what could somebody monitoring this forum learn? they could make a pretty good guess that grimforecast=EvilMotherfuckerParanoid PGP Usefor the truly paranoid, here is how you have a reasonably secure conversation with someone you know:1. you have to be certain that you are really talking to your friend without someone in the middle. maybe they sign something to prove their identity. they could also just clearsign something, like a hashed value so they could prove to you that they are who you think. Whatever they sign, it should NOT specify what new identity they are using or will be using, since that just ties the two together in a way that isn't needed. they just have to prove to you that they are who you think.2. you create a new GPG key, ONLY FOR USE WHEN TALKING TO THIS FRIEND. this is how you reduce the risk of metadata leaks. the keyid of your key is not tied to you in any way, and when you are done talking to your friend, you can delete the key. its not Perfect Forward Secrecy, but it will have to do for now3. You send the friend your new GPG key, and tell them where to contact you. you want to move the venue. maybe you create a different account on the same forum, maybe you pick a different forum entirely. or if using email, create a new account somewhere. obviously, you encrypt this message to your friends known public key. you tell your friend to create a new account for the conversation, a new key and send you the public key at the new location, encrypted to your new GPG key. optionally, include a way to get back in touch if the venue goes away, like ""I'll post a question about whether Tails lets me use my logitech webcam in the 2nd working forum on reddit dnm's list""any time you include something signed to prove your identity when switching to a new identity (new keypair, new forum location/names, etc), make sure you are only signing something meaningless, but something that works to identify you. for instance, if I was sending MyOldFriend a message, it might include:a. a signed message saying, ""i am evilmotherfucker, verifying to MyOldFriend. today is Sun Mar 22 2015"" you want to make sure that signed message is useless to replay. if it just said, ""i am evilmotherfucker"", your friend could then take that message and pretend to be you somewhere else. if you signed a message saying ""i am evilmotherfucker, verifying that i will now be known as 'totallylegit'"", then that cryptographic message permanently ties you to the two identities. you just need to prove you are you. MyOldFriend will trust the rest of the details because this includes the signature and is encrypted to his key, without you having to tie them together cryptographicallyb. instructions on where the new conversation venue should be: ""let's move off The Hub. I created an account called 'totallylegit' at Kingdom Forums, go make an account there and send me the next message there""c. your new gpg key that is just for the conversation. ""here is my new public key to use just for our conversation. go make one on your side and send the public key to the totallylegit account at Kingdom. dont use my evilmotherfucker key after this, make sure you use this new one"".Then, you take a+b+c all in one message, and you encrypt it to MyOldFriend's public key, and send it to him. from this point on, even if this initial venue (the hub in this example) is compromised, they are blind to what happens next. the new venue, Kingdom Forums in the example above, will only see two new users sign up and send each other encrypted PMs to unknown keyids.this is overkill for a million different everyday communications, but if you want to have a conversation with someone and dont want anybody watching the metadata, its the way to go. stay aware of what times/frequency you check the drop accounts versus your known persona's login timesthe first time MyOldFriend fucks up and uses your old keyid in a message at the new venue, you have to switch to a new set of keys and new venue.pgp keys are free to create. forum accounts are free to create. email accounts are free to create. xmpp accounts are free to create. irc nicks are free to create. why use just one?"

First off, I am a security junkie. I've worked both sides of the fence and like to think I know my shit. That being said, security, like psychology, has many different theories and ""schools of thought."" Since Jolly Roger's threads, while very informative, need the URLs fixed and include some topics that I personally would remove, I want to start a new, updated series where noobs can come read. I look forward to everybody's  discussion so that we can all be better informed. I'm sure you will learn something from me and I know I'll learn something from you.  My role in the darknet has always been a lurker. I bought stuff once or twice YEARS ago and I was one of those ""small-time, don't care"" type. Right now, I just hang out on the forums until after the holidays, can scrape the cash for vendor bond, etc., etc.  So to start it off. There is one thing you need to ALWAYS keep in mind. Feds are here. There is no doubt about it and they will try to identify you. Therefore, you  must learn and perfect one thing: Operational Security aka OPSEC. OPSEC is key. It is human nature to want to connect to others but the smallest bit of information that might not mean anything to you may mean the world to your adversary. For example, if somebody asks you the weather, it's sunny. Always. Comments about a lot of snow or rain can easily reduce the size of area to investigate. Some people believe in providing disinformation which can be useful in some scenarios, however, on the darknet, we all want to look alike. Similar to the reason gangbangers all dress alike (white tee, jeans, etc.); when the shit goes down and their description comes across the radio, the suspect looks like the bystanders. If you take away ONE thing from this post: OPSEC!  Second, get off Windows. Windows is such a huge target for malware. Also, there are reasons to believe Microsoft and the NSA work very closely together. Get on a Linux based system. Whether it is Tails or a custom build of Arch Linux (shameless plug: which I will be offering in the near future). Look for a post in the near future on how to set up a fail-closed (if Tor breaks, nothing works. No accidental IP leakage. read: sabu) Tor proxy.  Third, be vigilant and always use your head. When pentesting, it seems to me that the days of code execution on some Internet-facing hardware are going the way of the dinosaur.  The easiest way to compromise someone is social-engineering. So, point is,  DON'T CLICK SHIT! Always be wary of URLs being posted. Even if the URL looks legit, they may have some XSS vulnerability that will inject some Javascript (which better be disabled) and compromise you. Short story time: I am on a pentest breaking into a school. Send an e-mail to all of the staff saying we were contracted by the school to test password security. Go to our site, enter your password, receive a score. Received a few clicks. IT Admin caught it and sent a school-wide e-mail out saying it was spam and disregard, etc., etc. I thought that route was burnt. Wrong. The next day I had 80 more clicks. Curiosity killed the cat.  I don't want to turn this into a wall of text. I just wanted to introduce myself and give a couple basic tips that go a long way. In the future, I will be covering more technical stuff and it will be more detailed rather than a general post like this. I will be covering things like proxies, pgp, encryption, opsec (in more detail).  If you have any requests on a specific topic, let them here or PM me.   I look forward to talking with everyone and learning from one another.   Stay safe!",""

"The Hub Forums","PlunderinPete","6103.0","2014-12-19T16:38:06","Pete's Protect Yourself Series - Episode 0","General Discussion/Security"," I like arch because of its KISS philosophy. It is as bare bones as it gets without getting into having to compile everything like Gentoo/LFS. If compiling is your thing, you can use the abstree easily rather than pacman.  Regarding systemd, I really don't know enough about it yet to speak on it from a protect your privacy standpoint. I think I can apply my thoughts on compiling software from source vs compiled binaries to the systemd thing though. The benefit of compiling versus using binaries is that a binary could be backdoored without your knowledge. If you have to worry about binaries being backdoored by an adversary, then you're probably already fucked because you have a very determined attacker.

Show name:  Tor: Not so Anonymous      ","Steve: Today is the long-awaited episode that is going to disappoint some people, unfortunately, who may have been over-relying on the guarantees of anonymity that the Tor network promises. There was a paper that caught my attention, which I ended up being a little disappointed in. But the references, it had, like, two pages of references to prior work. So I dug deep and looked at everything that's been done. And bottom line is I wouldn't trust Tor to my anonymity any longer. It was a nice experiment. We first talked about it in Episode 70 in March of 2008. And we've revisited it a few times. But the designers made some choices which arguably back then may have made sense. But they're now built into the system, and in 2015 you can't count on them any longer.;Steve: So we're going to look at unmasking Tor's anonymity promises. And unfortunately, there's not much left when we really dig down. But we're going to talk about the news of the week also. There were two main things that happened. And that is news of Regin's apparent heritage. And just as we were going to air last week I talked about a vulnerability that I erroneously associated with Openwall. It turns out that's just where the link came in from a reposting to the Openwall list. But it wasn't about Openwall at all. It's about mainstream Linux, and it's really bad. So we'll talk about that. I saw in the mailbag an interesting question about SQRL I wanted to talk about, and then we'll plow into Tor.;Steve: Yeah. So first item is that Der Spiegel released some additional Edward Snowden documents, probably now about three weeks ago, maybe a little more than that. And those discussed a project that the NSA was known to have had called QWERTY, Q-W-E-R-T-Y, named, of course, after the top row, the top left row of characters on our typical QWERTY keyboard.In looking at the documents, a number of security researchers around the world, and specifically the guys at Kaspersky Lab, thought they looked familiar. And they dug into their Regin code and found absolute clear duplication, meaning that there is a strong reason to believe that Regin, which we were previously thinking, due to the targets that it had been aimed at, was probably not a Western tool, but may have, for example, been Russian in origin because the target seemed to be us, seemed to be more Western-oriented. But the evidence strongly implies that this is another one of the tools by the so-called Five Eyes team.Five Eyes is Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S., which are bound by a multilateral agreement called UKUSA, which is a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence. And this specifically looks like it was originally Australian in origin, but is now tied into this product that is directly traceable back to the NSA. And in fact in the first page of our show notes, I took a snapshot of a screenshot showing side-by-side code of Regin on the left and QWERTY on the right. And that particular snapshot highlights one instruction, a push instruction. But if you look above and below, it's all the same code. And there's just no question that this came from the same source.So even though attribution is notoriously difficult, and of course we were talking about this with regard to the Sony attack and where that came from, it really looks like there's some serious cyberespionage technology available to our forces, I mean, to our governments, and being shared among these countries. And remember that Regin is the one where attacks were - after it was identified, we looked at how it was being used, and it was things like going in and getting the itineraries of guests in hotels and figuring out who was traveling and which people were meeting with each other. And, I mean, true sort of cyberespionage, where you're creeping around the Internet, pulling records out from where you need it. And so this thing has infiltrated lots of networks in the past, and it looks like it's another one of the tools that the West has available to it. So really, really much more interesting than we thought.Okay, now, last week I had mentioned Ghost. It was a vulnerability that had just been posted. And as I mentioned at the top of the show, I mistakenly believed that it was tied to Openwall because it was in the Openwall mailing list, and that's the link that I had. And I promised to look into it for today's podcast. Well, it turns out it's just a straight-up very bad Linux vulnerability. ;Steve: Which is, yeah, which has existed since 2000 and was sort of coincidentally removed in 2012. But it existed for 12 years, and it was never perceived until researchers at Qualys just were doing an internal security audit and stumbled over this thing. Even though it was removed, because it wasn't at the time seen as a security vulnerability, it still exists in many packages which are deployed that haven't bothered to update themselves to the latest, to the very latest. It's in glibc. And it is one of the more fundamental functions that exists. It's in the function - I'm looking for it in my notes.Leo: Glibc is on every - is everywhere.;Steve: Yeah. So, okay. So because it wasn't seen before as a security problem, there was no move to go back and retroactively make sure that nobody was using this 12-year span of glibc libraries. So it exists in any Linux system that was built with glibc-2.2, which was released on November 10, 2000; and it was fixed in between releases of glibc versions 2.17 and 2.18. So anyway, this is the kind of thing where you absolutely want to make sure, if you have exposure to the public Internet, specifically if you're running a server, a Linux Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, Ubuntu, I mean, just across the board. As you said, Leo, glibc is intrinsic to Linux, its core networking functionality. So this was a biggie, definitely something that you want to make sure you've gotten yourself patched for."
"The Hub Forums","Baraka","7039.0","2015-02-11T07:31:25","Security Expert Steve Gibson's Comments Might Just Save Your Life","General Discussion/Security","More:   ","Steve: So with Tor, it turns out, attacks like that also work. It's possible to rule out a huge number of possible links that are in fact - where it just doesn't work, based on what somebody knows of the Tor network. But you then end up with a bunch of candidates. And then you apply the second-level attack, which is testing the candidates. And it turns out that is a huge weakness. So if an active attacker believed that two points were communicating and had the ability to deliberately introduce deterministic changes in the traffic flow, they would see evidence of that coming out the other side.And so the final real weakness is that, if you have an active attack, rather than a passive attack, meaning that you do something to alter the traffic, you can quickly confirm or rule out assumptions of possible pairings. And when you then operate at the scale of a nation-state, with big taps into the Internet all over the place, and when Tor is an obvious Target for bad guys using it to mask their identity, you've got means, you've got motivation, and you've got budget in order to pull this off.So I would consider that Tor is useful as part of a defense in-depth strategy. That is, I wouldn't say don't bother using it if you really want anonymity. But I would say, first of all, don't do anything illegal. Don't do anything that you wouldn't want the federal government to know about because they fit the profile of someone able to penetrate Tor. I would say, unfortunately, the dream of a Tor user of just being able to sit back in their home or apartment somewhere with their public IP address and use Tor with confidence that they're able to do anything they want to at all, and no one can get them because they're using Tor, that's just not real.So the only way, I mean, if you absolutely need anonymity, is to roll together old-school approaches and new-school. Go somewhere to do this as far away from home as convenient. Be anonymous there. Pay with cash. Don't go somewhere familiar. Don't know anyone. Don't make any friends. Don't talk to anyone. Don't stay long. Plan ahead. Rehearse for speed. Get it done and leave. Don't do anything there that involves your own real-world identity. Pay with cash. Change the MAC address of your machine. Maybe buy a cheap laptop just for this purpose so that it knows nothing, you have no history tied to it and so forth.And I would say, since you have control over Tor, use more than three nodes. Don't use the default settings. Use as many as you can so that you're - oh, and use widely geographically dispersed Tor nodes. Those will be slower because all the traffic bouncing around has to go through all of those locations. So, yes, it's not going to be as quick and easy. But to get anonymity, it can't be. Do what you need to do and then pack up shop and leave. So new school and old school. But unfortunately, all of the research demonstrates today that Tor was an interesting experiment. But what we know about what the NSA is capable of doing and some evidence of what has happened shows us that we just can't rely on it for one-stop shopping of being anonymous on the Internet. ;Leo: Is there any way to be anonymous?Steve: The problem is this notion of near real-time versus high-latency non-real-time. I mean, if something like Tor existed for email, then the real Achilles heel is traffic. And I don't know how you can arrange that. If your traffic disappeared into something large, where there was no further visibility, like say you disappeared behind a university-scale NAT, where all of UCLA was 10-dot, you know, inside their network, and then you also took some old-school steps to be anonymous, it's difficult to know how they could penetrate. But maybe UCLA NAT router tracks you inside. So if law enforcement came to that IP, they'd say, okay, now we need your records to figure out who inside the network was using this at this time of day. So it probably still is possible. I think anonymity is something of an illusion on the Internet, Leo.Leo: You could. But, I mean, let's say you did use a library, and you didn't check in, and you hid, you disguised yourself, and you...Steve: You used a hoodie,Leo: And you keep moving, I think is obviously the key.Steve: Yup, yup.Leo: You could do some stuff anonymously; yeah?Steve: I do think, I mean, basically, though, there we're saying the Internet isn't providing our anonymity, the real world is providing our anonymity.Leo: Right. You have to be anonymous in the real world for that to work; right.Steve: Yes.Leo: Because if the real world knows who you are, the Internet will somehow cough that up or can be made to cough that up.Steve: Unfortunately, I think it really can. So what I wanted to do was to basically revisit this and dispel any belief in our listeners that use Tor and you're golden. You're really not. If somebody wants to find you, they probably can.Leo: All right. Fascinating stuff. As they're pointing out in the chatroom, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in a library. So there you go.Steve: He stuck around too long.Leo: Waited a little too long to move on.Steve: You don't want to be chatting up the librarian. You want to keep your head down, get in...Leo: Keep moving.Steve: Oh, and don't go back.Leo: And never go back."

What this DOES remind me of is the way they uncovered Ross Ulbricht.  If you recall, they found some forum where he had posted his first advert for SR using an account that originally had his doxx email account linked to it.  He later changed that email to an anonymous one but the damage was done b/c LE was somehow able to find out the original email address he created the account with.  THAT is what this memex stuff is good for.  As long as you keep your IRL/clearnet web presence completely isolated from your darknet presence memex will not work on you.",""

To achieve this goal, Memex will not only scrape content from the millions of regular web pages that get ignored by commercial search engines but will also chronicle thousands of sites on the so-called Dark Webâsuch as sites like the former Silk Road drug emporium that are part of the TOR networkâs Hidden Services.  These sites, which have .onion web addresses, are accessible only through the TOR browser and only to those who know a siteâs specific address. Although sites do exist that index some Hidden Services pagesâoften around a specific topicâand there is even already a search engine called Grams for uncovering sites selling illicit drugs and other contraband, the majority of Hidden Services remain well under the radar.  White says part of the Memex project is aimed at determining just how much of TOR traffic is related to Hidden Services sites. âThe best estimates before were in the single digitsâin the one-thousands,â he says. âBut we think there are, at any given time, between 30,000 and 40,000 Hidden Service Onion sites that have content on them that one could index.â  The content on Hidden Services is publicâin the sense that itâs not password protectedâbut is not readily accessible through a commercial search engine. âWeâre trying to move toward an automated mechanism of finding [Hidden Services sites] and making the public content on them accessible,â White says. The Darpa team also wants to find a way to better understand the turnover of such sitesâthe relationships that exist for example between two sites when one goes down and a seemingly unrelated site pops up.  But the creators of Memex donât want just to index content on previously undiscovered sites. They also want to use automated methods to analyze that content in order to uncover hidden relationships that would be useful to law enforcement, the military, and even the private sector. The Memex project currently has eight partners involved in testing and deploying prototypes. White wonât say who the partners are but they plan to test the system around various subject areas or domains. The first domain they targeted were sites that appear to be involved in human trafficking. But the same technique could be applied to tracking Ebola outbreaks or âany domain where there is a flood of online content, where youâre not going to get it if you do queries one at a time and one link at a time,â he says.  In a demo conducted for 60 Minutes, Whiteâs team showed how law enforcement could possibly track the movement of peopleâboth trafficked and traffickersâbased on data related to online advertisements for sex. The 60 Minutes piece wasnât clear about how this was done and appeared to focus on the IP address of where the ads were hosted, implying that tracking where an ad moves from one IP address to another could reveal to law enforcement where the trafficker is located. But White says the IP address is the least important information they analyze. Instead they focus on other data points.  âSometimes itâs a function of IP address, but sometimes itâs a function of a phone number or address in the ad or the geolocation of a device that posted the ad,â he says. âThere are sometimes other artifacts that contribute to location.â  For example, an ad attempting to sell the sexual services of a woman or child in one locale might pop up in another location and include a regional address or phone number. White says this kind of data has been used by investigators to find women who were being trafficked.  âYou can imagine a scenario where people are moving around the country with women and are interested in advertising themâthey post ads in different places. It can involve the same women and some of the same info like phone numbers. Via methods of connecting content through shared attributesâmeaning the same number or image appearing on adsâyou can create a network to understand where these things are connected and where they may be located.â  He notes that the connection from the online ads to the real world is not always accurate or a one-to-one match. âBut thatâs why there are investigators and prosecutors involved to do interpretation and make decisions. Darpa just creates the tech, and organizations adopt the technology to use it.â  White wonât say how much the program is costing, but says itâs comparable to other data science projects that have been funded at $10 to $20 million.

You're right though, but, it'll still work because once they're booted off theres and can't connect. They'll, ideally, go to choose a wi-fi to re-connect manually, see yours, connect to it and since it's open, think they're connecting to theirs with a saved password. Remember, you also want to be on the same channel and also want to have higher output power and have a stronger signal to end up higher on the list of APs.  What are you using to test/create APs? Aircrack-ng? Try these commands:  Put your card in monitor mode (your wifi card may be named something other than wlan0):  airmon-ng start wlan0   Next, start looking for your target AP you're looking to clone (again, double check mon0 is the name given to your card when put in monitor mode):  airodump-ng mon0  Create your fake ap:  airbase-ng -a <BSSID> --essid <WIFI NAME> -c <CHANNEL> mon0 Fire some deauth packets:  aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <BSSID> Again, it's been a long time so some of these commands/arguments could be wrong so check out the aircrack-ng manpages/websites. Also, there is something like ""txpower"" to increase the power of the output. I remember reading something awhile ago about there being a cap on the amount of power you can put out in the US, but you can set your card's radio regulations to another countries to get even MORE power. Again, you're going to have to research this because 1) never used it and 2) I don't remember the exact details (or if it is even accurate. I just remember hearing about it somewhere).   You're right though. You are relying on the target not realizing they're connecting to an open network versus their typical WPA2-encrypted network.

Because from what I've heard, a lot of routers will report that WPS is enabled, but that this is a bug in the firmware, and it's actually disabled.     Did you spoof the MAC address of the Evil Twin to match the target access point? If not, try that, and if you do, let me know how you go. Last time I heard, some but not all OS's have got defences against such attacks but I think it's still viable.     Alternatively, look into something called KARMA. People's devices constantly send out probe requests for wifi access points they've connected to in the past. This includes public wifi. The idea here is that you jam their access point and prevent them from connecting. Meanwhile, you detect their probe requests, generate an Evil Twin of that open access point, and they automatically connect. The trick here is that all of this happens without them noticing. You then serve them a phishing page -- they're connected to your public wifi hotspot, but may still think they're connected to their own hotspot.  Another alternative that I remember: rather than creating an access point that's a perfect Evil Twin, you create a public hotspot named [name of their hotspot]_2. You jam their original access piont and they can't connect. They bring up a list of available access points and they see one that's got their name with _2 after it. And they connect. You then serve a phishing page.  ^ You may think that's implausible, but I'm pretty sure I've seen this little bug occur for me where my access point was spazzing out and got duplicated. The absence of encryption is a little suspicious, but you're relying on a bit of SE there.

Both of you have mentioned to create a similar, unencrypted twin, drop the client and hope for the user to manually connect with your honeypot, where you can proceed and serve the phishing page. not as smooth as making it automatically, but thats a real good idea and when doing it right, pretty high chances of getting access.  So if the neighbour is connect to his wifi ""WIFI1"", you make an unencrypted twin also ssid WIFI1. Then constantly drop him, until he freaks out, sees the other WIFI1, and since he probably doesnt expect a hack, he might connect to it. Then gets a error page, if possible disguised as the router company (if ssid is netgear for example, make a netgear error page), which says something that the wpa needs to be entered to fix the wifi problem. sweet.

The information of all the transactions are kept in the Bitcoin block which is computed by and kept by the miners.  This is why rewards are given to miners, as they are doing all the number crunching.  The rewards also promote more miners so there is a spread and no-single miner with less than around 40% of the mining power can cheat the numbers.   So now we have the first part: Bitcoin Blockchain - The Ledger  The next important thing is how are funds moved around in the Bitcoin Blockchain, if Bitcoins are not moved in and out of the wallet?  In a simplified manner, Blockchain is actually a big list of addresses and the funds in them.  When funds are spent into an address, the Blockchain will write that the funds were put into the address or moved out of an address.   On to the second part: Funding an Address  How does the Blockchain know who owns the address?  In order to understand this, it is important to first understand what an address is.  An address consists of 3 parts (based on version 1 of Bitcoin Addresses).  1. Private key 2. Public Key : a hash of the  private key 3. Address : a hash of the  public key with a checksum, then convert to base58  (source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses)  Now that we know all 3 are actually related and unique to each other, we can see as we go from 1 to 3, there is a layer of security between each.  You can use a private key to recreate the public key and address, but not the other way around.  Now that we know what the keys are, we look at how it's used:   In the third part: Spending 1. Address: once a fund has been spent into the address, we now have a balance in the address 2. Public Key: the public key is exposed to create a transaction when preparing to send 3. Private Key: now to complete the transaction, the private key is used to sign and identify the rights to send the transaction created with the public key  As can be seen, the private key identifies the right to spend from an address on the Blockchain, as the Private Key is used to derive the Public Key and Address.  Therefore, the private key just shows permission to move funds in the Blockchain for a specific address.   Finally, we have the last part: The Wallet  If a wallet does not hold Bitcoins, what does it hold?  A wallet is more similar in analogy to an account book that holds your account #s and passwords.  What the native Bitcoin-QT wallet client actually does is:  1. Hold private key/public key/addresses to be used for moving funds in the Blockchain 2. Connects and sends the transaction instructions accordingly 3. Scan and keeps records of your transactions from the Blockchain  Some wallets don't even do #3 as they use online sources for information about your account (as having a wallet with the full Blockchain can take up quite a bit of space and continue to grow - since it is a copy of  all transactions in the ledger).  Technically, you would not even need a wallet to access your funds.  You just need the private key for your address.  Cold storage is when funds are sent to an address where the private keys are not online or accessible by computer.  This could be as simple as printing your public and private key onto a piece of paper, to saving it in a text file in your USB and sticking it in your drawer.  Without the private key, the address can not be accessed.  If there are any questions or feedback in regards to how Bitcoin, Blockchain, Address/Public/Private Keys, and Wallets, please feel free to contact me at any time.

"The Hub Forums","SpendingTime","9222.0","2015-05-21T20:48:26","[Article] Hackers build a new Tor client designed to beat the NSA","General Discussion/Security"," Hackers build a new Tor client designed to beat the NSA  **CLEARNET** http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tor-astoria-timing-attack-client/   Any thoughts from those in the know?","Anonymity's toughest adversaries are hackers with the full-force and backing of Beijing, London, and Washington, D.C. With the threat of powerful intelligence agencies, like the NSA, looming large, researchers have built a new Tor client called Astoria designed specifically to make eavesdropping harder for the world's richest, most aggressive, and most capable spies to track Tor users from start to finish.Tor, the worldÂs most popular anonymity network, works like this: A user fires up the client and connects to the network through what's called an entry node. To reach a website anonymously, the user's Internet traffic is then passed encrypted through a so-called middle relay and then an exit relay (and back again). That user-relay connection is called a circuit. The website on the receiving end doesnÂt know who is visiting, only that a faceless Tor user has connected.An eavesdropper shouldn't be able to know who the Tor user is either, thanks to the encrypted traffic being routed through 6,000 nodes in the network.But something called ""timing attacks"" change the situation. When an adversary takes control of both the entry and exit relays, research shows they can potentially deanonymize Tor users within minutes.A full 58 percent of Tor circuits are vulnerable to network-level attackers, such as the NSA or Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), when they access popular websites, according to new research from American and Israeli academics. Chinese users are the most vulnerable of all to these kinds of attacks, with researchers finding 85.7 percent of all Tor circuits from the country to be vulnerable.Even though Tor is designed to provide complete anonymity to its users, the NSA's position means they can potentially see and measure both traffic entering the Tor network and the traffic that comes out. When an intelligence agency can see both, simple statistics help an autonomous system at their control match the data up in a timing attack and discover the identity of the sender.Anonymity over.This kind of threat has been known to Tor developers for over a decade. They've been trying to make eavesdropping difficult for spy agencies for just as long.To counter the threat, American-Israeli researchers built Astoria, a new Tor client focused on defeating autonomous systems that can break Tor's anonymity.Astoria reduces the number of vulnerable circuits from 58 percent to 5.8 percent, the researchers say. The new solution is the first designed to beat even the most recently proposed asymmetric correlation attacks on Tor.Designed to beat such attacks, Astoria differs most significantly from Tor's default client in how it selects the circuits that connect a user to the network and then to the outside Internet. The tool, at its foundation, is an algorithm designed to more accurately predict attacks and then securely select relays that mitigate timing attack opportunities for top-tier adversaries.Astoria adroitly considers how circuits should, according to the researchers, be made ""when there are no safe possibilities,"" how to safely balance the growing bandwidth load across the Tor network, and how to keep Tor's performance ""reasonable"" and relatively fast even when Astoria is in its most secure configuration.All this while under the unblinking gaze of the world's best intel services.Defeating timing attacks against Tor completely isn't possible because of how Tor is built, but making the attacks more costly and less likely to succeed is a pastime that Tor developers have dedicated a decade to. Astoria follows in those footsteps.By choosing relays based on lowering the threat of eavesdropping by autonomous systems and then choosing randomly if no safe passage is possible, Astoria aims to minimize the information gained by an adversary watching an entire circuit.""In addition to providing high-levels of security against such attacks, Astoria also has performance that is within a reasonable distance from the current Tor client,' the researchers wrote. ""Unlike other AS-aware Tor clients, Astoria also considers how circuits should be built in the worst case-i.e., when there are no safe relays that are available. Further, Astoria is a good network citizen and works to ensure that the all circuits created by it are load-balanced across the volunteer driven Tor network.""In an upgrade aimed at making Tor even more usable for the average person, the newest Tor Browser allows a sliding scale of security that balances speed and usability with strong security preferences.Similarly, Astoria provides multiple security options. However, it's both most effective and most usable when at its highest security level, the researchers say, so ""Astoria is a usable substitute for the vanilla Tor client only in scenarios where security is a high priority."""

"The Hub Forums","TheRetardedCynic","8846.0","2015-05-08T02:29:38","NSA's Bulk Collection Of Americans' Phone Data Is Illegal, Appeals Court Rules ","General Discussion/Security"," Eyder Peralta   The National Security Agency's practice of collecting data about Americans' telephone calls in bulk goes beyond what Congress intended when it wrote Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday.  The three-judge panel was asked to consider whether the program violated the Constitution. Instead, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel punted on the constitutional claim, deciding the program was simply not authorized by federal law.  One of the big reasons it is hard to discern congressional intent in this case, the court wrote, is that the bulk collection program has been shrouded in secrecy. So it cannot ""reasonably be said"" that Congress OK'd ""a program of which many members of Congress â and all members of the public â were not aware.""  The court concludes that it has no qualms about taking this step because if Congress wants to ""authorize such a farâreaching and unprecedented program, it has every opportunity to do so, and to do so unambiguously.""  According to The New York Times, this is ""the first time a higher-level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the program, which since 2006 has repeatedly been approved in secret by a national security court.""  The NSA's collection of phone metadata came back into the spotlight after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that shed light on the scope of the program.  One of the first leaked documents was a secret court ruling that ordered Verizon to hand over the telephone metadata of all its customers. Metadata does not mean the content of calls. Instead it means things like time, phone numbers and duration of calls.  The panel has vacated a lower court's decision to dismiss the case and has sent it back for further review. The panel also refused to order a preliminary end to the program, saying Congress is currently debating the NSA's bulk collection program.  ""We deem it prudent to pause to allow an opportunity for debate in Congress that may (or may not) profoundly alter the legal landscape,"" the panel wrote.  Update at 11:47 a.m. ET. Obama Believes Bulk Collection Should End:  Without specifically commenting on the court's ruling, Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said President Obama has already expressed a preference for ending the bulk collection of metadata as it exists today.  As we reported back in January 2014, Obama said he would prefer that the government not keep a massive database of Americans' telephone data. Instead, the data could live elsewhere and the U.S. government could query the information based on each investigation.  ""We continue to work closely with members of Congress from both parties to do just that and we have been encouraged by good progress on bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would implement these important reforms,"" Price said in a statement.  Update at 11:44 a.m. ET. 'Resounding Victory For The Rule Of Law':  ""This decision is a resounding victory for the rule of law,"" ACLU Staff Attorney Alex Abdo, who argued the case before the three-judge panel last September, said in a statement. ""For years, the government secretly spied on millions of innocent Americans based on a shockingly broad interpretation of its authority. The court rightly rejected the government's theory that it may stockpile information on all of us in case that information proves useful in the future. Mass surveillance does not make us any safer, and it is fundamentally incompatible with the privacy necessary in a free society.""  The ACLU also urged Congress to ""up its reform game"" to align itself with the concerns raised by the 2nd Circuit.  Update at 10:21 a.m. ET. 'Preceded By Substantial Debate':  The panel argued that when Congress passed the Patriot Act, it could not have understood the sweeping nature of the program. The panel explains:      ""Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans. Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism. But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language. There is no evidence of such a debate in the legislative history of Â§ 215, and the language of the statute, on its face, is not naturally read as permitting investigative agencies, on the approval of the FISC [the secret national security court], to do any more than obtain the sorts of information routinely acquired in the course of criminal investigations of 'money laundering [and] drug dealing.' ""  Update at 9:57 a.m. ET. Echoes Some Members Of Congress:  NPR's David Welna, who covers national security for the network, tells us the ruling echoes what some members of Congress have been saying. David reports:      ""This ruling dovetails with what one of the lead authors of the Patriot Act â former House Judiciary Committee chairman James Sensenbrenner â said last week about Section 215: 'I can say in no uncertain terms that Congress did not intend to allow the bulk collection of Americans' records. The government's overbroad collection is based on a blatant misreading of the law.'      ""The House Judiciary Committee last week approved a revision of Section 215 that bars bulk data collection under that provision. Senate Majority Leader McConnell has a bill pending that would extend Section 215 without changes until 2020.""  ",""

Whether ECC or something else replaces it remains to be seen.  Although ECC was seen as the up and coming technology, given that it was prompted so heavily by the NSA now makes it suspect. We know that at least some of the applications using ECC such as a random number generator (RNG) had odd constants included as part of the standard, likely at the NSA's insistence. Another problem with ECC is that many curves are currently under patent in the U.S., so those are not likely to find wide adoption on that basis.

Though I will admit, before DNM's & bitcoin, this was the standard way to communicate with vendors of RC's and probably still is.  Who done do that before?  I'm sure a great many of us. ",""

I found that TMP uses brainwallet.org to generate the keys, so I adopted that portion of their system.  However, I don't expect buyers/vendors to create the script hashes themselves; they simply provide the public keys and BlackBank takes care of the address and scripts.  The redeemscript is kept in the database after generation.  The vendor does not have to generate multiple addresses because BlackBank does not generate any multi-sig until the vendor accepts the purchase.  So the vendor only needs to create private/public key pairs on a per purchase basis.  This saves them the time of generating multiple private/public key pairs at a time.  During the time that a vendor has not accepted a purchase, the buyer can always cancel the purchase as the funds are not in a multi-sig address yet.  When a buyer releases the funds, this is when the private key enters the BlackBank market system and using the combination of BlackBank's and the Buyer's keys, creates a raw transaction from the redeemscript and provided information, then releases the funds to a payment address from the vendor.  An unsigned transaction hex is also provided to the vendor and buyer after a multi-sig escrow begins transaction.  The hex contains all the information they require to check/verify the transaction, as well as sign and send a transaction without the assistance of BlackBank (if say BlackBank was unavailable).  Cheers, MDParity  PS. I will definitely be looking up the white papers for BIP32.  From a brief overlook, deterministic wallets could definitely be useful; I need to take a more in depth look on how it's used and if it can be implemented.  Thanks for the info, as it's greatly appreciated.",""
"The Hub Forums","mdparity","895.0","2014-02-18T20:29:15","How to: multisig transaction with P2SH","General Discussion/Security","Howdy,  Read the wiki I provided.  The key is only provided at the time an order is finalized.  The public/private key pairs should only be used once per transaction.  I'm sure if you look back up, signing a transaction for every purchase would be incredibly difficult for a buyer/vendor.  BlackBank could provide a partially signed transaction, but then the user would need to complete the sign, then send the raw transaction, for every single purchase.  If a buyer really doesn't want to provide a private key at the time of payment, a ""Manual FE code"" is provided if they don't want to submit their private key (which doesn't make sense since it's a disposable one-time use key - the private/public key pairs discloses nothing about the vendor or buyer).  As per my suggestion is to use ""brainwallet.org"" to generate a random public/private key pair, you can't trace the public key through the blockchain (the private/public/address generated are not used for actual transactions - is is used only for signing).    Regardless, once the payment is made, the transaction still pays directly to the vendor's wallet, which is traceable through the blockchain.  At the end of the day, the bitcoin still has to reach the vendor's address.  However, as stated, the public/private key pair has nothing to do with the payment/withdrawal addresses.  How can a randomly generated public/private key from brainwallet.org be able to link to a vendor/buyer?  Cheers, MDParity",""

How can it be made easy to verify that the redeemscript that your P2SH address is made of when doing this sort of automated escrow system that a market would use doesn't have two public keys produced by the market (for the puprose of taking your coins).   You could of course, message your vendor every single time before making your payment ""I was given redeemscript [blah] is your public key in there?"" I doubt vendors would be down with that solution. You could also require vendors to provide a signed copy of each public key they use, so you could verify that it was theirs. I don't think a market wants to store all those signed keys nor does a vendor want to go thru the burden of creating them all.  The easiest solution for a vendor would be to have the vendor provide a public extended key from a BIP32 wallet. The problem with this is of course it is now trivial to track payments to you on the blockchain, because you just look for every redeemscript presented with one of your keys in it.   I will admit that I'm not too awesome at ECC... is there anyway to prove to a buyer that one of the addresses in the redeemscript is from the vendor without leaking any of the vendor's info? ",""

","General Discussion/Legal","Inside a Giant Dark-Web Scheme to Sell Counterfeit Coupons Author: Andy Greenberg Date of Publication: 05.28.15  Time of Publication: 3:35 pm    https://www.wired.com/2015/05/inside-a-million-dollar-dark-web-coupon-counterfeiting-scheme/  The dark web has become notorious for the sale of drugs, stolen financial data, and even guns, but in their latest crackdown, the feds are dragging another unlikely cash cow of the contraband underground into the spotlight: counterfeit coupons. For one fraudster, those fakes were good for tens of millions of dollars worth of every consumer product from kitty litter to Clif bars to condoms.  On Thursday, the FBI indicted 30-year old Beauregard Wattigney, a Louisiana-based technician for ITT Technical Institute, on charges of wire fraud and trademark counterfeiting on the Dark Web marketplaces Silk Road and Silk Road 2. More specifically, Wattigney is accused of being the online coupon kingpin known as ThePurpleLotus or TheGoldenLotus, a figure who sold packages of coupons for virtually every consumer product imaginable including alcohol, cigarettes, cleaning supplies, beauty products, video games, and consumer electronics. The spoofed couponsâin most cases offering discounts just as effective as the real thingâwere offered in packages that cost customers around $25 in bitcoin, but offered hundreds of dollars in total fraudulent discounts.  The FBI accuses Wattigney of doing $1 million in total damage to the affected companiesâwhich range from Sony to Crest to Kraft. But Jane Beauchamp, president of the fraud consultancy Brand Technologies, says sheâs been tracking ThePurpleLotus for more than a year on the Dark Web, and assesses the damages to be âsignificantlyâ higher. âIâd estimate that the consumer packaged goods industry experienced tens of millions of dollars of counterfeit coupon damages,â from just ThePurpleLotusâs sales, Beauchamp says.  ThePurpleLotusâs schemes demonstrate how absurdly easy coupon fraud remains.  âWe have the best, most consistent, most precise, most scannable, most accepted, most diverse collection of coupons anywhere. They are not on anyoneâs ban list. They are not blacklisted anywhere,â reads PurpleLotusâs vendor profile on Agora, the largest currently active black market on the Dark Web. âThey will save you a ton of moneyâ¦If you use the coupons for the everyday things that you normally buy, the golden goose will continue to lay golden eggs.â  In addition to those packages of pre-made coupons, ThePurpleLotus also offered a $200 package of âcoupon-making lessons.â That digital guide to counterfeiting included a powerpoint presentation showing the step-by-step process of coupon fraud, from generating bar codes to copying legitimate-looking logos and watermarks. In an accompanying video, set to a tasteful soundtrack of Bach piano compositions, he demonstrates the technique on screen.  In his tutorials, ThePurpleLotus explained the simple breakdown of barcode creation using the increasingly universal GS1 standard: GS1 codes begin with a âcompany prefixâ that can be copied from any of the companyâs products. The next six digits are the âoffer code,â which can be any random number for a counterfeit coupon, followed by the savings amount listed in cents and the required number of item purchases necessary to receive the discount. âYou can be up and running and making coupons in an hour,â PurpleLotusâs guide reads. âThe more you make the faster you getâ¦You are a coupon ninja if you can make one in under two minutes.â  In messages on Silk Road 2 forums last year, ThePurpleLotus boasted of launching a new automatic coupon-generating service so that customers could pay a fee to generate a custom coupon for the product of their choice, rather than having to learn his counterfeiting tricks or choose from his existing stock of fraudulent files. The service even offered a free preview of the counterfeit image, but required a fee to remove ThePurpleLotusâs own watermark from it. âCan you think of five items that I do not offer coupons for but that you or your family use on a regular basis? Pay a small fee, have a beautiful looking coupon, and then go save hundreds stocking up on that one item,â ThePurpleLotus wrote. âNow 100% of every item you ever wanted can have itâs own coupon!â  Just one of ThePurpleLotusâs counterfeit coupons, copied and shared endlessly around the internet, can lead to enormous financial losses for the retail companies affected, says Brand Technologyâs Jane Beauchamp. She says two individual counterfeit coupons targeting her clientsâone giving $7 off and another offering a $9 discount on common household productsâled to close to $2 million each in fraudulent discounts. âFrom windshield wipers to toilet paper, this included virtually every item for sale in a grocery store,â says Beauchamp.  ThePurpleLotus also offered a $200 package of âcoupon-making lessons,â showing the step-by-step process of coupon fraud.  In fact, ThePurpleLotusâs schemes demonstrate how absurdly easy coupon fraud remains, she argues. Beauchamp points to the insecure method of coupon verification that major retailers like Target, Walmart, and many others useâwhich essentially amounts to no authentication, only a blacklists of known fraudulent coupons like one maintained by an industry group known as the Coupon Information Center. A coupon fraudster can merely use the publicly available GS1 barcode algorithm to encode whatever discount they want into a new fake coupon. If itâs not yet on that blacklist and looks realistic to the cashier, itâs accepted, says Beauchamp. âUsually the cashiers donât even take the time to question it. If it âbeeps,â itâs good,â she says.  Beauchamp notes that when a counterfeit coupon is spotted at the register, consumers often say they were given the coupon by a friend or âfound it on the internetâ and face no consequences. Other coupon fraudsters are careful to use self checkout at large stores, as Wattigney advised one customer in a message included in the indictment.  âEvery day new codes get added to the blacklist,â says Beauchamp. But new fraudulent coupons are being created at a faster rate than ever, she says. âThe problem is that itâs a blacklist, not a whitelist. And that affects the whole industry.â  The Coupon Information Corporation, which maintains one list of known fraudulent coupons on behalf of the retail industry, counters that other security measures beyond a blacklist exist to combat coupon fraud. But Bud Miller, the president of the CIC, declined to comment on those security measures for fear of helping criminals to circumvent them. âIf you make a high quality counterfeit coupon, from time to time it can be passed at the cash register,â Miller told WIRED. âThe industry is working on a number of solutions, from better identification, to what weâve done, to prosecutions.â  âIâd estimate that the consumer packaged goods industry experienced tens of millions of dollars of counterfeit coupon damages.â âJane Beauchamp  If Wattigney is in fact proven to be ThePurpleLotus, he wonât be the first to be caught spoofing coupons en masse. Just over two years ago, 25-year-old Lucas Henderson was sentenced to three years of supervised release and forced to pay $900,000 in restitution for his own massive coupon fraud scheme, which he ran under the pseudonym âThe Coupon Guy.â Henderson, a Lubbock, Texas college student, had distributed his self-made coupons through Web forums including 4Chan.  Nor was the PurpleLotus the last to try the coupon scheme. Though ThePurpleLotus and TheGoldenLotus accounts have been inactive for monthsâand at one point last year the ThePurpleLotus announced his âretirementâ on the Silk Road 2 forumsâother coupon counterfeiters like a group calling itself Team Lotus have taken his place on dark web markets like Agora.  ThePurpleLotus was perhaps the first to move the coupon fraud economy under the cover of the Dark Webâs anonymity.

Unlike other Silk Road sellers, who [were] shipping physical contraband ranging from heroin to cocaine to guns, Wattigneyâs transactions may seem relatively benign: mere counterfeit images and software tools.

The Silk Road online marketplace (hereinafter, Silk Road 1.0) was an online ""Dark Market,"" that is, an internet forum that was available to users across the United States and around the world for, among other things, selling illegal drugs, goods, and services.  3. In about 2013, Silk Road 1.0 was dismantled as part of a federal law enforcement operation. Based on forensic analysis of images of servers seized during the dismantlement of Silk Road 1.0, the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation (""FBI"") was able to recover, among other things, transaction histories and private message communications associated with Silk Road 1.0 users.  4. Following the Silk Road 1.0 dismantlement, another Silk Road website (hereinafter, Silk Road 2.0) came online on November 6, 2013, run by former administrators of Silk Road 1.0. Silk Road 2.0 was also later dismantled, and the alleged operator arrested on or about November 6, 2014.   5. WATTIGNEY created and used online monikers, including ""GoldenLotus,"" ""PurpleLotus,"" ""MoxDiamond,"" and ""NickMode,"" among others, on Silk Road 1.0 and 2.0.   6. WATTIGNEY used the aforementioned monikers to create and sell counterfeit coupons for various goods and services to users of Silk Road 1.0 and Silk Road 2.0. For example, one counterfeit coupon WATTIGNEY created and sold allowed users to purchase $50.00 Visa Gift Cards for approximately $0.01 each.   7. The coupons WATTIGNEY sold on Silk Road 1.0 and Silk Road 2.0 affected more than 50 manufacturers, retailers, and online coupon retailers when they were used by the people purchasing them, resulting in an intended loss to the manufacturers and retailers in excess of $1,000,000.   B. THE CONSPIRACY:   Beginning on or about May 12, 2012, and continuing through on or about November 6, 2014, in the Eastern District of Louisiana and elsewhere, the defendant, BEAU WATTIGNEY, and others known and unknown, having devised a scheme and artifice to defraud, and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, willfully, knowingly, and intentionally combined, conspired, confederated, and agreed together with other unidentified coconspirators, to execute such scheme and artifice by transmitting and causing to be transmitted writings, signs, signals, pictures and sounds by means of wire communication in interstate and foreign commerce, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343.   C.   MANNER AND MEANS:  In furtherance of the conspiracy, and to effect the objects of the conspiracy, the following acts, among others, were committed in the Eastern District of Louisiana and elsewhere:   1. Designing the counterfeit coupons to look like original print-at-home manufacturer's coupons by knowingly using and including counterfeit trademarks in connection with, and on, the counterfeit coupons, including Hopster, Coupons.Com, SmartSource, and Redplum.   2. Selling, on or about October 1, 2013, a selection of counterfeit coupons he created entitled ""The Original S.R. Exclusive Coupon Collection!"" for approximately $54.44 to a purchaser located in the District of Columbia via Silk Road 1.0.   3. Finalizing approximately 1228 distinct sales of counterfeit coupons via Silk Road 1.0 for a total price of approximately $37,718.16 between about May 26, 2012, and about May 26, 2013.   4. Finalizing approximately 923 distinct sales of counterfeit coupons via Silk Road 1.0 for a total price of approximately $37,136.92 between about May 26, 2012, and about May 26, 2013.   5. Using the moniker GoldenLotus to send a message via the Silk Road 1.0 chat system to Person A stating:   Take care Yes bud, you take it to Walmart and use the Self Checkout. That's the reason I created that coupon. Can't vouche [sic] for other stores selfcheckouts [sic] but can tell you with certainty it works at Walmart,just dont use any other coupons, and try to catch the atendantet [sic] when they are walking around or busy helping a customer and not stairing [sic] down their screen. I have had no issues though, done it I 0 times in one day myself. (over like 6-7 stores, haha not I 0 at all one place). Only one per transaction, no other coupons ... 450 is the magic number that needs assistance, so $49 .99 is Golden.   GL  All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1349 and 2.  COUNT TWO  (18 U.S.C. Â§2320(a)(4) - Conspiracy to Commit Trademark Counterfeiting)  A.

CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TRADEMARK COUNTERFEITING:  From on or about May 12, 2012, through on or about November 6, 2014, in the Eastern District of Louisiana and elsewhere, BEAU WATTIGNEY willfully, knowingly, and intentionally conspired together with other unidentified coconspirators to traffic in goods and services, and to use a counterfeit mark on and in connection with such goods and services, to wit:  fraudulent coupons for products and services.  All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2320(a)(4), 2320(a)(l), 2320(a)(2), and 2.  NOTICE OF FORFEITURE  1.

Best single quote I've ever read about how LEA ahndles data is this one:   ","*It really sucks; given how long it has been since he retired,*-------It has not been that long.  The fall out from those servers still have years of data and interesting information for LE to decipher.""Sitting ducks"", are probably thousands of users that never used encryption for big orders, multiple orders, and who knows, they might even go after those who just shopped once for a gram of earl?I know I'm one of those sitting ducks, on one account, as a noob, I gave my address in clear txt twice for some illegal goods that came in internationally.  I'm still counting the time from the crime 'till the time they come at me, which so far looks like my health will beat them   but you never know, with quantum computing and shit like that, it might be tomorrow.;One thing I can assure you is that LE never throws away good intel. Every unencrypted name and address that they found on the server is now in a database. So when one of them gets CDed in the future with a fake name, the gov can show the grand jury that that name and address was used in drug buys before. It strengthens the case against them. Sure anybody can send you drugs in the mail. But six times? And you never reported it? You're toast.The thing about infosec and opsec is that you can never erase your mistakes after they happen and you can never erase your history if it falls in LE's hands so you should always practice the best infosec and opsec like they are going to knock on your door tomorrow.                                                                    -- Gumby"

Im planning a personal onion html-based and very simple ""market"" only for offer my products in my country, begining with our city, here are a huge market. The problem is that here no exists that kind of ""postal blue boxes"" (USA) where you can send letters or things just using postage and without interacting with any postal office, the most near thing is buying postage in the office and use it, but i will have to go inside the postal office and let the ""package"" or ""letters"" there (without any signing) and when i purchase the postage, ill have to go inside the postal too, so i dont like it because there are cams, etc.  I was thinking in ""rotatory aleatory in-site drops"" inside the city, like this:  1. The customer see a product, read the sec instructions and make the purchase, sending his EXACTLY AMOUNT BT to our BT adress and the PGP Message with the info, that will be the ""neighborwood"" or some relative geoposition in the city for what we concern.  2. We recieve the BT and message, so we go near to the site he send us (without telling anybody, only me for now and never in exactly the site) and simply locate a site for drop the package, maybe in a trash container, in a wall like an marketing object (i dont know how traslate) or whatever, there just be a lot of possibilitys for make this with a liitle of creativity. If i have been intercepted or contacted by LE, they will never know where i am exactly, only a relative location that will be a lot of surface for cover. Nobody know where is this place, because i ""improvise"" the place ""in site"".  3. We left the place and when have a good and secure distance, send the last message (encrypted) with the exactly location of the package.  So, there always be a distance between me and the customers, in case of LE or something, and always  using correct OpSec and all required security online and offline (surveillance, etc, etc).

It must be easier to do it that way than to drive 100 miles to someone else's neighborhood. Perhaps you can do the drop for customers near by and mail it to those farther away?",""
"The Hub Forums","RC4Every0ne","1885.0","2014-03-11T04:03:26","Alternatives to ""postal smuggling"" for shipping - An personal idea","General Discussion/Security","I think you are over thinking this. I walk into post offices to purchase stamps / postage all the time. My normal non darknet routine involves me going into multiple postal locations frequently. It does not look that unusual for someone to visit the post on a regular basis, and purchase dozens of stamps at one time and do nothing else. When you go to drop off your packages just act calm and normal man. Walk in with all of your packages in a box or a cloth bag to prevent you having to touch them while also avoiding looking odd for wearing gloves in the summer time. For your drop you dont make eye contact with the cameras and wear a hat to make it harder to ID you. You just walk in dump your bag into the bin or casually pour them onto the counter for the PO employee to handle from then. Then just walk out.   Change up which post offices you ship out of and rotate your shipping days. IE pick 2-3 days per week that you will ship orders. Do all your prep early in the day when you can take your time and be very clean about packaging. Make a run to one of the 4-6 post offices you use. After a few months change your days up. So if you were shipping say mon, wed, fri change it up to like tues, fri, sat, or something like that.   Change your appearance so its hard to identify you are the same person each time you make a drop. Changing your hat / general attire slightly helps this. Go get a few outfits that are several sizes too large to use for this. The loose clothing will further obscure your physical description.  It never looks odd for someone to be shipping packages from a post office. People acting sketchy in a post office attracts attention. Just figure out a method that you are comfortable with and practice it. Hell send thank you cards or invitaitons to long lost friends or random people for a couple of runs until you get comfortable with your surroundings. You may even consider continuing this process after you begin shipping your product as again it further obscures your intentions and provides a nice legit reason for you to be in the PO so frequently.  The best of us out there understand that the most effective disguise is to hide in plain sight. My domestic stealth is not the most advanced I have experienced, but at the same time you would NEVER guess my package is what it is without knowing in advance. It looks just like any other random piece of mail. I never use the same exact style of stealth for two drop runs in a row. IE I have about 9 different materials I use to make up my packages. Of those materials I can create up to around 15 unique styles of stealth package. All of them are very plain jane looking on the outside and flat plus the materials I use are fairly inexpensive. This same policy applies to shipping your merchandise. The best way to hide is to look like your not doing anything wrong. Walk in looking pleasant, but in a slight hurry. Its important not to look nervous. Make idle comments to random people in the lobby if you have to wait in line. Keep your conversation mundane and unrevealing.   Be safe out there.",""

New malware found on TOR network?","General Discussion/Security","Hey Guys,   I was doing some work a few nights ago and a set of coincidenses lead me to finding the same behaviour that was written about here: https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=8658 and here: http://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=8671  I contacted the guy who wrote the articles with the following:  I belive that I have stumbled accross the same malware you are describing. I have seen some very strange behavour and managed to reproduce on another machine. I will describe and overview of what happened.  I accessed the Agora market vendor only URL. CPU spiked instantly. Network usage goes through the roof just after the GET request is seen on the PCAP the 200 is not yet returned then the firefox process hangs. event log shows application hang. After this all quiet. Checked the run at startup reg keys for anything odd, services, processes nothing. All appears normal. Up until the machine reboots.  Here is where it gets very strange. First off I boot up tails from USB in order to preserve any data on the machine and so I can take a look at the disks. First clue to something very strange happening is that Tails seems to think that it is now being run in a virtual environment?! I get the alert message ""Warning, Virtual machine detected! that I would expect if I was running Tails on a virtual host... At this point I am panicky and start thinking about the possibility of a firmware ACPI rootkit . I run a PCAP and a few of the classic rootkit revealers.  Next I activate a file monitor an plug in a USB thumb drive, 200MB is written to the disk as soon as it is plugged in. I go to take a look at the directory, disk empty. I look at the disk management tool, the disk is now 256Mb smaller than it was when I plugged it in.. I take a look at the local drive on the infected machine, I compare the results of the disk monitor now to an old log. partition sizes are all the same, but the over all disk size is around 300 megs smaller than it was last week? This has been taken from the unnalocated space. The same behaviour is apparent if I view the traffic on the machine after it goes down for a reboot. From the moment the machine starts up even before launching the tor browser the process obfsproxy keeps on trying to make a connection out. I have removed the machines from the internet but netstat shows it trying to make a connection from as soon as windows loads. Considering I havnt launched tor at this point and considering Iá¸¿ not connected to the internet this is really worrying. Also Whenever I connect a USB drive hidden data is written to it. If I remove the device early I have to format it to be able to use it.    It looks like something was pulled over from the Agora Vendor URL .onion address, it causes the tor browser to hang and installs something in firmware, MBR or hidden partition.  I think this is really worrying, if its the Feds again and this has been installed on many peoples machines then god knows who is at risk. Can anyone verify the same behaviour? Its hard to spot if you are not looking for it. So far I have seen the same thing reproduced on Windows and linyx systems. I have not. It looks like this could be the FBIs next attempt to deanonymise tor users. Any advice to get the machines clean would be great   Ive tried everything short of a low level format.   ACE ",""

Introduction  Stylometry is a form of authorship recognition that relies on the linguistic information found in a document. While stylometry existed before computers and artificial intel- ligence, the field is currently dominated by AI techniques such as neural networks and statistical pattern recognition. Our work opens a new avenue of research in the field of authorship recognition: adversarial stylometry. We find that it is easy for an  untrained individual to modify his or her writing style to protect her identity from being discovered through stylometric analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple methods of stylometry in nonadversarial settings and show that authors at- tempting to modify their writing style can reduce the accuracy of these methods from over 95% to the level of random chance. With this we have demonstrated that cur- rent approaches to stylometry cannot be relied upon in an adversarial setting. It also demonstrated that for individuals seeking anonymity, manual attempts at modifying writing style are promising as a countermeasure against stylometry. We also show that automated attempts at circumventing stylometry using machine translation may not be as effective, often altering the meaning of text while providing only small drops in ac- curacy. We compiled and published the first two corpora of adversarial stylometry data (the Brennan-Greenstadt Adversarial Stylometry Corpus and the Extended-Brennan- Greenstadt Corpus) to allow others to carry out their own research on the impact of adversarial text on new and existing methods of stylometry. Historians and literary detectives have used stylometry with great success to identify the authors of historical documents such as the Federalist Papers, Civil War letters, and ShakespeareÃ¢â¬â¢s plays [Klarreich 2003; Oakes 2004]. The importance of stylometry can be seen through modern applications in the field of forensics, plagiarism, and anonymity. Stylometry is even used as evidence in courts of law in multiple countries including Britain and the United States [Morton and Michaelson 1996]. Ã¢â¬ÅIn some criminal, civil, and security matters, language can be evi- dence. . . When you are faced with a suspicious document, whether you need to know who wrote it, or if it is a real threat or a real suicide note, or if it is too close for comfort to some other document, you need reliable, validated methods.Ã¢â¬Â [The Institute for Linguistic Evidence 2008]  Stylometry has been a successful line of research but there is one underlying assump- tion that has not been widely challenged: that the author of an unknown document has been honest in his or her writing style. We define adversarial stylometry as the notion of applying deception to writing style to affect the outcome of stylometric anal- ysis. This new problem space in the field of stylometry leads to new questions such as what happens when authorship recognition is applied to deceptive writing? Can effective privacy-preserving countermeasures to stylometry be developed? What are the implications of looking at stylometry in an adversarial context? Dr. Patrick Juola, an expert in computer linguistics at Duquesne University, dis- cussed the importance of research in this area in his 2008 monograph on authorship attribution, stating there is obviously great potential for further work here [Juola 2006]. Our research shows that nonexpert human subjects can defeat multiple stylom- etry methods simply by consciously hiding their writing style or imitating the style of another author.  Stylometry is also a necessary new ground for research in privacy and security. Current anonymity and circumvention systems focus strongly on location-based privacy but do not address many avenues for the leakage of identification through the content of data. Writing style as a marker of identity is not addressed in current circumvention tools, nor is it addressed in the security and privacy community at large. Given the high accuracy of even basic stylometry systems this is not a topic that can afford to be overlooked. Our contributions include multiple methods of circumventing author recognition through stylometry and experimental results that show the efficacy of doing so through deceptive writing. We found that the accuracy of all the methods we examined dropped significantly when presented with adversarial passages created by inexperi- enced human adversaries using two of the three circumvention methods. This work  demonstrates the need for testing stylometry techniques in adversarial contexts when the application domain warrants it and a framework (including a publicly available adversarial corpus) for doing so.  Section 2 presents background and related work in stylometry and discusses the implications of stylometry techniques for privacy and anonymity. Section 3 discusses our experimental methodology and presents our three methods for circumventing stylometry. Section 4 presents experimental results of classifying circumvention passages on three representative stylometry techniques and discusses the techniques our human subjects used to modify their writing style. Section 5 discusses implications for future work. ",""

The Role of Stylometry in Privacy and Anonymity A multidisciplinary approach to privacy has long demanded greater attention that includes much more than traditional location-based circumvention and anonymity tools [Adams 2006]. Users of the Internet with the desire to publish anonymously may also desire to hide their writing style to circumvent stylometry techniques. The goal of these authors is to keep their identity private. With the growth of stylometry as an accurate means of determining authorship, the question of how it affects privacy and anonymity in the information age is becoming increasingly important. Privacy and anonymity are held in high regard by many activists, journalists, and law enforcement officers. The introduction of adversarial stylometry and the use of circumvention pas- sages on stylometry are possible means of ensuring the privacy and anonymity of an individual. The largest example of the value of anonymous speech to these groups is the Tor Project, an anonymous communication tool originally developed by the Naval Research Laboratory that is utilized by hundreds of thousands of individuals including law enforcement, journalists, activists, businesses, and more [The Tor Project 2012a, 2012b].  The privacy issues concerning stylometry can be summarized through an example scenario: Alice the anonymous blogger versus Bob the abusive employer: Alice is an employee at BobÃ¢â¬â¢s company, the Widget Design Corporation. Alice, a long-time em- ployee, wishes to draw attention to the various systemic abuses that she has observed at the company under BobÃ¢â¬â¢s management such as harassment, unpaid overtime, and employees being encouraged to rip off competing widget designers. She decides to do this by publishing an open anonymous letter on the Web she has personally authored detailing these abuses. She takes great care to use privacy enhancing technologies as outlined by Dr. Rao and Dr. Rohatgi so that it is very difficult if not impossible to trace her post back to her identity or her IP address [Rao and Rohatgi 2000]. The letter draws criticism of the company from the press, and Bob decides to discover the author, believing it came from within his company due to the details it revealed. In this case, BobÃ¢â¬â¢s company has about 100 employees. If Bob has access to a stylometry system such as Writeprints that has very high accuracy for large numbers of potential authors [Abbasi and Chen 2008], he can collect 6500 words from each employeeÃ¢â¬â¢s writing (probably though various reports and emails that they have written in their time at the company) and come to believe that Alice is the writer of the document with over 90% probability. He can then take action against Alice that may compromise her job.  This hypothetical scenario represents a reasonable threat that is within the range of ability for current methods of stylometry. However, the threat presented to anonymity is not purely hypothetical. In his 2011 book,Inside Wikileaks, former Wikileaks spokesman Daniel Domscheitt-Berg discussed the potential impact of stylometry on the organization after attending a presentation on adversarial stylometry at the 26th Chaos Communication Congress.  Ã¢â¬ÅIf someone had run WikiLeaks documents through such a program, he would have discovered that the same two people were behind all the vari- ous press releases, document summaries, and correspondence issued by the project. The official number of volunteers we had was also, to put it mildly, grotesquely exaggerated.Ã¢â¬Â [Domscheit-Berg et al. 2011] The reality of using stylometry to identify individuals who wish to remain anonymous can also be seen from the perspective of law enforcement. It is high- lighted in the recently commissioned FBI report State-of-the-Art Biometric Excellence Roadmap (SABER).  Ã¢â¬ÅAs non-handwritten communications become more prevalent, such as blog- ging, text messaging and emails, there is a growing need to identify writ- ers not by their written script, but by analysis of the typed content. Cur- rently, there are some studies in the area of writerÃâs colloquial analysis that may lead to the emerging technology of writer identification in the blogosphere.Ã¢â¬Â [Colosimo et al. 2009] Recent work by the authors of this article examines the domain of deception and writing style in real-world scenarios like the Ã¢â¬ÅGay Girl in DamascusÃ¢â¬Â blog in which an American writer masqueraded as a Syrian woman. This fraudulent blog was uncovered through forensic means but this research shows that stylometry demonstrates a strong correlation between the pseudonymous blog and writing samples by the true identity of the author [Afroz et al. 2012]. The technical ability for a method of stylometry to present such a threat to anonymity is explained in the next section. The methodology used in Writeprints in particular has demonstrated the potential for identifying a single author among up to 100 unique identities. As a result, bloggers and others may have reason to circumvent stylometry to protect their privacy and anonymity. Adversarial stylometry can be viewed in this way as a means for maintaining privacy or anonymity.",""

The Brennan-Greenstadt and Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt Corpora  We have published two freely available research corpora. The first is the Brennan- Greenstadt corpus, which is based on a survey conducted through Drexel University and contains 12 authors who volunteered their time and were not compensated for their efforts. This corpus was the basis for our original work on adversarial stylome- try [Brennan and Greenstadt 2009]. The second is the Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt corpus containing 45 authors solicited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Submissions were vetted against a series of guidelines to ensure the quality of the content, as described next.  3.2.1. Brennan-Greenstadt Corpus. Participants for the Brennan-Greenstadt corpus were solicited through classes at Drexel University, colleagues, and other personal relationships. This provided us with submissions from 12 authors. The Brennan- Greenstadt corpus used an earlier version of the survey which had two relaxed re- quirements. Authors were only required to submit 5000 words of preexisting writing and they were not required to fill out a demographic survey. While this corpus was sufficient for preliminary results presented in earlier work [Brennan and Greenstadt 2009], we desired a more robust corpus in order to confirm our original findings in a larger author space with a greater diversity of writ- ers and tweaked survey requirements. 3.2.2. Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt Corpus. We utilized the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform to create a large and diverse corpus that could be used for more robust analysis. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a platform that provides access to a large and diverse population that is willing to perform human intelligence tasks. Participants choose tasks that they would like to complete in exchange for a sum of money decided by a task creator. Submission quality is a serious consideration when using the AMT platform as the completion of a task does not necessarily indicate that the worker has followed the directions and completed it correctly. In order to ensure that the submissions were acceptable we reviewed every submission and judged their acceptability by scrutinizing them according to the guidelines and requirements listed on the submission form. We only removed authors from the dataset who did not adhere to the directions of the survey. We did not remove authors because of the quality of their writing, demographic information, or anything other than their ability to follow directions. In addition to the existing requirements we published four guidelines that submis- sions should adhere to.        (1) The submitted preexisting writing was to be Ã¢â¬ÅscholarlyÃ¢â¬Â in nature (i.e., a persuasive piece, opinion paper, research paper, journals, etc.).       (2) Anything that is not the writing content of the work should be removed (i.e., cita- tions, urls, section headings, editing notes, etc.).       (3) The papers/samples should have a minimal amount of dialog/quotations.       (4) Please refrain from submitting samples of less than 500 words, laboratory and other overly scientific reports, Q&A-style samples such as exams, and anything written in another personÃ¢â¬â¢s style.  As an added incentive for authors to take care with their submissions we offered a bonus payment of two dollars on top of an original payment of three dollars if their submission adhered to the quality guidelines. Of the 100 submissions we received, 45 satisfied the requirements of the survey. These 45 submissions make up the Extended- Brennan-Greenstadt adversarial stylometry corpus and are the basis of the evaluation for this research. It took about one hour on average for a participant to finish the complete task. The entire instruction set for participation is available online. ",""

Support Vector Machine and the Writeprints-Static Approach.  Writeprints is one of the most successful methods of stylometry that has been published to date because of its high levels of accuracy on a range of datasets with large numbers of unique authors. Unfortunately this accuracy comes at a high computation cost. In order to perform the robust experiments we designed for this study we have created our own approx- imation of the Writeprints algorithm that performs comparably but has much lower computation cost that allows us to run large numbers of experiments in a reasonable timeframe. We will summarize the Writeprints method and highlight the feature sets created for this approach and how we merged those feature sets into our approach. The Writeprints technique constructs a single classifier using feature sets that are specific to each individual author rather than being generalized across the set of po- tential authors. The method has two major parts: writeprint creation and pattern disruption. The writeprint creation step constructs n-dimensional hyperplanes that represent an individual authorÃ¢â¬â¢s writing style, where ""n"" is the number of features in the feature set. The pattern disruption step identifies zero usage features and shifts the writeprint representation further away from writeprints that have nonzero values for the same features which in turn decreases the level of stylistic similarity between two separate authors. There are many nuances to this approach that we will not discuss here but are described in detail in the original research paper on Writeprints. One of the most valuable pieces of research that has come from the creation of Writeprints are the baseline and extended feature sets [Abbasi and Chen 2008].   The baseline dataset has 327 features whereas the extended set contains tens of thousands. The primary difference between these two datasets, however, is that the baseline set contains only  static features in that the contents do not change with the addition and removal of documents. The extended feature set contains many elements that are based on the documents being classified, and is much larger as a consequence. Examples of these dynamic features are the most common misspellings and character bigrams in the corpus. We used many pieces of the feature set created by Writeprints. To mitigate the issue of WriteprintsÃ¢â¬â¢ high computation cost we have combined a hybrid version of the Writeprints feature sets with a support vector machine. This results in a faster method that has a higher, but comparable, precision on our cor- pus. We validated the effectiveness of this approach by comparing it to the original Writeprints approach for select datasets from the original Brennan-Greenstadt corpus and found that the precision of our approach is comparable to the precision of the com- plete Writeprints method, as can be seen in Figure 2. This is also in line with results from the original Writeprints research which compared the approach with a variety of others, including SVMs using the same feature set.  The feature set we use combines the brevity and static nature of the baseline set with some of the more complex features of the extended set. We call this the Writeprints Static feature set. It contains 557 static features, detailed in Table II. We applied this feature set to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in the form of a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) with a polynomial kernel using Weka machine learning software. ",""

Obfuscation and Imitation Circumvention Approaches  Attempting to recognize the authors of the obfuscation passages results in a drop of ac- curacy to around that of chance classification as can be seen in Figure 7. Only the SVM (Writeprints Static) approach displayed an effectiveness above that of random chance.  This demonstrates the weakness of these methods in detecting writing style designed to be adversarial. The fact that the obfuscated passages track closely to random chances is exactly what we would expect for well-constructed obfuscation passages. Imitation passages demonstrated a significant drop in effectiveness beyond the obfuscation approach for the neural-network-and SVM-based approaches, and main- tainedchance-levelaccuracyforWriteprintsandthesynonym-basedmethodsasisseen in Figure 8. The lower-than-chance results for SVM and neural network approaches demonstrates a difference in how resistant different methods are to adversarial pas- sages. This might indicate that the features modified in attempting to imitate Cormac McCarthy are well represented in the Basic-9 feature set but not so much by the extensive Writeprints Static feature set or the specific but unique synonym analysis. Furthermore the ability of the imitation passages to successfully imitate Cormac McCarthy was high. This is demonstrated in Figure 9. The synonym-based approach, despite very high precision in the baseline tests, was just as susceptible to misclassifica- tion of imitation passages towards Cormac McCarthy as the neural network approach that it greatly outperformed in the baseline evaluation.  It is important to note that the testing of imitation success required a modification to the evaluation process. In order to test for the success of an imitation passage in representing Cormac McCarthyÃ¢â¬â¢s writing styles we needed to include training texts for Cormac McCarthy when building the classifier. This is only done for the measurement of imitation success; no Cormac McCarthy text is used in the training process for any other tests. While stylometry methods that are resistant to adversarial passages have been hy- pothesized [Brennan and Greenstadt 2009; Juola and Vescovi 2010], we can see the first true instance of it here with the results from the SVM approach. The precision when classifying obfuscation passages never drops below that of random chance. Further- more it can be considered resistant to wrongly classifying imitation passages as their intended target as it generally is only half as likely as the other methods to classify an imitation passage as having been written by Cormac McCarthy. It is likely, however, that more sophisticated circumvention methods could pose a more significant threat to this approach.",""

Adjusting Writing Style In informal discussions with participants after completing the study, we found that many of them tried to obfuscate their style by Ã¢â¬Ådumbing downÃ¢â¬Â their writing by us- ing shorter sentences and less descriptive words. When imitating the writing style of Cormac McCarthy the participants described attempting to use descriptive and grim language. We can verify at least some of these claims through analysis of the feature frequency changes in the obfuscation and imitation passages. We compare the normalized frequencies of the features to understand which ones people change to hide their writing style. The changes made to a selection of features for both obfuscation and imitation passages can be seen in Figure 12. This graph illustrates the changes in frequencies for each feature. The y-axis contains a list of features that have been adjusted in the passages and x-axis of the graph denotes the change in each feature. We compute the change in feature using the following formula.   Change in Feature f, Cf=100Ã¢Ëâ(fadvÃ¢Ëâfreg)/(freg+1) where fadv=Average values of feature F in adversarial documents.  freg=Average values of feature F in regular documents.  We add one with freg in the denominator to avoid divide-by-zero error, as freg can be zero for some features. The amount to the right of the y-axis represents the increases in a feature and the amount to the left represents the decreases. In our experiments, the most changed features are average syllables, average word length, sentence count, average sentence length, usage of personal pronouns, adjec- tives, and verbs, and readability index. We do see hints that authors are Ã¢â¬Ådumbing downÃ¢â¬Â their writing style with shorter sentences, lower readability scores, and less complex words. Most of these are the features in our Basic-9 feature set which may explain why that feature set can be effective despite its relatively small size. In imitation passages, all the participants use more personal pronouns and verbs and shorter sentences than the regular cases. The personal pronouns can likely be attributed to the direction of the writing survey which asked participants to describe their day in the third person. The shorter sentences, however, are likely a result of imitating Cormac McCarthy who often uses short sentences in his prose. In both imitation and obfuscation passages, participants use shorter and simpler words (those with only one or two syllables) and shorter sentences. As a result, adversarial writings are easier to read than regular writings.",""

CONCLUSION  This study demonstrates the effectiveness of adversarial writing against modern meth- ods of stylometry. The analysis of stylometry techniques and their weaknesses to adver- sarial writing demonstrates that we must test stylometry methods for their resistance to adversaries in situations where their presence is likely. We advocate a stronger stance of not relying on stylometry in sensitive situations where the authorship of an unknown document must be known with a high degree of certainty unless the possi- bility of a modified writing style is negligible.  The obfuscation approach weakens all methods to the point that they are no better than randomly guessing the correct author of a document. The imitation approach was widely successful in causing authorship to be attributed to the intended imitation target. Additionally, these passages were generated by participants in very short peri- ods of time by amateur writers who lacked expertise in stylometry. Translation with widely available machine translation services does not appear to be a viable mode of circumvention. Our evaluation did not demonstrate sufficient anonymization and the translated document has, at best, questionable grammar and quality.  There has long been a case to be made for a multidisciplinary approach to privacy and anonymity. This research shows both the necessity of considering writing-style analysis as a component of that approach and demonstrates the possibility for privacy- conscious individuals to take steps to maintain their anonymity in the face of advanced stylometric techniques.  This work provides further evidence that learning techniques used in adversarial settings need to be tested with adversarial test sets. This research also has implica- tions for machine translation research through the use of stylometry as a method for testing the effectiveness of machine translation. If a machine translated dataset shows comparable accuracy in an adversarial stylometry setting then the results may be used to validate the translation method.  This study also strengthens the original claims of high accuracies by validating the methods on a large set of new data produced for a variety of purposes. When these methods are used in situations where adversaries are not considered to be a threat, they perform quite well.

BACKGROUND, RELATED WORK AND MOTIVATION Stylometry is based on the assumption that every individual has a unique style to his or her writing to some degree just as every individual has a unique fingerprint. The most famous early example of this assumption being put into practice with stylometry is the classic case of the Federalist Papers. Eighty-five papers were published anonymously in the late 18th century to persuade the people of New York to ratify the American Constitution. The authorship of 12 of these papers was heavily contested [Oakes 2004]. To discover who wrote the unknown papers, researchers have analyzed the writing styles of the known Federalist authors and compared them to the papers of unknown authorship. The features used to determine writing styles have been quite varied. Original attempts looked at the length of words, whereas later attempts looked at pairs of words, vocabulary usage, sentence structure, function words, and so on. Most studies show the author was James Madison.  Recent work in stylometry has been geared towards high accuracy in larger and more diverse datasets. Writeprints is a method that has demonstrated superiority over all other modern stylometry techniques because of its ability to categorize large corpora that include 25 to 100 unique authors in many different contexts including online chat messages, eBay comments, email messages [Abbasi and Chen 2008]. It is an unsupervised method that can be used for both authorship recognition of known authors and similarity detection among unknown authored documents. This approach is significant in the field of stylometry because of its use of individual author-level feature sets and pattern disruption and also because of its high accuracy in authorship recognition. Stylometry has played a serious role in forensics over the years, especially in the 1990s with the introduction of the cumulative sum, or cusum, technique. This method measures the stability of a specific feature throughout multiple documents to establish authorship and was adopted in many court cases, specifically in England. But the accuracy of cusum came under fire, culminating in massive controversy about the use of the technique [Matthews 1993]. It has since been modified with better accuracy that has been supported by researchers but questions of accuracy are still considered by some to be the biggest problem faced by the field [Juola 2006].  A number of resources are available that give an overview of stylometry methods that exist [Malyutov 2006; Uzuner and Katz 2005], and focus on the state of the field as it relates to computer science and computer linguistics [Juola 2006] or digital foren- sics [Chaski 2005]. Artificial Intelligence has been embraced in the field of stylometry, leading to more robust classifiers using machine learning and other AI techniques [Tweedie et al. 1996; Holmes and Forsyth 1995; Uzuner and Katz 2005]. Early work in the field we now call adversarial stylometry includes research by Dr. Josyula Rao and Dr. Pankaj Rohatgi studying the impact of stylometry on pseudonymity and determining that 6500 words of writing is enough to leak the identity of an author [Rao and Rohatgi 2000]. Others have looked at the potential of automatically obfuscating a document to preserve anonymity and determined that in the case of the Federalist Papers it took just 14 changes per 1000 words to shift authorship from Madison to Hamilton [Kacmarcik and Gamon 2006]. This work, however, does not modify the actual text in the documents. They instead modified the numerical feature vectors after they have been extracted from the original text. Previous research in the field has also looked at authorship recognition and pastiche by comparing the work of Gilbert Adair to that of Lewis Caroll, whom he was trying to imitate by writing follow-up stories to Alice in Wonderland [Somers and Tweedie 2003]. However, our work is the first to apply adversarial stylometry to actual docu- ments written by humans to defeat stylometry and test the results against multiple methods and features sets. Patrick Juola validated the effectiveness of adversarial writing on stylometry by evaluating the Brennan-Greenstadt corpus with JGAAP and also demonstrated some methodsÃ¢â¬â¢ resistance to such writing samples [Juola and Vescovi 2010]",""

METHODOLOGY We collected writing samples from human subjects that represented both their unmodi- fied writing style and attempts to create adversarial passages to circumvent stylometry methods. We identified three methods of creating documents to circumvent stylometry, two of which are written by human subjects and one of which is an automated method. We implemented three methods of stylometry to analyze the effect of these adversarial passages by attempting to recognize the original author. The next section explains our method for creating a survey and collecting the data required for the unique adversarial corpus upon which this study was based. We then detail the three types of circumvention passages that have been examined in this study. Finally we summarize the implementation of each method used in the study and their corresponding feature sets.  3.1. Study Setup and Format While there are a virtually limitless number of corpora with known author information that can be used for stylometry research, we had to develop our own unique corpus for evaluating the effects of adversarial passages. This was necessary because in addition to a large number of texts from unique authors we also needed adversarial texts written by those same authors. The collection of this data was performed through the use of a survey by voluntary participants of various backgrounds, though all participants held at least some college education. The Brennan-Greenstadt adversarial stylometry corpus is freely available.  There were three basic elements for participation in the survey. First, each author had to submit at least 6500 words of preexisting sample writing. Each writing sample had to be from some sort of formal source, such as essays for school, reports for work, and other professional and academic correspondence. This was intended to eliminate slang and abbreviations, instead concentrating on consistent, formal writing style of everyone involved. This also helped to limit possible errors that are not a result of the malicious attempts but nonetheless could have an effect on the accuracy of the authorship attribution. Participants submitted at least two sample documents, with a median submission of 5 documents per author, which were combined and split into approximately 500-word sample passages.  Second, each author had to write an obfuscation passage in which he tried to hide his identity through his writing style. This was accomplished by writing a new 500-word passage on a specific topic. The task given to them was to write a description of their neighborhood to someone who has never been there as part of a college application. This task was designed to encourage thought about the writing style and not weigh down the author with having to think about a complex topic or be too creative with her content.  Third, each author had to write an imitation passage in which she tries to imitate another authorÃ¢â¬â¢s style. For this task the participants were given a 2500-word sample from The Road by Cormac McCarthy to model their passage after. This selection was made for a variety of reasons. Imitation and pastiche is a common writing task, as can be seen through contest such as the International Hemingway Imitation Competition and the Faux Faulkner contest [Afroz et al. 2012]. In addition, Cormac McCarthy has a somewhat distinct writing style. Ã¢â¬ÅOn the far side of the river valley the road passed through a stark black burn. Charred and limbless trunks of trees stretching away on every side. Ash moving over the road and the sagging hands of blind wire strung from the blackened lightpoles whining thinly in the wind.Ã¢â¬Â [McCarthy 2008] Since the participants are not professional writers this would allow them to make a fair attempt at emulating another style. The popularity of the book was also a factor in its selection for this study as we wanted to engage participants with reading samples that had broad appeal to a variety of readers. In engaging participants we sought more effort in writing passages and thus more robust results. The writing task given to participants was to narrate their day from the point at which they get out of bed, and to do so using a third-person perspective. This is also similar to the events in the sample text. For testing purposes an additional 2500 words were taken from The Road and used as training text for Cormac McCarthy along with the original sample. It should also be noted that the excerpt distributed to readers is freely available as a promotional passage from the book.  Asking the participants to write the obfuscation passages before the imitation pas- sage was intentional. We were concerned that if participants chose to write the imita- tion passage first then all of the obfuscation passages would simply read as a second Cormac McCarthy imitation attempt.",""

Circumventing Stylometry  We developed three methods of circumvention against stylometry techniques in the form of obfuscation, imitation, and machine translation passages. Two of these, obfus- cation and imitation, were manually written by human subjects. These passages were very effective at circumventing attempts at authorship recognition. Machine trans- lation passages are automated attempts at obfuscation utilizing machine translation services. These passages were not sufficient in obfuscating the identity of an author. The full results and effectiveness of these circumvention methods are detailed in the evaluation section.  3.3.1. Obfuscation. In the obfuscation approach the author attempts to write a docu- ment in such a way that her personal writing style will not be recognized. There is no guidance for how to do this and there is no specific target for the writing sample. An ideal obfuscated document would be difficult to attribute to any author. For our study, however, we only look at whether or not it successfully deters recognition of the true author.  3.3.2. Imitation. The imitation approach is when an author attempts to write a docu- ment such that her writing style will be recognized as that of another specific author. The target is decided upon before a document is written and success is measured both by how successful the document is in deterring authorship recognition systems and how successful it is in imitating the target author. This could also be thought of as a Ã¢â¬ÅframingÃ¢â¬Â attack.  3.3.3. Machine Translation. The machine translation approach translates an unmodified passage written in english to another language, or to two other languages, and then back to english. Our hypothesis was that this would sufficiently alter the writing style and obfuscate the identity of the original author. We did not find this to be the case. We studied this problem through a variety of translation services and languages. We measured the effectiveness of the translation as an automated method as well as the accuracy of the translation in producing comprehensible, coherent obfuscation passages.  We performed three language experiments in addition to the English baseline. In all cases the original and final language were English. We performed single-step transla- tions from English to German and back to English as well as English to Japanese and back to English. We then performed two-step translations from English to German to Japanese and then back to English. German was chosen for its linguistic similarities to English and Japanese for its differences.  The two machine translation services we compared were Google Translate and Bing Translator. Both services are free and based on statistical machine translation.  3.4. Methods and Feature Sets We selected a series of stylometry techniques that represent a variety of potential approaches both in machine learning methodology and feature selection. The feature selections range from basic to comprehensive and the methods from simple and novel to robust and unique (see Table I).  3.4.1. Neural Network and the Basic-9 Feature Set. The most straightforward stylometry techniques are those that use traditional machine learning methods with some set of linguistic features [Kacmarcik and Gamon 2006; Rao and Rohatgi 2000]. The effec- tiveness of neural networks [Tweedie et al. 1996] in stylometry established machine learning as an integral part of modern authorship analysis.We implemented a neural network with a simple, straightforward feature set. The purpose of the simple fea- ture set and basic machine learning approach is to demonstrate the effectiveness of stylometry even with a limited representation of something as complex as writing style. The features used for the neural network and SVM classifiers, which we will call the Ã¢â¬ÅBasic-9Ã¢â¬Â feature set, include nine linguistic measurements: number of unique words, lexical density, Gunning-Fog readability index, character count without whitespace, average syllables per word, sentence count, average sentence length, and the Flesch- Kincaid Readability Test. The number of hidden layers in the neural network classifier was based on the number of features and the number of classes: ( number of features+number of classes)  2. The feature extraction for this set was done with the JStylo tool.  3.4.2. Synonym-Based Approach. Developed by Clark and Hannon, the synonym-based approach demonstrates the continuing value of novel techniques in stylometry. This method exploits the choice of a specific word given all the possible alternatives that exist. The theory behind this method is that when a word has a large number of synonyms, the choice the author makes is significant in understanding his or her writing style [Clark and Hannon 2007]. An example analysis of three sentences can be seen in Figure 1. The synonym-based approach represents the potential effectiveness of using a single type of feature vector for stylometric analysis. The method called for a vocabulary-based feature set. A feature vector is created for each word ""w"" in a text, having two elements: the number of synonyms ""s"" that the word has according to PrincetonÃ¢â¬â¢s WordNet lexical database [Miller 1995], and the shared frequency ""n"" of the word ""w"" between the sample text and the training text of a known author. The match value for a sample text ""u"" from an unknown author and a reference text ""k"" from a known author is then the sum of ""n"" x ""s"" for all shared words between the two texts. Authorship is attributed to a text based on the known author with the highest match value to the sample text. The method also takes into account the overall frequency of a word in all of the available text as well as removing words that appear on a stop-list of the 319 most common words in the English language. A sample text is attributed to the author with the highest match value over all samples from that author.",""

EVALUATION  There are two ways to think of Ã¢â¬ÅsuccessÃ¢â¬Â when evaluating how stylometric methods respond to adversarial writing samples. One way is to measure the success of the method in identifying the true author of a document intended to circumvent stylometry and the other is to measure the success of the circumvention passage in preserving the anonymity of the author. We will examine the results from both angles. To test the success we look at the performance on different sets of unique authors. Our dataset consisted of a total of 45 unique authors. This is a larger number of unique authors than almost all of stylometry studies cited throughout this article and is in line with the current state-of-the-art, Writeprints, which looked at writing samples of 25, 50, and 100 unique authors.  In order to evaluate the corpus we set up test sets for 1000 unique sets of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 authors out of a total sample pool of 45 authors from the Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt corpus. The precision measurement discussed for any author count throughout this section refers to the average across all 1000 sets. All of the baseline results are based on tenfold cross-validation. The precision for classifying obfuscation, imitation, and translation passages is measured by training each classifier on the entire unmodified corpus for the authors in a test set and testing that classifier on the corresponding circumvention passages. The graphs in this article refer to the precision because we believe that is the most important and intuitive measurement when determining the authorship of an individual, unknown document. We have made additional graphs available reflecting recall and f-measure on our Web site.  The high number of combinations is uncommon in stylometry research but we believe  it is important. Accuracy between different sets of authors can vary significantly depending on the specific authors chosen. By viewing the potential combinations of au- thors as the sample space and a specific combination of authors as a sample selection we are able to make robust accuracy claims with minimal standard error. Standard error in this case is 3.1%.  4.1. Evaluating the Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt Corpus  In order to substantiate the results we present in this article as being in line with our previous work we evaluated all of the methods presented in this work on our original dataset, the Brennan-Greenstadt corpus. We utilized the author counts available in our original paper given the smaller dataset. We found that the precision for each approach is comparable on all datasets. The Basic-9 neural network approach saw a slight drop as can be seen in Figure 3. The others were nearly identical as seen with the Writeprints Static approach in Figure 5 and the synonym based approach in Figure 4.  4.2. Baseline  Figure 6 demonstrates the effectiveness of the four methods we tested and the accuracy of random chance classification. The random chance line in all figures represents what the precision would be if the authorship of a document was determined by randomly selecting one of the potential authors. All of the results for the baseline precision mea- surements are statistically significant over random chance. All methods show a degra- dation of precision as the number of unique authors increases but the effectiveness is still quite substantial at even the largest author set. The Writeprints Static feature set utilizing an SVM demonstrates the highest precision overall. The synonym-based approach is also very effective. The Basic-9 feature set does poorly compared to the other two methods, but is still far above that of random chance. This is important and confirms our hypothesis that even a very simple measurement of writing style is effective for small numbers of authors and still demonstrates significant ability for deanonymization with larger numbers of authors.  Our SVM approach was evaluated using tenfold cross-validation in the same manner as the rest of our experiments. This is more robust than the approach utilized by the Writeprints authors. In addition, the amount of training data available per author is much lower in our dataset than most of the sets used in the Writeprints research. Our classification is based on approximately 6500 words per author (we allow for error within 250 words of 6500 in order to not break-up sentences) as opposed to anywhere from 23,000 to 43,000 in most datasets used in the Writeprints study. These points are important because while our method does not achieve the same levels of precision at the Writeprints approach, it still approaches those numbers despite the relaxed constraints of our evaluation.  The neural network approach displays accuracies varying between 63% and 25%. This is not as effective as the other approaches but is high enough to be an effective form of authorship recognition and a legitimate threat to privacy and anonymity. The synonym-based approach, however, performs exceedingly well even at higher num- bers of unique authors. The degradation in precision follows the same decline as the Writeprints Static feature set approach.  The synonym and Writeprints Static approaches follow a smooth degradation curve as the number of authors in each set increases. This confirms hypotheses of our orig- inal research that the degradation curve we observed using the original Brennan- Greenstadt corpus would extend to larger numbers of authors.  ",""

Circumvention by Machine Translation  Since publication of our initial 2009 research on this topic, circumvention via machine translation has been consistently questioned as a possible approach to maintaining anonymity. Our evaluation suggests that machine translation in its current form does not provide a reliable means of circumventing stylometry.  The translation evaluation was performed using passages from the Brennan- Greenstadt corpus. The single-step translations provided a drop in precision of any- where from 10% to 30%. The two-step translation caused drops from 30% to 60%. Generally, Bing was better at discerning authorship after Japanese translations and Google was better with German translations. Bing, however, performed very poorly with the two-step translations described shortly. We found that the synonym method was especially resistant to these passages and the neural network and SVM methods performed similarly throughout.  4.4.1. One-Step Translations. One-step translations to and from German and Japanese were generally not effective at hiding the writing style of an author. While there was a reduction and it was sometimes statistically significant, such as Bing translations from English to German to Japanese to English on neural network and SVM classifiers, the drop in accuracy is not large enough to grant much comfort to those looking to maintain their anonymity as it generally only decreases the chance of identification from about 65% to about 50% in SVM and neural network approaches and only from 85% to 75% in the case of the synonym-based method. These numbers are not strong enough to warrant a claim that they are effective in providing an anonymizing effect on a document.  4.4.2. Two-StepTranslations. Two-steptranslationsfromEnglishtoGermantoJapanese and then back to English were generally no more effective at hiding the writing style of an author than a one-step translation with Japanese except for the case of Bing Translator using SVMs and neural networks as is explained next.  4.4.3. Translation Service Comparison. Single-step translation approaches to and from German were less effective using Google Translate and Japanese translations were less effective on Bing Translator. Bing seemed to produce very effective two-step translation passages for the NN and SVM methods. Overall it appears as though BingÃ¢â¬â¢s ability to construct adversarial passages well from an accuracy standpoint is greater than Google Translate. BingÃ¢â¬â¢s average accuracy across correctly identifying adversarial translation passages is 12 points lower than Google and when the especially effective synonym- based method is removed the difference increases to 17 points. This would indicate Bing is better for attempting a machine translation-based circumvention approach but overall the accuracies are still not low enough to suggest it would be sufficient to protect privacy and anonymity.  4.4.4. Classifier Method Comparison. The most effective of the three for all experiments as well as the baseline was the synonym-based method. This method was demonstrated to have high accuracy in past work but there is no previous work indicating that accuracy persists when looking at larger numbers of unique authors until now. The baseline of 84.5% for the synonym-based method was the highest of the three classifiers. The SVM and neural network using the Basic-9 feature set had baseline accuracies of 65.1% and 65.9%, respectively.  Using Google Translate the synonym-based method maintained an accuracy of 84.8% for Japanese and 80.5% for German one-step translations. The accuracy dropped only to 75% for the two-step translation. Similar results were found with the Bing Trans- lator. The SVM and neural network methods dropped to 46% and 44.4% for Japanese, respectively, and 50.1% and 58.7% for German. They also saw accuracies similar to Japanese one-step translations for the two-step translation experiment.  Overall these results are, for the most part, not statistically significant in favor of the translation having an anonymizing effect on the writing style of an author and we believe the reduction in accuracy is not enough to warrant calling this an effective approach to circumventing stylometry.  4.4.5. Effectiveness of Translated Documents. Even if we were to accept a drop in accuracy by 15 to 35 points as sufficient for aiding the anonymization of a document, would the resulting translated passage be acceptable for communication purposes or publication? We observed that the answer to this question depends heavily on the complexity of the language being translated. Here is an example sentence from Cormac McCarthy that appeared in his novel The Road, along with each translation.  (Original) Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever, he said.  (EnglishÃ¢â¡âGermanÃ¢â¡âEnglish) Remember that the things that you are dead set on always there, he said.  (EnglishÃ¢â¡âJapaneseÃ¢â¡âEnglish) But things are there forever remember what you put in your head, he said.  (EnglishÃ¢â¡âGermanÃ¢â¡âJapaneseÃ¢â¡âEnglish) You are dead, that there always is set, please do not forget what he said.  The original sentence was reasonably complex and did not fare well through the translation process. While the translated sentences were coherent, the meaning was fundamentally changed in each one. But when we look at a simpler sentence from that same passage we find more consistent results.  (Original) They passed through the city at noon of the day following.  (EnglishÃ¢â¡âGermanÃ¢â¡âEnglish) They crossed the city at noon the following day.  (EnglishÃ¢â¡âJapaneseÃ¢â¡âEnglish) They passed the city at noon the following day.  (EnglishÃ¢â¡âGermanÃ¢â¡âJapaneseÃ¢â¡âEnglish) They crossed the city at noon the next day.  The translations of the simpler sentence are more effective but lack obfuscation. The goal of the translation approach is to alter the writing style while retaining the meaning. There are many examples of this that can be found in the translated passages, such as Ã¢â¬ÅFighting was tough, with each house and factory fiercely contested.Ã¢â¬Â being translated to Ã¢â¬ÅThe fight was hard, fought hard with every home and factory.Ã¢â¬Â But these are outweighed by the number of significantly altered meanings, incoherent translations, and very good but nonobfuscated translations.",""

Authors, Topics and Skill The amount of training text for each author is not exceptionally large, but the total number of authors in the study is significantly larger than most studies of stylometry methods and on par with new methods such as Writeprints. Having such a large number of authors to work with allowed us to do more extensive testing by choosing random groups of authors and averaging the accuracies across them. This also allowed us to see interesting patterns in the study such as which authors did a better job than others in creating successful adversarial passages. Through our anecdotal observations it was clear that certain authors did a poor job in writing their adversarial passages. Additionally, certain authors also had a style that seemed to be particularly suscepti- ble to obfuscation attempts. Authorship of obfuscation passages were often attributed to these authors when they were a member of a test set. An interesting avenue of research would be to determine if it is possible to create a generic writing style by automated means. The domain of possible content in this study was fairly open. Participants were allowed to present samples from a variety of subjects so long as they were scholarly in nature. It could be beneficial to study the effects of adversarial attacks in stricter domains where there is less room for maneuvering and thus less options for how an author could hide his or her identity. Stylometry used in restricted domains may prove less susceptible to our attacks. In general the participants in this study were unskilled in the field of stylometry and were not professional writers. Despite this lack of expertise they were able to consistently circumvent the authorship attribution methods that were put in place. This strengthens our findings as it would be reasonable to expect authors with expertise in such areas could do a better job at attacking the system.  5.2. Open Problems in Adversarial Stylometry Given the evidence in this research that hiding oneÃ¢â¬â¢s writing style is an effective means to circumventing authorship recognition, one of the next logical steps is to develop end- user software that can assist users in modifying their writing. This is being addressed with the release of Anonymouth.  Anonymouth augments the writing-style modifica- tion process with intelligent suggestions driven by implementations and analysis of stylometry techniques outlined in this research and elsewhere. Open research avenues include identifying the most effective structured approach for writing-style modifica- tion, resolving the trade-off between comprehensive modification and overfitting the changes for specific recognition methods, and identifying which features may be heavily automated and which must rely greatly on manual input.  Another important part of continued research in this area is larger and more defined corpora in different languages. Our general corpus satisfies a number of reasonable demands for consistency, length, and focus but there are many other more specific domains that could produce different results when examining adversarial passages. For example, will writing style modifications be more or less effective in a highly restricted domain such as complex scientific research papers or in a very broad domain such as fictional short stories? Are the most salient features for identification in other languages similar to those in English?",""

AFTER you have downloaded AND launched TOR browser bundle, connect to AirVPN with SOCKS proxy option activated.

Hydra, for instance, only cares about the server and protocol. Tor sites are built using html, so it will work. All the html form fuzzing tools will work fine.  I always do my bruting through tor anyway, even on clearnet sites, as it makes it harder to know where the attempts are coming from. Just set Hydra to use tor as a socks proxy. (default: 127.0.0.1, port 9150).  All TCP/IP scans work as well. Tor uses TCP/IP. However, it filters out ICMP, so ping scans will not work, generally.

"The Hub Forums","Xephyr","190.0","2014-01-28T15:32:18","secure bitcoin wallet","General Discussion/Security"," Cold storage beats paper wallets by a country mile. Here is a good guide to setting up cold storage taken from - https://axablends.com/merchants-accepting-bitcoin/bitcoin-wallets/guide-to-bitcoin-cold-storage/    What is bitcoin cold storage and why should I care?  Bitcoin cold storage means keeping your wallet's private keys on an offline computer. There is no more secure way to store your bitcoin, and bitcoin cold storage absolutely protects your bitcoin from loss, theft or seizure.  Online wallets like blockchain.info are convenient but should be considered your bitcoin 'checking account' and used for only a few bitcoin, because online wallets can be hacked (remember Instawallet?) For your bitcoin 'savings account' you need maximum security and that means using a bitcoin client on your home computer, one that supports cold storage.  Which bitcoin wallets offer cold storage?  Only the Armory and Electrum bitcoin wallets allow you to split your wallet into an offline 'cold storage' wallet which contains your private keys and an online 'watching only' wallet that only contains your public keys. Any hacker who is able to access your online wallet cannot steal your bitcoin, which are protected by your private keys in the offline wallet on a separate computer that never connects to the outside world.  The online 'watching only' wallet can give out receiving addresses and generate transactions. When you spend bitcoin from your online wallet the wallet generates an unsigned transaction file that you take to your offline computer on a USB key. You import the unsigned transaction into your offline wallet and sign with your private key, then take the signed transaction back to your online wallet and broadcast the signed transaction. Because your offline wallet never connects to the internet your bitcoins are as secure as possible.  Armory and Electrum are both deterministic wallets and only need to be backed up once. In a deterministic wallet all the bitcoin addresses your wallet will ever generate are derived from a long series of numbers or letters called a seed. As long as you have your seed backed up, you can recreate the wallet at will.  Hardware requirements for bitcoin cold storage:  Armory's online watching only wallet now runs on either 32 bit or 64 bit computer with 1-2 GB RAM.   The computer you use for your offline wallet does not need to be 64 bit. Any computer made in the last ten years should work for your Armory offline wallet. However, for maximum security your offline wallet should be used on a computer with full disk encryption to protect your private keys in case the computer is stolen.  Electrum is a lightweight bitcoin wallet and will run on any computer with no special requirements for memory.  If the operating system on your offline computer does not offer full disk encryption consider replacing the OS with a free Linux distribution which does. See the tutorial at the guide to encrypting your laptop. Using Linux for your offline wallet laptop also protects you from the risk of transmitting Windows malware through the USB drive.  Recommendations:  Make several small transactions with Armory or Electrum until you are comfortable signing transactions with your offline wallet. Even delete your offline wallet and restore from backup to prove to yourself that your wallet can be recovered and your bitcoin are secure.

Posted: May 20, 2015 in Silk Road    Tags: Bitcoin, drugs, Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road, war on drugs     â¦ at his sentencing next week  Ross Ulbricht, convicted of being the Dread Pirate Roberts, owner and operator of the original Silk Road, is due to be sentenced next Friday. And his family would be happy to see you there.  [photo] Ross Ulbricht (far right) and family  âIt would be good to have some support. I think itâs going to be very difficult,â said Rossâ mother, Lyn, who has campaigned tirelessly on his behalf. It is clearly taking its toll on her and the rest of the family and no wonder â even the âbestâ outcome is pretty shitty.  â20 years would be a victory, as horrific as that is for all non-violent charges,â says Lyn. âItâs the least she [Judge Forrest] can give him with the mandatory minimumsâ.  Even though Ulbrichtâs lawyer has provided pretty compelling evidence that Silk Road provided habitual drug users with a far safer experience than their usual manner of getting drugs (the same things I pointed out in a blog in 2012, just sayingâ), the prosecution is pushing for a life sentence. âWe hope sheâll see that 20 years of a young manâs life is sufficient,â says his mother.  Whatever the outcome, his family will be appealing, even if it renders them destitute.  âWe are being financially ruined by this and I lie awake at night wondering where weâll get the money for the appeal,â says Lyn. âSo Iâm hanging in there, but itâs not the easiest phase of my lifeâ.  Ross Ulbrichtâs sentencing hearing details:  Date: May 29  Time: 1 PM  Place: Judge Katherine Forrestâs courtroom, #15A, Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl St., New York, NY.

When someone makes an order with me wallet to wallet I send them a wallet address from an account I make uniquely for this transaction on Agora. The fundamental flaws in this are obvious. If Agora scammed or something happened I would be fucked. It would never effect my customers as even if I lost the money from their purchases I would still ship the product. Every market has an expiration and I have been playing with fire for far too long. I have been using Electrum as a personal wallet for a good amount of time. Only to hold clean coins though. I want to create a unique Electrum wallet in Tails for my wallet to wallet transactions. So I am no longer putting my money in anyones elses hands. Through Tails you can use an untorified browser as well as the tor browser. So I dont see why Electrum through Tails would be torified on its own. I dont see anywhere where it says that Electrum is routed with tor when running it on Tails.  Before anyone says just give people a wallet for a mixer like Helix or Fog, many of my transactions are way too large for their mixers to handle.  Thanks in advance for the help",""

The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind pseudonyms (public keys) which are recommended to be changed frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability. We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the bitcoin network. Our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally verified. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks. Permalink :   http://hdl.handle.net/10993/18679   From a BitCoin help site, we have the following:   Using Bitcoin Anonymously Written by Third Renaissance & Brother Bitcoin Published May 23, 2014 Last updated August 21, 2014  https://bitcoinhelp.net/know/more/using-bitcoin-anonymously (clearnet)  Bitcoin addresses are not themselves linked to a person or entity. That's why Bitcoin is often called pseudonymous or pseudo-anonymous. However, a person's identity can be associated with a Bitcoin address through other means. Once that occurs, it's possible to determine that person's transactions backward and forward through the blockchain history. A single anonymity breach can uncover an individual's entire Bitcoin transaction history.   But how is an address linked with a person? Most commonly, the association occurs when people publish their name together with their Bitcoin address  online. But there are plenty of other ways (take a look at the Top Seven Ways Your Identity Can Be Linked to Your Bitcoin Address)[1]. Once the association has been made, a party with enough determination, time, and resources could analyze the blockchain and determine how many bitcoins an individual has, how they receive them, and how they spend them.    [...]  Avoid Thin Clients and Hosted Wallets  Almost all thin clients leak which addresses you own to whatever Simple Payment Verification (SPV) server they connect to. Thin clients do not store the blockchain locally. Instead, they query a single SPV server for the transactions that involve the addresses in your wallet. While this functionality is far more efficient and fast than parsing the blockchain locally, the trade-off is that every Bitcoin address you own is submitted to the SPV server.  Some thin clients, such as Multibit, have the capability of using bloom filters to help conceal which addresses you own by requesting extra transactions that don't involve your wallet. However, Multibit currently favors efficiency over privacy and does not utilize bloom filters for address anonymization.  The Electrum thin client doesn't use bloom filters at all, so just like Multibit, any server you connect to knows every address that you own.

The developer and/or early adopters of BitCoin stated that you would have to be insane to use it for criminal purposes, as every single transaction that is ever made will be/is recorded in the public blockchain. The only difficulty lies in parsing the blockchain -- right now, this has to be done manually. Within the next several years, I expect that software to perform this task will become available. I would be literally astonished if FinCen wasn't working on it already.    Whether DarkCoin is, in fact, anonymous remains to be seen. There have been some truly anonymous cash schemes proposed in the last 30 years, such as those by David Chaum, but unfortuately for him, he was just too early. I don't know whether any of these schemes are based on Chaum's work or not -- I would suspect that the patents have run out by now.    ""BackCopy"" is someone who has chosen his nym as an homage of sorts to Backopy, who was the developer/adminstrator of Black Market Reloaded (BMR).  If memory serves, BMR shut down around the time that the original Silk Road closed, citing some security issues. Shortly before closing for good, BMR was broken into, and about $200,000 of BTC were stolen, before Backopy shut the server down, to stop the theft.   When he restarted the server, Backopy repaid (out of his own wallet) those whose funds were stolen as part of the hack. He also organized a gradual shutdown of the server, allowing people to conclude their business, and get their coins out, prior to closing for good. That is why Backopy is held in such high regard. No one knows for sure what happened to Backopy; most people think that he is retired on the funds he made through running BMR. If he were to have been arrested, the authorities would, in all likelihood, have made a huge PR blowout of it, they way they did with Silk Road.

Save the un-cleaned file as a png and run exiftool to confirm what it is that it could possibly give away.;Another alternative could be to get the potentially tainted image then create a screenshot of it.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","3280.0","2014-05-15T23:44:02","This should be fun","General Discussion/Security"," FBI plans crackdown on cyber crime, with arrests imminent Published time: May 15, 2014 03:44 Reuters / Samantha Sais  Tags: Court, Crime, FBI, Information Technology, Intelligence, Internet, Law, Security, USA  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will aggressively crack down on cyber crime over the next few weeks, with a bureau official advising the public to anticipate indictments, searches, and multiple arrests.  Robert Anderson Jr. told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit in Washington on Wednesday that the bureau has revamped its focus on cyber crime and will show a âmuch more offensive sideâ to its enforcement efforts soon.  âThere is a philosophy change. If you are going to attack Americans, we are going to hold you accountable,â he said. âIf we can reach out and touch you, we are going to reach out and touch you.â  FBI director James Comey appointed Anderson as the executive assistant director of cyber enforcement at the bureau in March, putting him in charge of international operations and critical incident response, among other duties. Before taking his current post, Anderson oversaw counter intelligence and espionage investigation at the FBI, and seems to have brought that mentality to his current responsibility.  In explaining recent examples of the bureauâs cyber enforcement, Anderson mentioned the case of Dmitry Belorossov, a Russian hacker accused of operating a botnet that targeted an estimated 7,000 Americans. Belorossov was arrested at a Spanish airport and, after an extradition battle between the US and Russia, ordered to stand trial in the US.  Anderson warned that the bureau will not hesitate to charge foreign suspects accused of committing crimes in countries that refuse to extradite to the US. The FBI has traditionally been reluctant to do so, he said, to avoid embarrassment to other nations.  âThereâs a lot of countries that will not extradite,â he told Reuters. âThat will not stop us from pressing forward and charging those individuals and making it public.â  The new, aggressive policy is likely to lead to a slew of new arrests, Anderson continued, adding that Belorossov would be a relatively minor target compared to some of the suspects the FBI is currently investigating.  Other hackers could benefit from bureau leniency if they choose to cooperate. Hector Monsegur â founder of the Lulzsec hacker group perhaps better known as Sabu â has seen his sentencing hearing delayed multiple times in exchange for helping the government infiltrate high-value foreign targets.  Anderson refused to say how many former suspects are now on the FBIâs payroll, but Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told journalists Jim Fenkle and Joseph Menn that the agency relies on more outside help than ever before, with perhaps as many as a dozen hackers.  Along with the tried and true distributed denial of service attacks and attempts at identity theft, experts have warned that cyber crime will become much more serious over the next decade. Future threats could include potential cyber assault on new vehicle models, home appliances, or entertainment devices, as well as more dangerous ransomware attacks that victimize online finances.  Hackers recently targeted Target, obtaining data from as many as 110 million customers. Ed Lowery, a special agent for the criminal investigations unit of the US Secret Service, which also investigates cyber crime, said the public should expect more incidents like this to occur before organizations learn about their vulnerabilities.  âWhat we have seen is a change in the sophistication of attackers and the attack vectors,â he told Eweek.com. âThese are professional criminals; they study their victims, and they are looking for vulnerabilities they can exploit.â   Zaphod ","Ctrl+C Ctrl+V Plz "

","General Discussion/Security","Thread key:  Bold are articles Regular is stuff I typed  At a certain point from March, 2014 to August, 2014 there was a virus known as CryptoLocker it would hijack computers and threaten to encrypt all of the files using RSA 2048 Bit Encryption if you didn't pay 500 USD. The key was stored on a server hidden on the darknet and your files would be decrypted once you've paid. It was spread in the ""Gameover Zeus"" botnet distributed via email until it was shut down by a collaboration of FBI, DOJ and Interpol. There is more about CryptoWare in a optional story you  can read.  Source: http://www.pcworld.com/article/2600543/cryptowall-held-over-halfamillion-computers-hostage-encrypted-5-billion-files.html  -----Begin Optional Story-----If you want to read more about this here is the story:A file-encrypting ransomware program called CryptoWall infected over 600,000 computer systems in the past six months and held 5 billion files hostage, earning its creators more than $1 million, researchers found.The Counter Threat Unit (CTU) at Dell SecureWorks performed an extensive analysis of CryptoWall that involved gathering data from its command-and-control (C&C) servers, tracking its variants and distribution methods and counting payments made by victims so far.CryptoWall is âthe largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internetâ at the moment and will likely continue to grow, the CTU researchers said Wednesday in a blog post that details their findings.The threat has been spreading since at least November 2013, but until the first quarter of this year it remained mostly overshadowed by CryptoLocker, another ransomware program that infected over half a million systems from September 2013 through May.CryptoLocker asked victims for ransoms between $100 and $500 to recover their encrypted files and is estimated to have earned its creators around $3 million over 9 months of operation. The threat was shut down at the end of May following a multi-national law enforcement operation that had support from security vendors.CryptoWall filled the void left by CryproLocker on the ransomware landscape through aggressive distribution using a variety of tactics that included spam emails with malicious links or attachments, drive-by-download attacks from sites infected with exploit kits and through installations by other malware programs already running on compromised computers.cryptowall mimicking cryptolocker DELL SECUREWORKSEarly versions of CryptoWall (left) copied Cryptolocker (right) in both execution and design, Dell Secureworks reports.The CryptoWall command-and-control servers assign a unique identifier to every infection and generate RSA public-private key pairs for each one.The public keys are sent to infected computers and are used by the malware to encrypt files with popular extensionsâmovies, images, documents, etc.âthat are stored on local hard drives, as well as on mapped network shares, including those from cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive.Files encrypted with an RSA public key can only be decrypted with its corresponding private key, which remains in the possession of the attackers and is only released after the ransom has been paid.The CTU researchers were able to count the unique computer identifiers from the CryptoWall servers and also obtained information about their IP (Internet Protocol) address, approximate time of infection, and payment status.âBetween mid-March and August 24, 2014, nearly 625,000 systems were infected with CryptoWall,â the CTU researchers said. âIn that same timeframe, CryptoWall encrypted more than 5.25 billion files.âThe largest number of infected systems were located in the United Statesâ253,521 or 40.6 percent of the total. The next most affected countries were Vietnam with 66,590 infections, the U.K. with 40,258, Canada with 32,579 and India with 22,582.CryptoWall typically asks victims to pay the ransom in Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but earlier variants offered more payment options, including pre-paid cards like MoneyPak, Paysafecard, cashU, and Ukash.The ransom amount grows if a victim doesnât pay the ransom within the initial allotted time, which is usually between four and seven days. The CTU researchers observed payments that ranged between $200 and $10,000 in value, the majority of them (64 percent) being of $500.âOf nearly 625,000 infections, 1,683 victims (0.27%) paid the ransom, for a total take of $1,101,900 over the course of six months,â the CTU researchers said.This suggests that while CryptoWall managed to infect 100,000 more computers than CryptoLocker, it was less effective at generating income for its creators. Researchers determined in the past that 1.3 percent of CryptoLocker victims paid the ransom for a total of over 3 million dollars.The difference in success rate might be explained through the technical barriers involved in obtaining Bitcoins, the CTU researchers said. In the case of CryptoLocker, 1.1 percent of victims paid the ransom through MoneyPak and only 0.21 percent used Bitcoin.The CTU analysis found similarities between CryptoWare samples and those of an older ransomware family called Tobfy. If the same attackers are behind both threats, it means that they have at least several years of experience in ransomware operations.-----End Story----- Anyway, in April my other computer got infected with a virus, not known as CryptoLocker which was shut down, but CryptoLocker 3.0.   Here is an interesting article discussing the difference between CryptoLocker and CryptoLocker 2.0 which is not the virus I have been infected with but another different virus.  Sources:  http://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/12/19/cryptolocker-2-0-new-version-or-copycat/  -----Beging Optional Article-----In our previous blog, Filecoder: Holding your data to ransom, we published information about the resurgence of file-encrypting ransomware since July 2013. While the majority of these ransomware families are most widespread in Russia, there are families that are targeting users (especially business users) globally.Cryptolocker, detected by ESET as Win32/Filecoder.BQ, is one of the most infamous examples and has received widespread public and media attention in the past two months. As shown by the ESET LiveGridÂ® detection statistics below, the country most affected by this family is the United States.1Last month we discovered another Filecoder family, which caught our attention because it called itself âCryptolocker 2.0â. Naturally, we wondered if this is a newer version of the widespread ransomware developed by the same gang. In this blog post, we will provide a comparison between this âCryptolocker 2.0â â detected by ESET products as MSIL/Filecoder.D and MSIL/Filecoder.E â and the âregularâ Cryptolocker.Cryptolocker 2.0 vs. CryptolockerBoth malware families operate in a similar manner. After infection, they scan the victimâs folder structure for files matching a set of file extensions, encrypt them and display a message window that demands a ransom in order to decrypt the files. Both use RSA public-key cryptography. But there are some implementation differences between the two families.2newsideThere are three visible differences between the two families. Cryptolocker uses (as mentioned in the ransom message) RSA-2048, whereas Cryptolocker 2.0 claims to use RSA-4096 (though in reality it uses RSA-1024). Cryptolocker 2.0 displays the deadline by which the private key will supposedly be deleted, but doesnât show a countdown timer like Cryptolocker. And, interestingly, Cryptolocker 2.0 only accepts the ransom in Bitcoins, whereas different variants of Cryptolocker have also been accepting MoneyPak, Ukash or cashU vouchers.More implementation differences were revealed after analyzing the malware. The first and most obvious difference is in the programming language used â Cryptolocker was compiled using Visual C++, whereas Cryptolocker 2.0 was written in C#. The files and Registry keys used by the malware are different, and, more interestingly, so is the list of file extensions that the ransomware seeks to encrypt. Cryptolocker appears to be more âbusiness-user-orientedâ and doesnât encrypt image, video and music files, whereas Cryptolocker 2.0 does â its list of targets includes file extensions such as .mp3, .mp4, .jpg, .png, .avi, .mpg, and so on.When the malware is run, it contacts the C&C server to request a unique RSA public key. Then, each file that meets specific criteria (matching file extension, file path not in exclusion list) is encrypted using a different randomly-generated 3DES key, and this key is then encrypted using the RSA public key received from the server. The encrypted key is then written to an auxiliary file, with the same filename and extension as the encrypted file and an appended second extension â.kâ:%filename%.%fileext%.kThus, decryption of the files would only be feasible if the RSA private key was known, which would allow the decryption of the 3DES keys.The original Cryptolocker works in a similar fashion, with some subtle differences. For example, it uses AES instead of 3DES. Also, the encrypted key is saved to the end of each encrypted file, not in a separate file.Cryptolocker (Win32/Filecoder.BQ) also contains a domain-generation-algorithm for C&C addresses, whereas the new Cryptolocker 2.0 doesnât contain such a feature. An overview of the differences between the two malware families is presented in the table below.c2tableIn addition to this, the recently-discovered trojan contains some features unrelated to the ransomware functionality. The application includes windows that mimic âactivatorsâ or cracks for proprietary software, including Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Team Viewer, Adobe Photoshop or even ESET Smart Security.56The application chooses which window to display depending on the binaryâs file name. After launch, it is installed on the system, and subsequently the malware operates in the âransomware modeâ as described above. This technique of masquerading as software cracks serves as an additional spreading mechanism for the trojan. Aside from the legal issues, this demonstrates the increased risks entailed when using pirated software.Cryptolocker 2.0 is also capable of spreading via removable media by replacing the content of .exe files they contain with its own body.The list of functionalities present in the trojan code is quite extensive and also includes stealing Bitcoin wallet files, launching the legitimate BFGMiner application or running DDoS attacks against a specified server. However, we were unable to establish whether this functionality was actually being used at present.ConclusionTaking into account all the aforementioned differences, it is unlikely that the malware that calls itself âCryptolocker 2.0â is actually a new version of the previous Cryptolocker ransomware from the same authors. The switch from C++ to C# would be something unexpected to say the least, and in any case none of the key differences can be considered significant âimprovementsâ.More probably, someone used Cryptolocker as an inspiration for garnering some illicit earnings. After all, this is not the first copy-cat.Nevertheless, the ransomware detected as MSIL/Filecoder.D or MSIL/Filecoder.E can still be a cause of distress to the victim, if they donât have backups of their files. For this reason, the importance of a proper backup routine can never be emphasised enough.Additionally, we recommend that our users update to version 7 of our security products (ESET Smart Security and ESET NOD32 Antivirus) so as to make use of the Advanced Memory Scanner feature, which has been proven to improve detection of new incarnations of malware variants, including ransomware.Author Robert Lipovsky, ESET-----End Optional Article-----  So to answer the question is sort of. There are subtle differences between the two. CryptoLocker and CrytoLocker 2.0 are not that distinct, but they are not copycats for sure.   Here is some information about CryptoLocker 3.0 I've copied and pasted another article so you get lots more information.  Sources:  -----Begin Another Article-----This post was authored by Andrea Allievi  & Earl CarterRansomware continues to impact a large number of organizations and the malware continues to evolve. In January, we examined Cryptowall 2.0 and highlighted new features incorporated into the dropper and Cryptowall binary. When Cryptowall 3.0 appeared, we were interested in seeing what new functionality was incorporated into this latest variant in the Cryptowall series.The latest 3.0 sample that we analyzed was in a zip file. This zip file contains multiple dropper files which are essentially identical in functionality except for the encryption algorithm used to obfuscate the dropper and eventually build the Cryptowall 3.0 binary.Similar to the 2.0 version, the dropper is encrypted with a custom algorithm three times, but that is where the similarities end. In the 3.0 sample that we analyzed, the following dropper features (which we identified as being operational in version 2.0) have been removed:Switching between 32 and 64 bit operationEmploying multiple exploits in the dropperAnti-VM check to prevent running in virtual environmentExamining the dropper in the 3.0 sample indicates that it includes a lot of useless API calls and dead code. Apparently the dropper for this version of Cryptowall has been streamlined. The lack of any exploits in the dropper seems to indicate that the malware authors are focusing more on using exploit kits as an attack vector, since the exploit kitâs functionality could be used to gain privilege escalation on the system. Without privilege escalation, attempting to turn off many enabled security features on the system is likely to fail.Constructing the Unencrypted Cryptowall BinaryDuring the first decryption stage, the dropper reads its encrypted code, decrypts and stores it at RVA 0x1B9E0A0 (in the data section). The second stage decryption code begins by locating the byte pattern  (0x35, 0x5e, 0x74) inside its â.dataâ section. Once this location is identified, it starts decrypting the data following that marker directly onto the stack. Finally, the third stage begins by transferring execution to the unencrypted code that was placed on the stack. During this third stage, the code builds the small IAT (more or less 30 APIs) that is needed to extract and decrypt the BASE64-encoded resource (ID 62) placed inside the âMessage Tablesâ group. The resource is decoded and then decrypted. The decrypted resource is a file that contains the last encryption stage code.The last stage builds another IAT, cycles between all running processes trying to find out if its own process name is âperl.exeâ or âpython.exeâ. If the check indicates that the parent process name is âperl.exeâ or âpython.exeâ, then the program runs the following endless loop and never runs the Cryptowall 3.0 code.Cryptowall-loopIf the parent process is not âperl.exeâ of âpython.exeâ, the encrypted code inside the resource (that is actual a PE file) is decrypted into an external buffer; a process is created in a suspended state (backed by the original packed executable) and the same trick used in the CryptoWall 2.0 is employed to inject the clean PE inside the suspended process (ZwUnmapViewOfSection / VirtualAllocEx / WriteProcessMemory). Finally the execution control is released to the clean CryptoWall 3.0 Code.Cryptowall 3.0 AnalysisThe CryptoWall 3.0 initialization code is the same as the previous version of the infection: a big IAT is built and the code is injected in a new spawned âexplorer.exeâ. The code located in the âexplorer.exeâ process installs Cryptowall 3.0 in the target system in exactly the same manner as the previous version (âRunâ / âRunOnceâ registry keys and âStartupâ start menu folder). Finally all the system protections (and all System volume shadow images) are disabled and the code is injected in a new spawned âsvchost.exeâ process.Main SVCHOST CodeThe code injected inside the âSvchost.exeâ process implements the main malware functionality. It starts building the large IAT and creating the main event. Cryptowall 3.0 acquires a lot of system information (like the computer name, main processor speed and type, and so onâ¦) and generates a global MD5 used as Victim ID. One of the new feature of CryptoWall 3.0 is the usage of I2P network. The dropper generates its I2P network proxy and Url lists. In the dropper we have analysed, we found the following I2P CryptoWall Urls:proxy1-1-1.i2pproxy2-2-2.i2pproxy3-3-3.i2pproxy4-4-4.i2pproxy5-5-5.i2pCryptowall registers the victim workstation to its Command & Control server: a request string is generated in the following format:{<Request ID>|crypt1|<Victim PC MD5>|<OS Ver Index>..||External Ip Address}To obtain the external Ip Address, Cryptowall 3.0 uses the same algorithm seen in its previous version. This string is encoded for the I2P network, and it is sent through an I2P Proxy. The included I2P proxy list contains the following addresses:91.121.12.127:41415.199.165.160:808094.247.28.26:2525194.58.109.158:2525195.29.106.157:444494.247.31.19:8080194.58.109.137:343594.247.28.156:8081209.148.85.151:8080Here is an example of Cryptowall Command & Control server registration string with a request ID of 1:{1|crypt1|9831374BF569D58A8BED493DF407F4EF|5|1|2||5.170.247.119}The CryptoWall 3.0 dropper tests each Proxy address, searching for the live ones. The connection will be established to the target I2P Url through the chosen proxy. A POST request is made, containing the encoded request string. The Command & Control server answers with a 3 digit ID. The ID is verified, and if all has gone fine, the dropper spawns the Main CryptoWall Thread.HELP_DECRYPTTHE MAIN CRYPTOWALL THREADThe main CryptoWall thread initializes the Windows Crypto functions and creates the main registry key: âHKCU\<Victim Pc MD5>â. It tries to acquire the Public key for the later files encryption, using another well-formed Command & Control Message (ID 7):{7|crypt1|<Victim PC MD5>|1}The Received public key is verified and imported in the Windows Cryptographic Provider using the âCryptImportPublicKeyInfoâ API. The text version of the public key is stored in the registry, by a registry value name generated by a Cryptowall routine, using index 2 (the actual value name is calculated starting from the Victim PC MD5). The hash of the public key is used by the bad guys to generate the âUser personal codeâ.The hash of the public key is also calculated and used to retrieve the CryptoWall PNG wallpaper, and to compile the âDecrypt Instructionâ files. These instructions are based on the geolocation of the hosts IP address. This means that the instructions should hopefully appear in the native language of the user of the computer.When the PNG Wallpaper has been correctly downloaded, it is stored in the registry value with index 5. Even the decrypt instructions files are generated and saved on disk.Finally the code cycles between all the mounted volumes (obtained using âGetLogicalDriveStringsâ API), and spawn one CryptoWall Encryption thread for each volume that is not an optical drive.IOCsCryptowall 3.0.zip hash â(sha256: 838e19ff3f52952c292f945054520eb5707c80a389b1f88770b1ccc09f966c65).Dropper 1 hash â(sha256: 9e06d2ce0741e039311261acc3d3acbaba12e02af8a8f163be926ca90230fa89)Dropper 2 hash â(sha256: 55e866cc8580e5f9f7f6560e478f3b37b3362e9f94e88439beef6026c86c80be)Dropper 3 hash â(sha256: 45317968759d3e37282ceb75149f627d648534c5b4685f6da3966d8f6fca662d)I2P Proxy Addresses:91.121.12.127:41415.199.165.160:808094.247.28.26:2525194.58.109.158:2525195.29.106.157:444494.247.31.19:8080194.58.109.137:343594.247.28.156:8081209.148.85.151:8080CONCLUSIONThe dropper we analyzed is much more streamlined in functionality. Many of the dropper features deployed in Cryptowall 2.0 are no longer present in the 3.0 sample. New functionality has also been added, such as incorporating I2P network communication. Ransomware variants continue to try to improve the stealth of their network communications using networks such as TOR and I2P.Identifying and stopping ransomware variants definitely requires a layered security approach. Breaking any step in the attack chain will successfully prevent this attack. Therefore, blocking the initial phishing emails, blocking network connections to known malicious content, as well as stopping malicious process activity are critical to combating ransomware and preventing it from holding your data hostage.Establishing a solid backup and restore policy is also crucial to overcoming attacks to your data, whether they occur from natural disasters, such as a storm, or whether they occur from a malicious attack across the network.  Many companies believed they had a solid backup plan only to find the malware encrypted the backup to prevent them from restoring any data. It is imperative to adhere to industry wide best practices which include making sure that you backup copies are safe from both physical destruction, as well as corruption from viruses and other malicious software.Protecting Users from These Threatsgroup_72_detection  Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites used in these types of attacks.The Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect malicious network activity by threat actors.ESA can block spear phishing emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.-----End Article-----    Given that I got this infection, and recovered from it. In April, I got the virus which means it is still being distributing through email and other malware. My computer did contain a pesky ad I got rid of named ""AdvancedElite"" and ""Atuzi"". So watch out for those, any webistes where you see ""Powered by AdvancedElite"" run. It will install itself onto your computer, it can be uninstalled, but it is the reason for pesky little malware like CryptoLocker 3.0.   With I quick DuckDuckGo search I was able to find that there are other reported cases of ""AdvancedElite"" infected the computer with ransomware namely CryptoLocker. ""Atuzi"" is also responsible for distributing CryptoLocker.    Any time you see ""Powered by AdvancedElite"" on a page, run! It will crawl into your computer and install malware and ransomware like CryptoLocker 3.0.  Stay frosty!  -Hansmann      ",""

The most significant is the statement: ""Anti-VM check to prevent running in virtual environment"".  Most malware doesn't want to run in a VM. So...use a VM.  Also, CryptoLocker 3 is completely different than the original CryptoLocker. In truth, the 3.0 version shouldn't be called CryptLocker at all. It is a completely different family of malware. The original Crypto is impossible to remove. You can remove 3.0 with almost any anti-virus.  The creator of the original Crypto never made the code available to anyone else, thus it is more rare.

I'm making earnings on the deep web, by selling this and that.   I'm not making a great fortune (not riding with red porsches and stuff), but an amount of money that covers my real life expenses well. I usually take out the money on Bitstamp, without problems.  Today, when I tried to do something on it, they faced me a few KYC questions, about what are the origins of the deposited bitcoins, do I plan to withdraw money in the future... this kind of stuff. I googled the problem, and  - fortunately - I'm not the only one... they do this to a lot of their customers. Seems like to me that they doing this to those who's traffic is on a higher volume and frequency.  Now, what are you suggesting for me? I would like to use the exchange in the future as well, but I don't know how much I need to fear. Can you give me advice about this situation? Also, if it's not a secret, what methods are you using for withdrawing the not-so-clean bitcoins safely? (After tumbling, of course.)  Thank you.  P.  PS: Localbitcoins does not work with me.",""

They have a free option and do not need to install additional softwares. I was reading a a very bad review against  itshidden.eu here : http://bestvpnreviews.com/best-free-vpn-reviews/itshidden-free-vpn-review. I wonder if FrootVPN advertised by Thepiratebay is as bad as itshidden.eu.  REVIEW :     ITS HIDDEN is a free VPN service that, like other free services, trades your personal information for affiliate and advertising revenues to pay for the service. The result â You have less privacy and security and your personal information is at more risk than if you were not to use this service.      There is no software; you must use your own OS for the VPN connection which means there are no features whatsoever. The server network is small and practically unusable at any hour as the network is constantly busy. The privacy policy is designed to give your personal information away to third parties. If you want a secure VPN, this is not for you.      ItsHidden Free VPN PROS:     â¢ Free      ItsHidden Free VPN CONS:      â¢ No privacy or security     â¢ IPs Blacklisted for SPAMMING     â¢ Usually unable to connect to server, very high latency, generally unusable     â¢ The serversâ data bases are vulnerable to attacks which means your personal data is open for any hacker to steal     â¢ Complicated and inconvenient installation for most users     â¢ No software application just your own OS     â¢ NO features and user un-friendly     â¢ No automation on start up     â¢ No automatic choice of fastest server (lowest latency)     â¢ Adverse privacy policy set up to benefit Its Hidden and harm the user by giving away your IP, browsing history and personal information to third parties.     â¢ Logs and stores personal information for third parties and advertisers     â¢ No support or help",""

WTF?PGP/GPG are very fussy when it comes to key formatting. In particular, you have to watch out for the following: 1) Ensure that there are exactly 5 dashes in the -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- lines. If even one dash is missing, you will get a No Keys Found to Import error message. 2) The Forum software, for some unknown reason, prepends (or indents) 4 spaces before the start of each line in the PGP key. You have to remove that indentation with a text editor prior to importing the key. If you do the above, you should be able to import keys without any problem, assuming that the key isn't otherwise mangled or malformed in the first place. If you try the above, and it still doesn't work, PM me the key, and I'll take a look at it. Sometimes it's possible to fix mangled keys so they can be imported. Zaphod"

"The Hub Forums","Jack Harkness","7679.0","2015-03-29T02:48:07","This DDoS was predicted in 2014!","General Discussion/Security","","The anonymous Tor network will suffer a major DDoS attack in 2015, most likely by a nation state, bringing the platform to its knees, according to messaging security firm Cloudmark.The vendor made the predictions in a new blog post [http://blog.cloudmark.com/2014/12/02/predictions-for-2015/] looking ahead to the major security trends of the next 12 months.  It argued that because Tor has a limited number of endpoints â connected to the rest of the internet and publicly listed Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­â launching such an attack would be within the capabilities of any serious attacker.Andrew Conway, research analyst at Cloudmark, told Infosecurity that an âagency of a nation stateâ is most likely to publicly launch such an attack next year either because of the illegal activities Tor helps protect, such as sites like Silk Road, or because it feels âpolitically threatened by the content.ââWe may never really know who is directly responsible as it will likely be a secret or false flag operation. For example, an oppressive nation state would have reasons to do this to prevent dissidents from using it but blame it on US law enforcement,â he argued.âOn the other hand, if a drug sale site like Silk Road is set up with the servers and principals in a country outside the reach of US law enforcement, I could see law enforcement doing it to make it easier to track down the users of the website by monitoring traffic to that IP address.âOther Cloudmark predictions for 2015 include more attacks on payment systems and the building out of elite cyber-espionage teams by more nation states.It added that government takedowns of drugs marketplaces like Silk Road and Silk Road 2 will continue, but as long as Tor is up new ones will arrive to take their place.The recent capture of alleged Silk Road 2 mastermind [http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/feds-catch-silk-road-2-mastermind/] Blake Benthall came not as a result of the Feds somehow deanonymizing the Tor network, but thanks to an undercover Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent who successfully infiltrated the siteâs support staff."

"The Hub Forums","Guyver","5701.0","2014-11-24T21:13:25","Magic Mushrooms Create a Hyperconnected Brain","General Discussion/Legal","Magic mushrooms may give users trippy experiences by creating a hyperconnected brain.  The active ingredient in the psychedelic drug, psilocybin, seems to completely disrupt the normal communication networks in the brain, by connecting ""brain regions that don't normally talk together,"" said study co-author Paul Expert, a physicist at King's College London.  The research, which was published today (Oct. 28) in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, is part of a larger effort to understand how psychedelic drugs work, in the hopes that they could one day be used by psychiatrists Ã¢â¬â in carefully controlled settings Ã¢â¬â to treat conditions such as depression, Expert said.     Magic mushrooms  Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, is best known for triggering vivid hallucinations. It can make colors seem oversaturated and dissolve the boundaries between objects.  But the drug also seems to have more long-lasting effects. Many people report intensely spiritual experiences while taking the drug, and some studies even suggest that one transcendent trip can alter people's personalities on a long-term basis, making those individuals more open to new experiences and more appreciative of art, curiosity and emotion.  People who experiment with psilocybin ""report it as one of the most profound experiences they've had in their lives, even comparing it to the birth of their children,"" Expert told Live Science.  Making connections  Scientists have long known that psilocybin binds to a receptor in the brain for serotonin, a brain chemical that plays a role in mood, appetite and sleep, but exactly how the drug transforms the whole brain's pattern of communication isn't clear.  In past work, Expert's colleagues had found that psilocybin spurred the brain into a more dreamlike state, and that the drug decreased brain activity.  In the current study, the team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brain activity of 15 healthy volunteers Ã¢â¬â once after they had taken a placebo, and once after they took the hallucinogen psilocybin. (The team chose only people who had reported past positive experiences with magic mushrooms to prevent them from panicking inside the claustrophobic MRI machines.)  The team then compared the brain activity of the individuals on and off the drug, and created a map of connections between different brain regions.  Psilocybin dramatically transformed the participants' brain organization, Expert said. With the drug, normally unconnected brain regions showed brain activity that was synchronized tightly in time. That suggested the drug was stimulating long-range connections the brain normally wouldn't make. After the drug wore off, brain activity went back to normal.  Drug's effect  Psilocybin may create a brain state akin to synesthesia, a sensory effect in which one sense stimulus (such as a number) always gets paired in the brain with another (such as a color or a sound), the researchers wrote in the paper. People with synesthesia may see certain colors when they hear music, or always see the number 3 in yellow, for instance, Expert said.  The findings could help scientists who are studying the drug as a potential treatment for depression, Expert said. Past work has found that people tend to be happier even after using psilocybin just once, but scientists would need to get a much better picture of how the drug impacts the brain before using psilocybin to treat depression, Expert said.  The research could ultimately also help answer bigger questions of the mind, like how people construct a sense of self.  ""Through studies such as these we can really begin to tackle the questions of how we achieve coherent experiences of ourselves in the world around us, and understand what makes this break down,"" said Mitul Mehta, a psychopharmacology researcher at King's College London, who was not involved in the study.

The code grew organically over the last 10 years, and is likely unmaintainable. Furthermore, the older the unmaintained code gets, the more chance there is for vulnerabilities of one sort or another to be found.  It' s a bit like people who still insist on using PGP 2.3a, because they were convinced Phil Zimmermann 'put a backdoor' in later versions of PGP.  While superb for its time, that code is now showing its age: it relies on the IDEA cipher, and most ominously, the MD5 hash algorithm, which has been broken for quite some time.   Zaphod ","I do not know what happened or the reasons why it happened. TC has been closed and a fork has begun. I do not trust forks. If it ain't broke don't fix it, I say. All I do know is that I have a backup copy of TC and will use it with a strong password until I die. Fuck off Microsoft! Fuck off LE!"

Over the long haul, the odds favor the house (Feds), which is why the ideal situation is to get in, make your money, and get out. Given that the odds are in the house's favor, the longer you play, the greater is the chance that you will lose. So, the longer a market remains in operation, the better are the odds that it will be busted.

So while none of these services are perfect, they will all do the job of obfuscating your btc trail a lot better than using LBC alone.  But to be honest, you should never 'trust' any service completely.  Put your coins in, and get them out as soon as possible.  Never trust someone else to keep your coins safe, that is solely your responsibility and solely your loss should something nefarious occur.","Quote from: Positive-Jing on December 06, 2014, 06:03:24 amIf you don't like or trust tumblers you have lots of options in obfuscating the btc connection. One way would be to create anonymous accounts on localbitcoins.com and sell to yourself. Not only would that alone break the connection but lbtc uses its own wallet which also acts like a tumbler. You could also consider doing the same thing on an exchange like btc-e.I want to make sure I'm clear on this.So I can go buy BTC off of name-your-major-btc-wallet with my bank info,then sell those coins from an anon acct on lbtc to another anon acct on lbtc,and voila, my btc are all clean of traces of me?Is it really that easy?"

If you really want to get into the act, send messages back and forth with yourself in case there is any sort of investigation.   This can all be done very quickly and does not rely on any mysterious tumbler site that may or may not be run by LE.  If anyone has any critiques I encourage you to post.

One way would be to create anonymous accounts on localbitcoins.com and sell to yourself. Not only would that alone break the connection but lbtc uses its own wallet which also acts like a tumbler. You could also consider doing the same thing on an exchange like btc-e.I want to make sure I'm clear on this.So I can go buy BTC off of name-your-major-btc-wallet with my bank info,then sell those coins from an anon acct on lbtc to another anon acct on lbtc,and voila, my btc are all clean of traces of me?Is it really that easy?No.  While the above approach could be used in a pinch, I would always recommend an actual mixing service be used.  Bitblender is reliable and fast (though they got hacked not all that long ago), BTC Fog has been around a long time and has always worked well for me (but all the happenings at Agora make me nervous as I've always seen the two services as linked), Grams Helix has also always worked well for me and its light version does not require an account to be created (but again, they've had some security issues of late).So while none of these services are perfect, they will all do the job of obfuscating your btc trail a lot better than using LBC alone.But to be honest, you should never 'trust' any service completely.  Put your coins in, and get them out as soon as possible.  Never trust someone else to keep your coins safe, that is solely your responsibility and solely your loss should something nefarious occur."

There is another recent issue that I have not seen reported on the DNMs.  There are multiple Directory Authority errors occuring, including missing signatures, lack of bandwidth reporting, and timeouts (https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2014-December/005386.html).  This may be related to the possible Sybil attack. There are some comments about it on the tor-talk mailing list (http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.network.tor.user/30553), however, it seems that much attention is not being given due to the LizardSquad attack, with developers saying the network can make do without an authority or two while the possible Sybil attack is dealt with.  tl;dr:  Massive attempted Sybil (deanonymizing) attack on Tor, as well as several DA errors.  Recommended mitigation is to strictly exclude US relays in torrc until the devs have sorted out the situation.",""

According to lead researcher Professor Pauwelse, âTribler makes BitTorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.âThe researchers from Delft University of Technology find their way to resolve this problem. With Tribler, the researchers have developed strong BitTorrent Client, which do not depend on the central services. As an alternative, it is designed for keeping BitTorrent alive even if all the torrent search engines, trackers and indexes are being dragged offline.To make the story short, the latest version of Tribler released today is also offering anonymity to the users by this custom-built Tor network. This permits users to publish and share files without distributing their IP address.Professor Pouwelse said, âThe public was beginning to lose battle for internet freedom, but today we are proud to be able to present an attack-resilient and censorship-resilient infrastructure to the rest of the world.This latest BitTorrent is now released with End-to-End encryption, right after its thorough tests of anonymity feature early this year. Tribler has executed a Tor onion-like routing network that can hide who ever seed or share files. The users may change the âhopsâ number they use to increase the anonymity.According to Professor Pouwelse, âTribler creates a new dedicated network for anonymity that is no way connected to the main Tor Network. By Using Tribler, you became part of a Tor-like network and help others become anonymous.â âThat means you no longer have any exposure in any swarm, either downloading or seeding,â he added.The disadvantage of this increasing privacy is the using of a higher bandwidth. This is because users themselves are becoming proxies and they also have to relay the other usersâ transfers. To add more, this anonymity feature can also slowdown the transfer speeds depending to the other usersâ willingness to share."

","This might be of some interest to you:QuoteResearchers Make BitTorrent Network Anonymous, Decentralized and Impossible to ShutdownAs BitTorrent ecosystem is full of doubts and uncertainty, researchers from Delft University of Technology created the very first version of anonymous and decentralized BitTorrent Network. According to lead researcher Professor Pauwelse, âTribler makes BitTorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.âThe researchers from Delft University of Technology find their way to resolve this problem. With Tribler, the researchers have developed strong BitTorrent Client, which do not depend on the central services. As an alternative, it is designed for keeping BitTorrent alive even if all the torrent search engines, trackers and indexes are being dragged offline.To make the story short, the latest version of Tribler released today is also offering anonymity to the users by this custom-built Tor network. This permits users to publish and share files without distributing their IP address.Professor Pouwelse said, âThe public was beginning to lose battle for internet freedom, but today we are proud to be able to present an attack-resilient and censorship-resilient infrastructure to the rest of the world.This latest BitTorrent is now released with End-to-End encryption, right after its thorough tests of anonymity feature early this year. Tribler has executed a Tor onion-like routing network that can hide who ever seed or share files. The users may change the âhopsâ number they use to increase the anonymity.According to Professor Pouwelse, âTribler creates a new dedicated network for anonymity that is no way connected to the main Tor Network. By Using Tribler, you became part of a Tor-like network and help others become anonymous.â âThat means you no longer have any exposure in any swarm, either downloading or seeding,â he added.The disadvantage of this increasing privacy is the using of a higher bandwidth. This is because users themselves are becoming proxies and they also have to relay the other usersâ transfers. To add more, this anonymity feature can also slowdown the transfer speeds depending to the other usersâ willingness to share.full article here: http://www.digitalmunition.me/?p=3383 !clearnet!"

Since protocol design is a research interest of mine, I did some casual analysis based off the documentation and publicly available source code.  Disclaimer: Analysis was casual and not massively in-depth though I believe it to be correct.  Known issues are highlighted as such, though there is a decent amount of new material.  References to how Tor approaches certain design problems are provided as appropriate.  TLDR: Do not use this if your threat model includes active attackers, adversaries versed in cryptography, those with lots of money, or if you wish to be anonymous.  Material covered:   * The protocol documentation located at    https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications   * The source code of the ""devel"" branch    https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/tree/devel/Tribler    as of commit a98db38f60550dd304d1e329e16a41a683666c15  Protocol flaws:   * There is no built in safeguard against creating circuits of    arbitrary lengths.  The subset of the Tor protocol the Tribler    designers implemented is lacking a RELAY_EARLY type construct.     Active adversaries can exploit this flaw to create substantial load    on the Tribler network, and mount certain kinds of attacks.     See:     * Proposal 110 "" Avoiding infinite length circuits""       (https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/110-avoid-infinite-circuits.txt)     * Evans, S., Dingledine, R., Grothoff, C. ""A Practical Congestion       Attack on Tor Using Long Paths""       (http://grothoff.org/christian/tor.pdf)   * The symmetric encryption is ECB-AES128, without authentication.     The former is a documented flaw in the specification and is claimed    that it is ""for testing"", with what looks like a skeletal attempt    to use OFB-AES128 present in the code.     ECB should not go on the wire ever and is only useful as a building    block for other modes.  Even as a ""for testing"" this is rather    sloppy, and is something that should have been addressed way before    real users start using the protocol.     The skeletal OFB-AES128 implementation included in dead code is not    any better as it reuses a hard coded initialization vector for every    single encryption operation.  IV reuse within a given key across    encryption operations breaks the confidentiality of the mode.     The lack of authentication is flat out inexcusable for reasons that    should be obvious.     It is worth noting that this is one of the kludgier bits of the Tor    wire protocol currently (see the 'digest' and 'recognized' fields in    each RELAY cell, and proposals/ideas/xxx-new-crypto-sketch.txt), so    improvements over ""what Tor does"" are possible and recommended.  Implementation flaws:    (As an aside, it's somewhat difficult to sort through which parts of   the cryptography code are actually used and which are not.)   * When gmpy is not present, Diffie-Hellman keys are generated with    python's random.randint().  This is issue #874, and it should be    evident why this is incorrect, and utterly terrible.     The fact that developer comments regarding this bug note that this    fallback is present only because gmpy did not work on Android    should raise massive red flags in light of the next issue.    * When gmpy *is* installed, Diffie-Hellman keys are generated with    gmpy's ""rand()"".      while dh_secret >= DIFFIE_HELLMAN_MODULUS or dh_secret < 2:       dh_secret = rand(""next"", DIFFIE_HELLMAN_MODULUS)     As far as I can tell, gmpy's rand() is either unseeded or is seeded    via the following idiom that is scattered throughout the code (I    suspect it is the latter, due to the Paillier cryptosystem code    being cross referenced from other modules, but it's hard to tell):      # The definition of StrongRandom changes depending on the file.     # But every file that uses the construct illustrated here pulls it     # in from optional_crypto, which looks like:     #   try:     #     raise ImportError()     #     # Dead code, this would be slightly less horrific, maybe.     #     from Crypto.Random.random import StrongRandom     #   except ImportError:     #     # ... Words can not describe how sad I am.     #     from random import Random as StrongRandom     from optional_crypto import StrongRandom     from sys import maxint          rand('init', 128)     rand('seed', StrongRandom().randint(0, maxint))     The unseeded case results in a LCG of the form:       x = 1 // Yes, a hard coded seed.      x = (29CF535 * x + 1) % (2^32)       It should be obvious as to why this is totally broken.     The seeded case results in a LCG of the form:       x = (48A74F367FA7B5C8ACBB36901308FA85 * x + 1) % (2^128)       This is fatally broken and insecure on several fronts.        a) ""StrongRandom"" is Mersenne Twister seeded once via          os.urandom().  What little ""StrongRandom"" actually resembles          something that is ""Strong"" and ""Random"" is due to the Python          developers, though in practice it is neither.        b) The GMP LCG is seeded with 32/64 bits of ""entropy"", where          ""entropy"" is Mersenne Twister output.        c) GMP's LCG is used for key generation.   * How not to do Diffie-Hellman:     key = pow(dh_received, dh_secret, DIFFIE_HELLMAN_MODULUS)     This is relatively minor since recovering the secret key is trivial    via PRNG attacks, so the fact that the modular exponentiation is not    constant time matters less.   * How not to do RSA:     def rsa_encrypt(key, element):      assert isinstance(element, (long, int)), type(element)      _element = mpz(element)      return long(pow(_element, key.e, key.n))     def rsa_decrypt(key, cipher):      assert isinstance(cipher, long), type(cipher)      _cipher = mpz(cipher)      return long(pow(_cipher, key.d, key.n))     RSA being implemented without blinding, using GMP's modular    exponentiation, and without OAEP is something I pray that I never    see again.  Things not covered:   * How the intro point/rendezvous system works, including peer discovery    and etc (Assuming it is trivial to obtain lots of ECElgamal keys/IP    address:Port combinations of endpoints, it appears that it is    possible to use the CREATE/CREATED response to mount an UDP    amplification attack.  But I did not check how easy this would be to    mount in practice.)   * The bittorrent bits.   * The ""dispersy"" component beyond ""ok, at least the ECElgamal key    generation uses M2Crypto, assuming the horribly broken keygen code    (community.privatesemantic.crypto.ecelgamal.ecelgamal_init()) is    dead like I think it is"".  Recommendations:   * For users, ""don't"".  Cursory analysis found enough fundamental    flaws, and secure protocol design/implementation errors that I would    be reluctant to consider this secure, even if the known issues were    fixed.  It may be worth revisiting in several years when the    designers obtain more experience, and a thorough third party audit    of the improved code and design has been done.   * For the developers:     * Use a CSPRNG when doing key generation.  Neither GMP's LCG nor      Mersenne Twister are CSPRNGs, even if they are seeded from      ""StrongRandom"" that actually is a ""StrongRandom"" (rather than a      horrible misnomer).     * Add a construct similar to RELAY_EARLY.     * Add authenticated encryption to cell payload.  This will break      wire compatibility.     * Use constant time modular exponentiation.  As a matter of fact,      don't include your own implementations of ECElGamal, RSA, and      Diffie-Hellman.  Use well tested/known secure library code      instead.     * Blind RSA operations, use padding as appropriate.     * Fix the symmetric encryption somehow, after obtaining a in-depth      understanding of what things break security of the mode you wish      to use in various ways (Eg: IV/Nonce reuse).       See: http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/modes.pdf     * Instead of a DH + ElGamal handshake, consider Ntor.  Even with      GMPY, doing modular exponentiation is relatively CPU intensive,      and there is the threat of CPU exhaustion attacks here.     * Clean out all the dead code, after printing out copies to use to      scare small children.       Eg: Tribler/community/privatesemantic/crypto/elgamal.py     Most of the fixes require major revisions to the wire protocol.  As    it appears that there is no versioning, how that will be done is    left as an exercise for the student.     Alternatively, rebase the system on I2P.

","I actually agree with you pallidpallas in that filtering user names would be a stupid idea. All I was trying to say is that people shouldn't take offence to a nym used by an anonymous entity on a DW drug forum. Some people need to stop being so precious and look beyond ones choice of nym, however silly it may be.;Basically what I'm offended by is the dingleberry nuzzling suggestion that there SHOULD be a filter on ""appropriate"" vs. ""inappropriate"" usernames, which I'm sure the fucking poster would then like to extend to the shitstaining language we use on this motherfucking forum as a whole. It runs contrary to the overall cumguzzling atmosphere of DW - why come the fuck here where people buy drugs and steal cunting money and then call for censorship at the word ""anal,"" which is by the way a perfectly cocksucking fine word that's used by medical motherwhoring professionals daily without anyone running screaming into the everlovin' night?;And ""analsyrup"" is Fat Phil's ""special of the day"".

Good friday is a public holiday, but typically isn't observed by government organizations. Maybe the post office was open friday but closed early? I don't know about that one. If the package was still in NL past Monday, this would explain the delay, but I also read that PostNL (Netherlands postal service) runs tuesday-saturday. If this is the case, Monday being a holiday shouldn't have caused the delay.  Anyone have any ideas what's going on? How exactly does the NL post office run?

"The Hub Forums","Ava","5924.20","2014-12-01T19:05:33","Opsec incredibly overrated","Start Here/For Beginners"," Yes, the point IS moot, which is exactly my point.  Don't waste energy and increase paranoia by calling out someone you have no idea about as LE just because they say something you don't want to hear.   Good clarification, thanks!  That's why hidden volumes via TrueCrypt is the way to go.   Very interesting story, though it works against the ""work around PGP"" idea -- the way we use PGP on darknet markets could not be exploited that way unless the target of LE is a customer of a vendor rather than the vendor themselves.  Vendors never encrypt their own identifying data using a customers' public key, and we NEVER share a private key.  So unless LE already finds me they can't find me via my use of PGP.     I was really referring to someone doing something clearly illegal for which they would be arrested upon identification.  Greenwald and his crew are at least nominally protected by US law which is why they have not been arrested (yet).  This is a great thread!  ","Quote from: Ava on November 30, 2014, 05:18:26 pmThere are great questions raised in the interview which I am still working my way through.  I'll add a few points I think are relevant here.First of all its as likely any of us are LE as  @EvilGrin is.  With no evidence such accusations are juvenile and embarrassing for the one who makes them. Let's not kid ourselves... most LE infiltration operatives are successful because there is never any evidence that they are LE. So, in that sense at least, the point is moot -- there isn't any evidence, and there is never going to be any evidence, unless someone really fucks-up big-time. ;Quote from: Ava on November 30, 2014, 05:18:26 pmSecond of all, all this talk of opsec dos/don'ts and how necessary it is have nothing to do with the use of PGP.  LE cannot break strong encryption. Its mathematically proven, and there are hundreds of criminal cases wending their way through the courts the world over where LE would just love to decrypt that laptop's hard drive and can't.  There's even a specific question of whether a person can be forced to turn over a password to an encrypted file/drive that has not been thoroughly decided yet. Ava, that is true, in the United States -- in the UK, you can go to jail for two years for refusing to hand over your decrypted messages or decryption keys.  ;Quote from: Ava on November 30, 2014, 05:18:26 pmThat's a hell of a lot of LE FUD to protect their secret strong encryption decoder ring. To suggest that customers should not bother with PGP is to tell them that they should be comfortable with LE having proof they ordered illegal drugs, etc., from the darknet.  Whether LE tries to prosecute them with this info or not, there is no one that would raise their hand and say ""I'm not worried if LE has proof I ordered an ounce of indica from SR2, in fact the very idea warms my heart"". So please, lets just axe that bit of stupidity right off the bat. I think you may have misunderstand the Grugq's position -- I did as well, at first. I too, was upset (at first) by his apparent dismissal of PGP, until I understood what he was getting at. You're right... it is indisputable that LEA cannot break modern crypto -- almost no one disputes that. That said, both LEA and the intelligence agencies alike don't even bother to try to break it, for the most part. Rather, they by-pass it. Ed Snowden himself said that the end-points were very vulnerable, and that is where precisely where the attacks are taking place. Let me give you a concrete example that the Grugq has brought up in the past: The Grugq has blogged about the case of a particular pedophile ring, the ringleader of which was known by the handle Yardbird. The existence of this group had been intimated to the Australian police by the New Zealand authorities, who had detected a pattern of unusual encrypted traffic in certain Usenet newsgroups. Due to their heavy use of PGP, the operations of this ring were concealed from the police, until the police caught a very lucky break. One day, in Australia, a man was arrested on some sort of child ponography-related offence. This man, as it turned out, was a member of Yardbird's ring. Undoubtedly, as part of some sort of plea-deal, he revealed his membership in Yardbird's ring, and handed over his PGP key and passphrase. Apparently, Yardbird's ring used a shared PGP key, to which all members had both the public and private halves. With this information now in hand, the Australian police were now able to decrypt this encrypted message traffic, and observe the ring's activities first-hand. An officer assumed the arrested man's identity in the ring -- this was how the police managed to observe the ring's activities for a period of some 15 months. Despite the fact that PGP had been bypassed, and the authorities were able to observe the ring's activities, only about one-third of the ring's members were ever identified and apprehended. (All those positively identified were arrested, tried and convicted.) ;Quote from: Ava on November 30, 2014, 05:18:26 pmIf you think the NSA is targeting you, the only thing to do is destroy your computers and stay off the net, unless of course you can't, in which case I feel very sorry for you. I think it is only reasonable to think that Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, not to mention their various and sundry collabaorators are all targets of the NSA. It is worthy of note that they have not gone offline.  "

There is a lot of material in this thread and I will read it. But first:   Wrong. You don't know how wrong you are. Its not LE's job to uphold the law or make decisions on whether you are breaking a law or not. Their job is to get someone before a court hearing. A suspicion is enough.   Yes LE is usually not on a witch hunt, unless you happen to be a prominent politician, in which case someone will try to make an example out of you. Otherwise their activity revolves around catching a few grunts and making one of them squeal and turn. And they won't let you go even if you don't have anything to contribute. They found you, interviewed you, and to save face or justify their efforts they will charge you with something discovered during their ""interview"".

There is a growing awareness of the altered threat landscape, and the need for an improved security posture. For decades the hacker community has been myopically focused on SIGINT threats, the sorts of technical attacks that have technical solutions. The HUMINT threat has been misunderstood, or ignored completely. That is changing as the hacker community is starting to learn and practice counterintelligence.   It is a difficult transition though, as some core counterintelligence principles run directly counter to the hacker ethos. There are a lot of factors at play, but one of the important ones is that hacker culture is very much a research culture. There is a great deal of knowledge exchange that goes on rather freely within various segments of the community. The problem, of course, is that the trading of information, which is so central to hacker culture, is the antithesis of a strong security posture. Many hackers realize this, so they only share with trusted friends, who then only share with their trusted friends, who then... and then suddenly everyone is on lists and someone is going to jail.   Security conferences are important events for hackers where they disseminate their research and findings, and socialize. This makes these events very target rich environments for intelligence agencies looking to build dossiers on hackers. They can see who is socializing with whom, attempt to recruit people, elicit information on capabilities, install malware on computers, collect intel from computers, and so on. That hackers would expose themselves to these activities seems very counterproductive for robust security. What gives?   The hacker community has a slightly different set of moral and ethical guidelines than mainstream society, which leads to problems with the authorities. Broadly speaking, few hackers view breaking into a system as unethical or morally wrong. Damaging the system, stealing information, or otherwise abusing the system is wrong. Simply accessing it is a challenge. The police, of course, view things differently: an illegal act is an illegal act.   For hackers the secret knowledge that they discover from active research is something to be proud of, and so we're very excited to brag about our findings, activities or capabilities. This information is treated as something that will be kept within the community, bound by the FrieNDA. [19] Of course, this is all based on trust, which is a very dangerous foundation for any security system. As Dulles' says, the second greatest vice is vanity, the third is drink. Security conferences are not the places to avoid those vices!    So there is certainly this dynamic of wanting to brag about our discoveries from active research, but at the same time the tension of ""what will happen if this leaks?"". These days we know what will happen, over zealous law enforcement and prosecution: weev, [20] Aaron Schwartz, [21] Stephen Watt, [22] Dan Cuthbert, [23] etc. The authorities view hackers as modern day witches, something to be feared and destroyed. It is unfortunate for the hacker community in many ways. Intelligent people who could contribute to mainstream society have their lives destroyed. So the repercussions of what are generally harmless activities can be devastating and life altering. Unfortunately, the protections that hackers turn to tend to be technological, but the problem is humans.   The hacker community is easy prey for law enforcement and the intelligence community. Very few hackers are savvy enough to spot a recruitment pitch, or to understand that what they think is amusing others view as criminal. I think this is starting to change. These days there is a lot less discussion about illegal hacking of systems (whether for monetary gain or not), and more about how to protect against the massive Internet surveillance that has been made public.   In this, I think, the hacker community and the general public are finding a lot of common cause against the LE/IC. There is a lot of good that will come out of this realization that the technology of privacy is actually important and should be ubiquitous, and easy to use. The default should be secure. Of course, as we know, this won't help that much if someone is going around making basic OPSEC errors. So strong privacy protections for everyone will make the job of the LE/IC a bit harder, but it will also make everyone safer. I think that is a fair trade off.  Similarly, I think a lot of hackers would be quite happy to help the LE/IC community with technology support and ideas. The problem is that the relationship is a difficult one to establish. The IC is a black-hole, sucking in information and returning nothing. I don't know how there can be meaningful engagement between the two communities, which I believe is a tremendous shame. There is a lot that can be learned from both sides, and I would love for the IC to contribute back. Law enforcement doesn't interest me that much. Personally, my interest with LE begins and ends with studying their tools techniques and procedures for counterintelligence purposes. Something, that historically at least, few other hackers actually do. That is changing.  Hackers are learning to tighten up their security posture, they are learning about the tools techniques and procedures that get used against them, and they are learning how to protect themselves. Of course, the preponderance of criminal activity is committed in places where lax enforcement of computer crime laws allows blackhats to operate inside ""protected territory"". In the long term, this is an extremely dangerous situation for those guys, of course, because without an adversarial environment they won't learn how to operate securely. When the rules change, they will be caught out, completely unprepared.  The intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments have decades of organizational history and knowledge. The individual members can display wide ranges of skill and competence, but the resources and core knowledge of the organization dwarf what any individual hacker has available. Many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn, his clandestine tradecraft and OPSEC, are the sort of skills that organizations are excellent at developing and disseminating. These are not very good skill-sets for an individual to learn through trial and error, because those errors have significant negative consequences. An organization can afford to lose people as it learns how to deal with the adversary; but individual cannot afford to make a similar sacrifice -- after all, who would benefit from your negative example?  The skills that hackers do have, the highly technical capabilities they can bring to the game, are not useful against an adversary who's primary skill is manipulating other people. Knowing how to configure a firewall, use Tor, encrypt everything, etc. isn't going to do much good if you also attend a conference without a highly tuned functioning spook-dar and a working knowledge of anti-elicitation techniques. The hackers are hopelessly outclassed at this game. Hell, the majority of them don't even know that they're playing!  Times are changing though, and hackers are starting to learn: OPSEC will get you through times of no crypto better than crypto will get you through times of no OPSEC.

To suggest that customers should not bother with PGP is to tell them that they should be comfortable with LE having proof they ordered illegal drugs, etc., from the darknet.  Whether LE tries to prosecute them with this info or not, there is no one that would raise their hand and say ""I'm not worried if LE has proof I ordered an ounce of indica from SR2, in  fact the very idea warms my heart"".  So please, lets just axe that bit of stupidity right off the bat.  As for the myriad other questions and practices surrounding opsec, those are being discussed with nuance all over the darknet these days.  They are not idle chatter, and are not proven to be such just because opsec is not a simple recipe that never fails.  If LE wanted to find any vendor, and had a large amount of resources to devote to the subject and a few months time, they could do so.  But we don't live in that world.  If you look at the darknet vendors that have been taken down, they are the low hanging fruit.  And not because the opsec of the others is ironclad, but because its ""good enough"" to keep the always strapped for resources LE off their trail.  Note that notion of good enough, its discussed in the interview for a reason, and the answers given are the way we should all think about opsec because there is no 100% opsec that works for all situations:   If you think the NSA is targeting you, the only thing to do is destroy your computers and stay off the net, unless of course you can't, in which case I feel very sorry for you.  However, if you think the DEA/FBI wouldn't mind nabbing you if they could, but realistically there are a lot bigger fish in the sea, only small fractions of their budgets are actually devoted to darknet interdiction, and they just don't have the resources to go after all or even a significant number of you effectively, then your opsec situation becomes much more manageable, and using basic and common sense opsec is the difference between years in jail and a happy free life.  The reason we read those paranoid freak outs and don our proverbial tinfoil hats in jest whenever someone screams about the NSA's new quantum computers that don't exist is we have done as suggested and considered what the reasonable threats to our security are and dismissed that one and many others like it long ago.  If you want to understand your nemesis you must think like him, realize his limitations and capabilities, and keep them in mind or you will turn into a gibbering paranoid loony very quickly.  Good opsec works, and the posted interview serves to underline that fact very well.","""A risk assessment should focus on the most high impact items first. To determine this, you list your adversaries and group them by intent and capability. So the NSA would have a very high capability, but probably has a low intent of targeting you. Then you make a list of information about your secrets, what you are trying to protect, and group that based on the negative impact it would have if it were in the hands of an opponent. The most damaging information must be protected from the likely and the most capable adversaries."""

Grugq started his career at a Fortune 100 company, before transitioning to @stake, where he was forced to resign for publishing a Phrack article on anti-forensics. [2]  Since then the Grugq has presented on anti-forensics at dozens of international security conferences, as well as talks on numerous other security topics. As an independent information security consultant the Grugq has performed engagements for a wide range of customers, from startups to enterprises and the public sector. He has worked as a professional penetration tester, a developer, and a full time security researcher. The Grugq's research has always been heavily biased towards counterintelligence aspects of information security. [3] His research has been referenced in books, papers, magazines, and newspapers. Currently an independent researcher, the grugq is actively engaged in exploring the intersection of traditional tradecraft and the hacker skillset, [4] learning the techniques that covert organisations use to operate clandestinely and applying them to the Internet. You can follow him on Twitter at @thegrugq. [5]  John Little: You blog and have given conference presentations on Hacker OPSEC. [6] You started doing this before the recent NSA revelations (and the general hysteria surrounding intelligence collection) but you were already warning hackers that states had superseded them as the internet's apex predator. In just a couple of years we've moved from the seeming invincibility of LulzSec, [7] to high profile busts, and now onto serious concerns being raised about the every aspect of the internet's architecture, security models, and tools. Rock solid OPSEC is a refuge but maintaining it for long periods of time under significant pressure is very difficult. The deck is obviously stacked against anyone trying to evade state surveillance or prosecution so where do freedom fighters and those with less noble intentions go from here?  The Grugq: You raise a number of interesting points. I'll ramble on about them in a moment, but before that I'd like to clarify for your readers a bit about where I am coming from. Firstly, I am not a ""privacy advocate"", I am an information security researcher. My career in information security has been mostly focused around denial and deception at the technical level.   Recently, however, I became aware that this ""fetishizing the technology"" approach is simply not effective in the real world. So I turned to studying clandestine skills used in espionage and by illicit groups, such as narcotics cartels and terrorist groups. The tradecraft of these clandestine organizations is what I am trying to extract, inject with hacker growth hormone, and then teach to those who need real security: journalists; executives traveling to adversarial environments; silly kids making stupid life altering mistakes, etc.   The media has actually expressed a lot of interesting in improving their security posture, and I am engaged in helping some journalists develop good OPSEC habits. Or at least, learn what those habits would be, so they have some idea of what to aspire to. There is a strange intransigence with some who reject improved security with the line: ""but we're not criminals! Why do we need this?"" Well, the only answer I have is that OPSEC is prophylactic, you might not need it now, but when you do, you can't activate it retroactively. As I phrased it in my ""The Ten Hack Commandments"" -- be proactively paranoid, it doesn't work retroactively.  So, that's how I've arrived at hacker tradecraft, and where I'm trying to take it. On to the issues you've raised about good OPSEC and living a clandestine life.   The stress of the clandestine lifestyle is something that people tend to gloss over all too easily. This is an observation that comes up frequently in the literature about terrorist groups, espionage agents, and revolutionaries. There are a lot of compound issues which combine to make this sort of ""good OPSEC"" lifestyle very unhealthy for the human mind:   1.  Isolation 2.  Compartmentation of the ego 3.  Paranoia related stress  Isolation provides the strongest security, and all good security involves a significant investment in maintaining a low profile, ""going underground"", ""off the grid"", etc. This means that the clandestine operative has reduced visibility over the social and political landscape, and their telemetry will suffer. Degraded telemetry means they will be unable to self-correct and reorient to what is happening around them. If they are part of a cell, a group of operatives in communal isolation, they will tend to self reinforce their ideology. Effectively radicalizing and distancing themselves further from the mainstream norms of society. This additional isolation can create a feedback loop.   If the operative isn't living a completely isolated clandestine lifestyle in their Unabomber cabin, they will have to isolate parts of their individual selves to compartment the different aspects of their lives. There will be their normal public life, the one face they show to the world, and also a sharded ego with their clandestine life. Maintaining strict compartmentation of the mind is stressful, the sharded individual will be a sum less than the total of the parts.  As if that wasn't enough, there is the constant fear of discovery, that the clandestine cover will be stripped away by the adversary. This leaves the operative constantly fretting about the small details of each clandestine operational activity. Coupled with the compartmentalization of the self, the operative also has to stress about each non-operational activity, will this seemingly innocent action be the trigger that brings it all crashing down?   Seriously, maintaining a strong security posture for prolonged periods of time is an extremely stressful and difficult act. Operatives working for the intelligence agencies have a significantly easier time of it than those on the other side of the protection of the state: e.g. their agents; hackers; terrorists, and narcos. The ""legal"" operatives have peers that they can confide in and unwind with thanks to the protections of the nation state. The true clandestine agents must be guarded with their peers, the public and the adversary. Any peer might be an informant, either now or in the future. Opening up and being friendly with their peers is part of what lead to the unraveling of the lulzsec hacker group.   This leaves people who need to operate clandestinely and use the internet with a real problem. How can you be on the Internet and isolated? Well, compartmentation is the only answer, but it is expensive and fragile, even a single error or mistake can destroy the whole thing. This is why I've advocated that people who seek to operate clandestinely combine deception, that is, multiple covers, for their compartmented activities. It is possible to embed tripwires into the cover identities and be alerted when they're blown.   My thinking these days is that an operative must minimize the time that they are engaged in a clandestine operation. Something like the theory of special operations, the period of vulnerability only grows the longer the operation goes on. Clandestine operational activity must be compartmented, it must be planned, it must be short in duration, and it must be rehearsed (or at least, composed of habitual actions). It is possible to do, and I believe that even non-experts can pull it off, but it must be limited in scope and duration. Prolonged exposure to underground living is caustic to the soul.   John Little: There is a significant amount of paranoia circulating in hacker and activist communities right now. How much of it is justified? More importantly, how should people go about conducting a realistic personal risk assessment before they start piling on layer after layer of OPSEC? How can they strike that balance between the tedium and isolation and security that is ""good enough""?   The Grugq: There is certainly a great deal of paranoia, some of it justified, some of it unjustified, and some of it misdirected. I think it is important to remember that paranoia is unhealthy, it is paralyzing, it is divisive, and it is harmful to operational effectiveness. The goal to aim for is caution. Allowing the adversary to inflict paranoia on you, or your group, gives them an easy psychological operation ""win"". So lets drop the paranoia and figure out what security precautions we must take in order to operate safely and effectively.   As you bring up, the core to effective security is performing a risk assessment, deciding what information is most important to protect, and then developing mitigation strategies to safe guard that information. There are books and manuals that go into this in great depth, so I won't spend a lot of time on the details.   A risk assessment should focus on the most high impact items first. To determine this, you list your adversaries and group them by intent and capability. So the NSA would have a very high capability, but probably has a low intent of targeting you. Then you make a list of information about your secrets, what you are trying to protect, and group that based on the negative impact it would have if it were in the hands of an opponent. The most damaging information must be protected from the likely and the most capable adversaries.  Generally speaking, if you're engaged in a clandestine activity that you want to protect, the core information to secure is:   1.  Your identity 2.  Your clandestine activity 3.  Your association with the activity  So lets take the example of the Dread Pirate Roberts, who's been in the news recently after he got arrested. His adversaries were highly capable, including a wide range of law enforcement officials from across the globe. They were highly motivated, because DPR and his site were very high profile. So you have high capability, and high intent. Not looking good so far.   The information that was most important was his personal real world identity, followed by his location. Protecting that information would require:  1.  Robust compartmentation 2.  Reducing his exposure to the most capable adversaries (e.g. leave the USA) 3.  A strong disinformation campaign 4.  Limiting his time in ""the dragonworld"" (to use J. Bells' term for the underground)  For most people engaged in a clandestine activity this list is probably what they will want to follow. The exact mitigation enacted for each component in the list is case dependent. As we discussed earlier, and as you've said, we need to find a good balance between an aggressive security posture and living a rewarding life.   Remember, the goal is to reduce the quantity and the quality of information available to the adversary.  John Little: So a point which both of us comment on with some regularity is the fact that security is rooted in behavior rather than technology. That's always been true to some extent but never more than now. Tools are suspect, almost across the board. And a lot of assumptions about security have to be tossed aside. But one thing is certain, hackers adapt to the adversary. Terrorists do this well too. An attacker who can successfully parse all this and adapt is going to be a very significant threat. How can states counter the advanced threats? How can they counter hackers who know how to manage OPSEC and technical security to evade detection?   The Grugq: HUMINT. More of it.  The role of SIGINT [9] in intelligence has basically been this weird bubble, starting around WWII when the love of SIGINT started until recently, when some of the SIGINT capabilities are starting to go dark. SIGINT is much more attractive than HUMINT. [10] Signals don't lie. They don't forget. They don't show up late to meetings, or provided intelligence information that is deliberately deceptive. SIGINT is the heroin of intelligence collection. The whole world got hooked on it when they discovered it, and it has had a very good run... it will probably continue to be useful for decades more, but really... the real utility of SIGINT will start to diminish now. It has to. The amount of encryption being deployed means that many mass collection capabilities will start to go dark. I, of course, am in total favour of this. I think that the privacy and protection of the entire Internet are more important than the ability of the US government to model the ""chatter"" between everyone using the Internet. The reduced security that the US government has tried (and succeeded) to force on the entire world is makes all of us less safe against any adversary.   SIGINT is really the sort of intelligence collection technique that needs to lose its prominence in the pantheon of intelligence gods. It is very easy for a serious adversary to defeat: basic tradecraft from the days of Allen Dulles will work (leave the phone behind, have the meeting while taking a walk). This tradecraft technique is described by Dulles, in 50 year old KGB manuals, and by Hizbollah operatives last year. The only way to catch people who are capable of any sort of OPSEC / tradecraft is via: a) Mistakes that they make (very easy for amateurs to make mistakes), or b) Via HUMINT. Spies catch spies, as the saying goes. It might be updated to, spies catch clandestine operatives.   Historically, the value of HUMINT has been very hit and miss, but those ""hits"" are extremely valuable. The major successes of the Cold War were almost all the result of human beings who became spies for the opposition: Ames, [12] Hanssen, [13] Walker, [14] Howard, [15] Tolkachev, [16] etc. There are myriad cases with terrorist groups as well, informants is the best weapon against them. Relying on SIGINT is essentially relying on the adversary (terrorist groups) having poor tradecraft and terrible counterintelligence practices. This is simply not the case, at least not with sophisticated dangerous groups.   Double down on HUMINT and scale back SIGINT. SIGINT can be evaded, but HUMINT, essentially exploiting trust relationships, will always bite you in the ass.   John Little: Hackers are going to have to evolve in the same direction though aren't they? Technology isn't their salvation from an OPSEC perspective, in fact it is really the weakest link in their security model, so they will have to fully embrace good old-fashioned tradecraft and deception to avoid detection. Do you see an appreciation of that in the hacking community? It seems like a lot of big name hackers are still making fairly simple OPSEC mistakes.   The Grugq: Exactly, this is really the understanding that needs to sink in: technology alone will not save you. Hacker culture, almost by definition, is technology obsessed. We fetishize technology and gadgets, and this leads us to the deep-seated belief that if we just use the right tool, our problems will be solved. This mindset is fundamentally wrong. At best, I would call it misguided, but really I believe that most of the time it is actually counter productive.  Trust is the weakest link in the security chain, it is what will get you in the most trouble. This goes double for trusting in technology (even, as Bruce Schneier says ""trust the math""). Tech is not the path to security. Security comes from the way that you live your life, not the tools. The tools are simply enablers. They're utilities. OPSEC is a practice.   Expecting the tools to provide security for you is like buying a set of weights and then sitting around waiting for your fitness to improve. The fallacy that technology will provide the solution has to be seen for what it is, a false promise. There is nothing that will protect secrets better than not telling them to people!   Good OPSEC is founded on the same basic principles that have governed clandestine activities since the dawn of time. Hackers might be new, but good hackers require the same set of skills as the second oldest profession. Good OPSEC is timeless, and it stems from the application of the principles of clandestine operation, using caution and common sense.   The ""73 rules of spycraft"" [17] by Allen Dulles was written before the Internet, before hacker culture (even phreaker culture) existed. I believe it is one of the most valuable guides available to understanding how to implement OPSEC. (As an interesting aside, harking back to one of my previous points, Dulles recommends taking vacations to get away from the stress of ""work"".)   There are a lot of very public hackers who exhibit terrible security practices. Many of them are techno fetishists rather than espionage geeks, consequently they fail to understand how limited their knowledge is. Its the Dunning-Kruger effect [18] in full tilt. They don't do the research on their opposition and don't know what sort of techniques will be used against them. By the time they figure it out, they are usually just an opportunity for the rest of us to practice Lessons Learned analysis. Of course the great tragedy is that many of the hacker community suffer from hubris that prevents them from actually learning from other's failures.   A friend of mine paraphrase Brian Snow (formerly of the NSA) ""our security comes not from our expertise, but from the sufferance of our opposition"". As soon as the adversary is aware of the existence of secrets worth discovering, and has the resources available to pursue them, hackers rapidly learn how good their OPSEC is.   John Little: I've always been amazed at the very public profiles of some hackers, especially where conferences are concerned. Granted, most are legitimate security researchers but there are also many in the community who occupy a grey area that is guaranteed to draw attention from intelligence or law enforcement agencies. Are hackers largely underestimating the skill with which intelligence agencies can penetrate, encircle, and absorb aspects of their community? Are we in for significant changes in the relationship between IC/LE and hackers, how hackers view themselves from a security standpoint, and how hackers engage each other?   End of Part 1. ",""

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","5924.0","2014-11-30T19:50:27","Opsec incredibly overrated","Start Here/For Beginners"," Let's not kid ourselves... most LE infiltration operatives are successful because there is never any evidence that they are LE. So, in that sense at least, the point is moot -- there isn't any evidence, and there is never going to be any evidence, unless someone really fucks-up big-time.    Ava, that is true,  in the United States -- in the UK, you can go to jail for two years for refusing to hand over your decrypted messages or decryption keys.    I think you may have misunderstand the Grugq's position -- I did as well, at first. I too, was upset (at first) by his apparent dismissal of PGP, until I understood what he was getting at.   You're right... it is indisputable that LEA cannot break modern crypto -- almost no one disputes that. That said, both LEA and the intelligence agencies alike don't even bother to try to break it, for the most part. Rather, they by-pass it. Ed Snowden himself said that the end-points were very vulnerable, and that is where precisely where the attacks are taking place.   Let me give you a concrete example that the Grugq has brought up in the past:   The Grugq has blogged about the case of a particular pedophile ring, the ringleader of which was known by the handle Yardbird. The existence of this group had been intimated to the Australian police by the New Zealand authorities, who had detected a pattern of unusual encrypted traffic in certain Usenet newsgroups. Due to their heavy use of PGP, the operations of this ring were concealed from the police, until the police caught a very lucky break.   One day, in Australia, a man was arrested on some sort of child ponography-related offence. This man, as it turned out, was a member of Yardbird's ring. Undoubtedly, as part of some sort of plea-deal, he revealed his membership in Yardbird's ring, and handed over his PGP key and passphrase. Apparently, Yardbird's ring used a shared PGP key, to which all members had both the public and private halves. With this information now in hand, the Australian police were now able to decrypt this encrypted message traffic, and observe the ring's activities first-hand. An officer assumed the arrested man's identity in the ring -- this was how the police managed to observe the ring's activities for a period of some 15 months.   Despite the fact that PGP had been bypassed, and the authorities were able to observe the ring's activities, only about one-third of the ring's members were ever identified and apprehended. (All those positively identified were arrested, tried and convicted.)   All this, perhaps, puts into perspective the Grugq's statement that:   ""OPSEC will get you through times of no crypto better than crypto will get you through times of no OPSEC.""  I suppose one could re-phrase it thusly:   ""OPSEC will get you through times of no PGP better than PGP will get you through times of no OPSEC.""    I think it is only reasonable to think that Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, not to mention their various and sundry collabaorators are all targets of the NSA. It is worthy of note that they have not gone offline.    Agreed.   Zaphod ","There are great questions raised in the interview which I am still working my way through.  I'll add a few points I think are relevant here.First of all its as likely any of us are LE as  @EvilGrin is.  With no evidence such accusations are juvenile and embarrassing for the one who makes them. ;Second of all, all this talk of opsec dos/don'ts and how necessary it is have nothing to do with the use of PGP.  LE cannot break strong encryption. Its mathematically proven, and there are hundreds of criminal cases wending their way through the courts the world over where LE would just love to decrypt that laptop's hard drive and can't.  There's even a specific question of whether a person can be forced to turn over a password to an encrypted file/drive that has not been thoroughly decided yet. ;That's a hell of a lot of LE FUD to protect their secret strong encryption decoder ring. To suggest that customers should not bother with PGP is to tell them that they should be comfortable with LE having proof they ordered illegal drugs, etc., from the darknet.  Whether LE tries to prosecute them with this info or not, there is no one that would raise their hand and say ""I'm not worried if LE has proof I ordered an ounce of indica from SR2, in fact the very idea warms my heart"". So please, lets just axe that bit of stupidity right off the bat. ;As for the myriad other questions and practices surrounding opsec, those are being discussed with nuance all over the darknet these days.  They are not idle chatter, and are not proven to be such just because opsec is not a simple recipe that never fails.If LE wanted to find any vendor, and had a large amount of resources to devote to the subject and a few months time, they could do so.  But we don't live in that world.  If you look at the darknet vendors that have been taken down, they are the low hanging fruit.  And not because the opsec of the others is ironclad, but because its ""good enough"" to keep the always strapped for resources LE off their trail.  Note that notion of good enough, its discussed in the interview for a reason, and the answers given are the way we should all think about opsec because there is no 100% opsec that works for all situations: Quote""A risk assessment should focus on the most high impact items first.

The most damaging information must be protected from the likely and the most capable adversaries."";If you think the NSA is targeting you, the only thing to do is destroy your computers and stay off the net, unless of course you can't, in which case I feel very sorry for you. ;However, if you think the DEA/FBI wouldn't mind nabbing you if they could, but realistically there are a lot bigger fish in the sea, only small fractions of their budgets are actually devoted to darknet interdiction, and they just don't have the resources to go after all or even a significant number of you effectively, then your opsec situation becomes much more manageable, and using basic and common sense opsec is the difference between years in jail and a happy free life.  The reason we read those paranoid freak outs and don our proverbial tinfoil hats in jest whenever someone screams about the NSA's new quantum computers that don't exist is we have done as suggested and considered what the reasonable threats to our security are and dismissed that one and many others like it long ago.  If you want to understand your nemesis you must think like him, realize his limitations and capabilities, and keep them in mind or you will turn into a gibbering paranoid loony very quickly.  Good opsec works, and the posted interview serves to underline that fact very well.

(http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png)","Quote from: Ava on November 30, 2014, 05:18:26 pmThat's a hell of a lot of LE FUD to protect their secret strong encryption decoder ring. To suggest that customers should not bother with PGP is to tell them that they should be comfortable with LE having proof they ordered illegal drugs, etc., from the darknet.  Whether LE tries to prosecute them with this info or not, there is no one that would raise their hand and say ""I'm not worried if LE has proof I ordered an ounce of indica from SR2, in fact the very idea warms my heart"". So please, lets just axe that bit of stupidity right off the bat. I think you may have misunderstand the Grugq's position -- I did as well, at first. I too, was upset (at first) by his apparent dismissal of PGP, until I understood what he was getting at. You're right... it is indisputable that LEA cannot break modern crypto -- almost no one disputes that. That said, both LEA and the intelligence agencies alike don't even bother to try to break it, for the most part. Rather, they by-pass it. Ed Snowden himself said that the end-points were very vulnerable, and that is where precisely where the attacks are taking place."

Managed by the presiding presidential administration, the official website of the White House allows for the filing of public petitions on all manner of subjects, from whether Election Day should be a designated holiday to whether Alaska should secede from the US and join Russia.  Petitions that cross a certain threshold of signatures then generally garner a White House response.  Filed on 28th March, the new petition argues that the IRSâs recent ruling on digital currencies is âoverly burdensome,â and that by imposing capital gains on all transactions, the policy will hurt innovation in the sector. The positioning is not unlike the one voiced by major industry investors when defending against the prospect of new regulation earlier this year.  Reads the petition:      âThis treatment of VC is overly burdensome as it will create onerous record-keeping issues and unnecessary costs that will stifle the development and advancement of this important technology.â  To date, the IRS ruling has garnered varying responses. Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis has said that the classification affirms bitcoinâs status as digital gold, though others allege that the IRS notice will adversely affect many aspects of bitcoin ownership and use. More details  Perhaps the biggest impact the ruling will have is on bitcoinâs role in payments, as each transaction will require capital gains reporting.  While even bitcoinâs detractors view its underlying technology as perhaps its biggest advantage, the guidance seems to discourage its use as a payment system, a fact that the petition acknowledges.  Reads the petition:      âUnder this interpretation, when Bitcoin is spent, the owner will have the tenuous responsibility of calculating their capital gains or losses, as well as the Seller of the goods or services.â  Community response  The petition gained significant attention on Reddit this weekend, garnering nearly 200 comments from bitcoin users who greeted the initiative with varying amounts of enthusiasm. Many voiced uncertainty that the petition would be ultimately effective, while others took issue with what they considered the poor wording and limited argument of the petition itself. The petition was still circulating on social media as of 1st April.  Still, others like SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust CEO Barry Silbert suggest this ruling was the best possible outcome for the bitcoin community.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he acknowledged the ruling represents a short-term burden for the industry, but he says innovation will help bitcoin users abide by the new rules.      âIt clearly creates a new record-keeping requirement which in the near term is going to be overly burdensome, but Iâm highly confident that by tax time a year from now, there will be plenty of automated solutions that will eliminate any headaches of managing this process.â  To date, the petition has received only 403 signatures. Its goal is to obtain 100,000 signatures by 27th April. IRS asks for comment  Though the filing is a noteworthy sign of community concern, it is unclear how useful it will be given that the US Treasury Department and the IRS have asked the public for comments on the measure. Though, the petition could theoretically come to the attention of the IRS should it reach a sizable amount signatures.  The IRS would not comment on whether such a petition would or would not impact its decision, but stated that it considers information from a variety of sources when soliciting feedback for notices that have yet to become final rules.  Bitcoin users who are interested in providing feedback to the IRS may be better served by sending feedback via standard mail or by email to the government tax body. All entries will be posted for public inspection in their entirety.",""

Presumably, for some company 'ABC Enterprises', it would be preferable to have a bank account in the name of 'ABC Enterprises'.

I have no idea about Russian banks, or Cuban banks or Venezuelan banks etc. But perhaps their rules are more easy going for entrepreneurs. Perhaps someone who know.. could make a contribution here ?  It seems to me that there's definitely a gap in the market for a bank that is..  (1) online and  (2) accepts anonymous clients (ie. no id checks, no address details) perhaps one that offers (3) numbered accounts  (like those in Switzerland, Liechtenstein & the Vatican Bank)   Someone should just implement a bitcoin bank. Here.. i'm about to invent it... if it hasn't been invented before. A bitcoin bank is essentially a variant of a crypto exchange. 1. you can put in: usd/euro/yuan/btc/ltc/etc 2. you can take out: usd/euro/yuan/btc/ltc/etc 3. you can send crypto to an address you nominate. 4. you can send fiat to a bank account you nominate 5. you can send fiat or crypto to anyone with an account at the same bitcoin bank.  And what would make this transition of, say btc-e.com, from crypto exchange to bank, is if it decided to assign IBAN and BIC codes to each of it's members.  Similarly, if btcchina.com assigned IBAN and BIC codes to each of its members ... or ... if btcchina.com teamed up with  Bank of China of China Merchants Bank. Then wealth could flow more freely between these currencies.  Capitalists believe in free markets, right ?

The metadata associated with an email is not encrypted and can damage your anonymity seriously.   All email, including secure email, travels a client/server route. But the metadata used to send the email is not encrypted. Instead it must be received on a central server complete with information of the sender, receiver, time of transmission, and other information on the record. The concentration of this information at a central point makes it trivial for the metadata to be served up to the NSA or others who can discern enough detail to harm your anonymity.   You want to avoid metadata altogether? Start using Bitmessage for sensitive email. There is no metadata for NSA to collect and the transparent encryption Bitmessage uses is very strong. PGP would need an RSA key size of 15,360 bits to equal the security provided by the 512 bit ECC key size used by Bitmessage.   Bitmessage is easy to use, there is no steep learning curve as with PGP as messages are automatically encrypted/decrypted. I'm surprised it has not been adopted more widely.

Normally I would tell you to search your feelings, you know them to be true. But in this case, they have misguided you.There's much more to an email than just the message. Encrypting it isn't really hiding that much from the NSA. They are more concerned with metadata and the big picture. PGP will not save you from this.

It escapes me why it is     called ""safe-mail""    No kidding.  The fact that ""safe-mail"" has become the email provider of choice on Silk Road is a disaster in the making. I am reminded of nothing so much as the role Hushmail played in 2007, with the DEA's Operation Raw Deal (ORD).  In ORD, Hush provided the DEA with ""one stop shopping"" as it were, as all the suspects were using Hushmail. Buyers, sellers, sources of supply (SOSes) all conveniently gathered in one place -- it was a fucking turkey shoot!  The DEA boasted of having obtained in excess of 100,000 decrypted emails from Hush. Even as late as 2012 -- some 5 years later -- I was still hearing of busts taking place from the Hushmail data haul.  Sometime later this year, I think we're going to see history repeat itself, only this time, instead of Hushmail, it'll be Safe-Mail. Recent events will only make this more likely -- let me explain:  When SR1 went down, there was a frantic scramble on the part of buyers to locate vendor contact information, primarily email addresses. With the most recent events here on SR, we're seeing some people say, ""Fuck Markets!"" and vowing to conduct business over email. The loss of BMR and its Forum, and Utopia and its Forum will only exacerbate matters. As hacks and/or thefts proliferate, people are becoming leery of centralized marketplaces, so they are turning, in ever greater numbers, to older, alternative methods like email. Once again, the provider of choice seems to be Safe-Mail.  Accordingly, I suspect over the next few months, that there will be some changes to Safe-Mail's operations: we'll start seeing Tor exit nodes blocked, and perhaps even bridges. No doubt the Feds will put a bug in the ear of the Safe-Mail operators. Also, without a doubt, the carrot and the stick will be employed -- the carrot will be some type of financial incentive, and the stick will be the threat of prosecution, or some other type of governmental pressure (perhaps an audit?) for non-compliance.  So, as a result, when enough users are using Safe-Mail, then the operators suddenly make it difficult, if not impossible, to connect via Tor, meaning that the only way to connect will be directly (or via VPN) both of which mean that the user can be located/identified.  Religious use of PGP will blunt this threat somewhat, but not completely. If you can be located/identified, then you can be raided, and forced to give up your PGP secret key and passphrase. Case in point: Ross Ulbricht. You can bet that every encrypted message he ever received has now been decrypted, and is in the hands of the Feds.  It's going to be an interesting year.   ===========================================================================  A few days subsequent to writing this, some kind soul sent me a copy of  an article written by Runa A. Sandvik, writing for Forbes:    The Email Service The Dark Web Is Actually Using  As denizens of the dark web run from law enforcement's expanding crackdown on anonymous online services, they've found a new favorite email provider: a little known Israeli company called Safe-mail. Whether they've chosen wisely remains to be seen.  In July last year, while investigating a hosting company known for hosting child porn sites with thousands of users, the FBI incidentally seized the entire email database of a popular anonymous webmail service called TorMail. The service was frequently used by high-profile members of anonymous drug market sites, including Dread Pirate Robertsâthe operator of the Silk Road anonymous drug marketâand tony76, the vendor believed to have scammed users of up to a quarter million dollars in Bitcoin last year.  Login page for the Safe-mail web service  [image] Caption: Login page for the Safe-mail web service  On Aug. 5 of last year, Dread Pirate Roberts posted on the Silk Road forum advising users to think back on their TorMail usage and assume everything sent or received there without encryption could now be read by law enforcement. âI personally did not use the service for anything important, and hopefully neither did any of you,â he wrote.  The takedown of TorMail forced users to look for a new anonymous webmail provider; preferably a secure service outside the U.S., accepting of connections from the Tor network, and with lax registration requirements. Following many lengthy discussions on the Silk Road forum, it appears a large number of users decided to make Safe-mail, a provider of a âfree high security web-based email systemâ based in Jerusalem, Israel, the new king of email for the dark web.  Known users of the Safe-mail web service include operators, vendors and customers of the dark web's many drug market sites, journalists writing about the investigation into Silk Road, and BTCKing, the vendor who ran an underground anonymous Bitcoin exchange and allegedly worked with BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem to sell more than $1 million worth of Bitcoins to users of Silk Road.  According to a recent press release, Safe-mail Limited is a four-year-old company âspecializing in secure feature rich messaging systems.â The company describes its email service as âthe most secure, easy to use communication systemâ with an âencrypted mail system with collaboration features and document storage functions.â To sign up, the service only requires that users choose a username and password, providing a first and last name is optional.  When I reached out to Safe-mail for comment, Amiram Ofir, Safe-mail's President and CEO, responded in an email that the company and its employees âcertainly are not aware of any criminal activity,â adding that the company does âfollow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court. Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities.â It's worth noting, however, that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. in 1998. An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server, according to the criminal complaint of Sept. 27, 2013.  Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected, and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user-specific keys. When asked if Safe-mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non-Israeli law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, Ofir replied with a short âYes.â My followup email, asking if Safe-mail has the ability to decrypt information without a user's key, went unanswered.   Forbes is read by virtually every suit in existence, especially government  suits. If the strategy I outlined above hadn't occurred to them already,  you can bet your life that is has now.  Management may or may not have been ignorant of what's been going on of late, but they have a heads-up now.   The only question is Safe-Mail's management going to take pre-emptive action, or will they wait for LEA to call the tune?

I would strongly urge you to re-consider.   On January 31, 2014, Forbes contributer Runa A. Sandvik published an article entitled: ""The Email Service The Dark Web Is Actually Using"". You can read  this article at:   http://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2014/01/31/the-email-service-the-dark-web-is-actually-using/     You can bet your life that if Safe-Mail's owners/operators didn't know about any criminal activity before being contacted by Forbes, they sure as hell know about it now. They may or may not have known about the huge number of people from Silk Road (and other DNMs) using their service, but the Forbes article, if nothing else, will have forced them to take action, lest they be considered complict if they do nothing to curb such activity.   It would not surprise me in the slightest to learn that emails are now scanned for certain keywords; certain patterns of usage may now be flagged as well. On Agora, there is one vendor who claims his Safe-Mail account was disabled or shut-down, meaning he can no longer access it. My tests have shown this account is still active, meaning that messages sent to this account are likely being collected by the authorities.   For vendors especially, please remember that even if you use PGP, the header information is NOT encrypted or protected. The authorities, even if they cannot read your messages, nevertheless know who wrote to you (and when).   Spitfire    ","When I reached out to Safe-mail for comment, Amiram Ofir, Safe-mails President and CEO, responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity, adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court. Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities. Its worth noting, however, that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. in 1998. An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server, according to the criminal complaint of Sept. 27, 2013.Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected, and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user-specific keys. When asked if Safe-mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non-Israeli law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, Ofir replied with a short Yes. My followup email, asking if Safe-mail has the ability to decrypt information without a users key, went unanswered.

The only problem is that as the system partition is writable an attacker could tamper your system.   When using a DVD on each reboot you know that you have a clean system (as long as you used a clean image when burning the CD). You then can have an encrypted partition to store your files on a USB disk or a microSD. You'd then have to open it manually and work with text files or manually link folders you'd need during your cession.  You can always have a better OPSEC: TAILS on a DVD for internet access and a second offline computer to encrypt and decrypt documents, software isolation or physical isolation to protect your tor process, tor over VPN over anonymous wifi, 100% live DVD software isolation on top of some physical isolation on a system that can't be tampered with... possibilities are endless.   It's up to you to decide if it's worth it or not.  If you're a small time buyer. Don't worry. Tails is pretty good as it is. If you have fun working your OPSEC up, are a paranoid geek or a high profile target this might not be enough for you. If not, you'll probably fine.  On your VPN question: it will be needed only if you feel the need to hide the fact that you are using TOR to your ISP. That will do nothing more. If you use an anonymous wifi connection you probably don't need it.  Remember: don't tell too much on your setup. We don't need to know if you use a wireless connection or your own DSL router.

There are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just released that I will post here along with some information about each. I will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling.  First - Bitcoin Fog. It has been around since before Agora opened, and actually endorsed Agora when it did open. There have been scam reports but I believe them to be people spreading FUD. I and many others have used it many times and have never had a problem. If you have had bad experiences with Bitcoin Fog, post them here. Side note: there is a minimum 6 hour wait before you get all of your coins for tumbling security reasons. Fee: Randomized ~1% - ~3% Minimum withdrawal amount: 0.035 BTC  Bitcoin Fog: foggeddriztrcar2.onion  Second - Helix by Grams. Grams started in April of 2014 as a simple search engine for products on the markets. After a few months they started Helix and have since created many useful services such as TorAds, InfoDesk, and GramsFlow. Helix has a regular version which requires a grams account, and a light version which does not. The full version of Helix has more fine-tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction. In the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets 2 confirmations it sends the cleaned coins (in one transaction) to your specified address. In the light version it can take up to 2 hours but most transactions are completed within 30 minutes. Fee: 2.5% Minimum withdrawal amount: 0.02 BTC Maximum withdrawal amount: 21 BTC Helix account cost (not needed for Helix Light): 0.01 BTC  Helix: grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix  Third - Pay Shield by SIGAINT. SIGAINT has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on 16 June. I have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in 30 minutes. What's unique about Pay Shield is that it has a ""Pay someone with mixed coins"" feature. From their website: ""[Pay someone with mixed coins] is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy. Simply input the payees' Bitcoin address and the amount they expect and Pay Shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount."" Fee: Randomized ~1%  Pay Shield: payshld6oxbu5eft.onion  Now on to the free method. This is not recommended as a stand-alone method. There are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins - stores, casinos, exchanges, etc. I personally use casino websites - send in your BTC, play a few rounds (penny slots or you'll regret it) and send it to your final destination. You can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler. With exchanges, it's best to find one where you can send your BTC and convert to LTC or another currency, then back to BTC. ",""

It would be better to disable javascript to visit anything linked in this thread. (Click on the green onion > privacy and security settings > set it to high. Type ""about:config"" in the address bar, search for ""javascript.enabled"", set it to false - if using tails you'll have to do that again each time you reboot. Better be safe than sorry.)

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:37:34","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security","          So keep in mind that if you are a user of Silk Road, or any other form of activism, you never want to enter any identifying details about yourself online. Make it so that even if the NSA intercepted and decrypted, or compromised Silk Road that the only information they have against you is your username and password. How safe is that username and password? Does your password contain any identifying information? Is it the same password that you use for your personal email? Does it contain a name of somebody you know personally? Always keep all of these factors in mind.           Another step you must take, especially when communicating with other users on sites such as Silk Road is using PGP encryption. This is not always possible, such as in cases when you are logging into a website, filling out a form, logging into an email, etc.. Consider any type of information you enter into a website using plain text possibly compromised. Never put anything sensitive is any type of plain text format online. PGP comes into play because it uses a very strong method of encryption called cryptography. PGP stands for  Pretty Good Privacy, and it is used for encrypting, decrypting and signing texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.            For the more technical users, it uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography. For the less technical users, the process of encrypting messages using PGP is as follows. You create a private key and a public key. The public key is the key you give out to people you want to send you encrypted messages. Your private key, is kept privately by you. This private key is the only key that can unlock messages that were previously locked with your public key.           If you are still confused, think about it like this. Think about a public key that can go around locking boxes that are intended for you. Anyone can lock a box that is intended for you, but you are the only one with the key to unlock the box. Either if the person who sent you a message locked a box (message) with your public key, they themselves can not unlock it. Only the person possessing the private key can unlock it. If you wish to respond to this person, you must use their public key to encrypt the message you intend to send to them. And they themselves, use their own private key to decrypt the message you sent them.           If you are still with me, I am glad I haven't lost you yet. This is called cryptography and was designed so that anybody intercepting your message could not decrypt the message without your private key. Even if you yourself, lose your private key, there is no method of key recovery. You can consider that message locked forever. So how do you use PGP?            Well before we get to that, I want to introduce you to a  Live Operating System, which makes using PGP encryption and decryption very easy. A live operating system is an operating system that you can run on top of your current operating system. So for example, if you are a Windows user, you have 2 choices. You can download the live operating system, burn it to a CD or DVD and then boot your computer from that DVD or CD. This will make sure your computer run as if you have this operating system installed on your computer. However, if you remove the CD or DVD and reboot, then your computer will boot as normal. You can also use a USB drive to perform this same feature.           Secondly, you can run this live operating system in what's called a Virtual Box. The benefits of this are that you can run Windows simultaneously as you run this other operating system and you can easily switch back and forth between them without rebooting the computer. Both methods have their pros and cons. The pros of running a live CD boot, are that reduce the risk of having your computer compromised by viruses, malware and keyloggers that rely on Windows vulnerabilities to run.      If you are going to run this OS from a Virtual Box, I suggest downloading Virtual Box from Oracle. Note the  https://    https://www.virtualbox.org/     Next, the live operating system I would encourage you to use is  Tails. Tails can be found at the following website.  https://tails.boum.org/     The reason I choose Tails, is because it has many of the security features that you require to stay anonymous already installed. Some users are not happy with Tails, but it really is a great operating system loaded with security features. Many I will talk about in this series on security including PGP encryption and decryption. Make sure you download the Tails ISO file from the official Tails website and you can either load it into Virtual Box or burn it to a DVD or load it onto a USB and booting your computer from that drive.      There are plenty of tutorials on how to load Tails into Virtual Box, so I won't go into much detail other than, make sure you run Virtual Box and Tails from a USB drive or SD card. I would suggest a USB drive however for reasons I will explain later. But basically when when Virtual Box runs directly on your hard drive, it creates a virtual hard drive that is uses as a temporary hard drive while Tails is running. Once Tails is closed, this virtual drive is deleted, but it's not permanently deleted. As we know from the power of recovery tools, deleted files are easily recoverable with the right tools. I will talk about how to protect your files from data recovery tools in future posts but for now, just keep Virtual Box and Tails OFF of your hard drive, and load it either on a USB drive or SD card.     The same goes when booting your computer directly into Tails from a DVD or USB stick. Your hard drive will be used to store files used by Tails, so make sure any files that are saved or accessed using Tails are done from a USB stick or SD card, otherwise they will be recoverable. This is why I prefer using a Virtual Box and running both the Virtual Box and Tails inside of it, off of a USB stick. Keep as much as possible off of your actual hard drive. It is possible to shred files beyond recovery, but it's much easier to do this on a 16gb flash drive, then it is a 1 TB hard drive.      Next post we will get back on topic and start learning how to use PGP. The reason I have to take a detour to using Tails is because we will be using Tails for many of the features from here on out, including PGP.",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:40:56","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Welcome back again!     Now that we have PGP figured out, hopefully, I want to remind you that using PGP whenever possible, is very very very important. One of the pitfalls of Silk Road 1, is that some of the administrators, including Ross himself did not always communicate using PGP encryption. Once Ross was busted, they had access to his servers and his computers and anything that wasn't encrypted was wide open for them to look at. Most users on Silk Road 2 believe that Ross had stored personal information about some of Admins and Moderators on his computer in plain text that was used to make 3 more arrests of Silk Road users.      One of the reasons why I would suggest for you to store your PGP keys and other sensitive data on a SD card, is that if that day comes when you are compromised and you get a knock at your door, you have time to dispose of that SD card or USB drive quickly. Even better, if you have a micro SD card that plugs into an SD adapter, then you can snap it with your fingers or at the very least hide it. USBs would need to be smashed into pieces and it might not be easy to do this in the heat of the moment, so do what you feel best about. But always prepare for the day they might come for you.     But our next topic brings us to something called Whole Disk Encryption or Full Disk Encryption. From here on out I will refer to it as FDE (Full Disk Encryption). Tails has a FDE feature built into it, which is another reason why I encourage the use of Tails. It has many of these features to protect you. Essentially FDE will protect your drive, whether SD or USB from the people who may come for you one day. The method in which it does this is it formats your drive and rewrites the file system in an encrypted fashion so that it can be only be accessed by someone who has the pass phrase.      If you lose your passphrase, just like in PGP, there is no recovery. Your only choice is to format the drive and start over again. So make sure you remember it! And please for the love of God, Allah, Buddah, etc... don't store the passphrase on your hard drive somewhere. The tutorial on how to do this is located at the following webpage.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html     Again, always prepare for the day they come knocking, encrypt everything. Use PGP when communicating with others and always shred your files when finished with them. Which brings me to my next topic.  File shredding.     File shredding is extremely important and here is why. If you delete a file from your computer, you are only deleting where it is located on the drive. It is still on the actual drive, just it's location data has been removed. If you take a file recovery tool you can recover virtually any file that you have recently removed. File shredding combats this by overwriting files instead. The idea is that instead of removing the file's location, you need to overwrite the file with random data so that is becomes unrecoverable.      There are a lot of debate happening on whether you can overwrite a file once, or if you need to do it multiple times. Supposedly the NSA recommends 3 times, supposedly the Department of Defense recommends 7 times, and an old paper by a man named Peter Gutmann written in the 90's recommended 35 times. Needless to say, I personally think between 3-7 times is sufficient, and several people out there believe 1 time will get the job done.      The reasoning behind this is that some people believe the drive may miss some files the first time it over writes them and to be more complete, you should do multiple passes. Do what you feel most comfortable with, but I even think 3 passes would be sufficient, although it wouldn't hurt every now and then to run 7 passes and just leave it overnight.      The programs that can do file shredding are ones you will want to run from Windows or whatever operating system your computer is running. These programs can delete your files from your Recycling Bin, delete your temporary internet files and even Wipe your free disk space to make sure everything gets cleaned up. You always need to think, did I have any sensitive material on my hard drive? If so, maybe I need to shred my free disk space. When empting your Recycle Bin, you should always use a shredder. When only deleting under 1gb at a time, you can easily do 7 passes pretty quickly.      To put this in perspective, the leader of a group called LulzSec name Topiary has been banned as part of his sentence from using any type of file shredding applications so that if the FBI wants to check up on him, they can. File shredding keeps your deleted files actually deleted.   Here are some file shredding applications you can use.  http://www.dban.org/ http://www.fileshredder.org/ https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner  Next we're going to talk about removing harmful metadata from files, and some other topics as well.",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:42:31","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Next I want to talk about good practices when using TOR, Tails and other hidden services.      First of all, it is highly recommended that you use multiple identities online for different things. Perhaps if you are a buyer and a seller on Silk Road, you may want to have separate logins for this. And then possibly a third login for the forums. Then maybe you want to be part of another marketplace, then you might want a fourth login.      Well, Tails has another good program offered by Tails is called KeePassX. When you have multiple logins, it is hard to keep track of them all, so it might be a better idea to keep them all in 1 document that is encrypted with a strong password. KeePassX can help you with this.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords/index.en.html     You never want to use nicknames or locations, or anything else that is related to yourself online when you post or create usernames. And another thing you need to adopt are new ways of conducting yourself. If you are generally a messy typer, who makes the same grammar mistakes, or the same spelling mistakes all the time, this can be used to identify you. Always proof read anything you post publicly, or privately because the feds will always find ways to correlate things to you.      With Ross Ulbricht, they found an old post he posted on a forum when he first started Silk Road asking people if they had heard of a marketplace called Silk Road. Obviously this is an old trick used by people trying to spread awareness about a new project of theirs. Later he identified himself by saying he was looking for programmers and gave out his private email address on the same forum under the same name.      But if you always misspell the same words, if you always use the same slang terms, capitalize the same words, use a certain amount of periods after an etc.... or always use the same number of !!!!! then all of these things give them reasonable suspicion and it becomes easier to tie things to you. Once they have you under their radar, like they had Ross, it only took a few slip ups and he was theirs. Remember, you only have to make one mistake. So talking about your local election is a really dumb idea, get it?     Think about the time you use your computer. Is it easy to correlate your timezone based on the time you go online? Or is it more random? Do you have patterns that are predictable? Always think about these things when you post online. Always think about what type of personality you are putting out there about your online name.      Expect that every single word you type online is being read by the Feds. To them, this is much easier than tracking drug lords on the streets. They sit in an office and read forum posts and try and make connections. Don't underestimate the feds. Always treat everything as compromised, always treat everybody as compromised and don't ever think anybody will ever go to jail for you. If somebody can avoid 10-20 years by ratting you out, they will do it in a heart beat.      The perfect example is Sabu from LulzSec. After he was busted and facing 112 years in jail, they made him a deal to help them rat out his friends and he ended up getting many of his ""friends"" arrested. Even people who are your friends will turn their backs on you when it comes down to their freedom.",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:43:58","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Next entry into the series on security is how to handle getting caught.     Let us face it. We are all human and we make mistakes. Unfortunately, you only need to make one mistake, and the Law Enforcement, commonly referred to as LE on these forums can bust you. Maybe they will wait for you to do something more serious before they nab you, but if you slip up and they feel you are worth going after, you can expect them to get you no matter where you live, with rare exception.     The first thing I want to do is link you to another thread I just came across on these forums.  https://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13093.0  The main question is, should I keep an emergency lawyer fund on hand? And how much should it be. The response I think was most appropriate for this question was the following.      Once you get arrested by  LE, they can seize your money based on the assumption that it is drug related. So you need to have a lawyer paid for ahead of time. That way, in the unfortunate case that you get a visit from the feds, you have a lawyer ready to go. The agreed upon amount was around $50,000.   Next I want to talk to you about what to do in case you get interrogated by  LE. There is a great thread about this.  https://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=4461.0     The take homes from this thread are basically. Keep your moouth shut. The feds are going to try all types of tactics on you to get you to admit to guilt of the crimes you are being accused of. They will likely use the good cop, bad cop on you. First they will tell you that they want to help you, and that they are after the big guys. They just need your help to put away the big guys. Do not listen to this, I have never cooperated with a good cop LE and have it end up working in my favor. Once you admit to being guilty, you can kiss your freedom good bye.     Secondly, if you refuse to cooperate, their attitude will change to bad cop. They will say, ""OK fine, you do not want to cooperate? I tried to help but now you are going to be in a lot of trouble. Do you have any idea what kind of charges you are facing? You are going away for a long time unless you start talking.""     They are going to try and scare you into admitting guilt. Again, keep your mouth shut and continue to ask for a lawyer, hopefully the one you put on a $50,000 retainer prior to this happening. Never speak without a lawyer present and never do anything you do not have to do legally. If you have the right to remain silent, then exercise that right. I know there are some circumstances in which you do not have that right, but unless that is the case, you are better off staying quiet.     Third, drop the attitude. Do not argue with the cops about having  nothing on you, or something for that matter. Act scared, anxious and confused. Act like you have no idea what is going on and that you are scared for your life. Tell the cops they are scaring you and you want to see your lawyer because you do not know what this is about. They need evidence, and solid evidence at that, to charge you with a crime.      They are going to try and correlate posts you made on forums, phone numbers you called, perhaps a package shipped to your home, all forms of communication, bank transfers, and so forth, until they can find a way to link you to the crime you are being accused of. But the biggest piece of evidence will always be your willingness to admit your guilt for a lesser sentence.      When Sabu found that he was facing 112 years in federal prison, he quickly spilled everything and started working for the feds. Again, talk to your lawyer, find out the evidence against you and only answers questions your lawyer advises you to answer, and answer them in a way your lawyer advises you to answer them.      Try and be as honest as possible with your lawyer. Your lawyer can not and will not share any admittance of guilt you have with the prosecutors or  LE, this is called Attorney-client privilege. Please note there are a few instances where this does not apply.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%E2%80%93client_privilege#When_the_privilege_may_not_apply","Give your lawyer 50k and put him on a retainer.Don't have a emergency fund 'stash' lying around if that is what you mean.... you should already have your lawyer paid + plus extra in case he needs to post bond for you and they seize the majority of your drug funds."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:45:46","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Ok, now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a VPN over TOR.      The data flow would look like this. You -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet     The benefits of doing that are as follows. You are more anonymous to your VPN in case they happen to keep logs, or if you do something using the VPN that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your VPN IP address. In the case of this happening, even if the VPN manages to keep logs of everything you do, they can only identify you as an anonymous TOR user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or Paypal account. If you use Bitcoin, and made sure the the Bitcoin trail is not easily traceable you should be okay. Some websites block TOR users from connecting to their websites or servers, by using your VPN to appear as the exit node, you are hiding your TOR activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters.     Another advantage, is that if your VPN connection does drop, your fall back will be your TOR IP address instead of your real IP address. And finally, if you are passing through a compromised TOR exit node, your information will remain encrypted through the VPN's encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the VPN. This is a good thing if you are passing through a compromised exit node, but do not forget that the VPN could be logging everything you are doing anyways.  Do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data!     A few of the downsides of doing things this way, as mentioned in the previous post are that your ISP knows you are using TOR, when and for how long. This may or may not matter to you, but it is just something to consider. Second, you will be unable to visit hidden services websites. Remember those  .onion sites we talked about in the beginning? You need to be connected to the TOR network to visit those hidden service websites.       But I am connected to TOR aren't I? Yes you are, but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the TOR network, it comes from your VPN. And your VPN is likely not configured for TOR. In order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services, you must either be connected directly to TOR, or use a VPN to connect to TOR. TOR must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites.      The choice is ultimately up to you, and every person in every state, province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do VPN to TOR or TOR to VPN, or just TOR, or just VPN. Whatever choice you make, please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind. None of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online. Do not log into your Facebook account using your VPN. Do not check your email or search a nearby address on Google using your VPN. In fact, stay away from Google altogether unless absolutely necessary.     There are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users.      #1 - DuckDuckGo. They have both a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL for both types of users.    https://www.duckduckgo.com    http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ - Please note the hidden services mirror is not HTTPS     #2 - StartPage. This server also does not store any information about its users.    https://www.startpage.com     Before we move on, I want to go back to how to choose a good VPN. When looking for a VPN provider, you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from. Find out which one your VPN provider is using before you sign up with them. PPTP and OpenVPN. At this time, I am going to highly recommend that you avoid PPTP and stick with OpenVPN providers. Check out this site for a quick comparison.  http://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn/openvpn-vs-pptp     As you can see, PPTP uses a weaker encryption, 128-bit versus 160-bit to 256-bit for OpenVPN. It offers basic security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates. This is basically a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your VPN provider and not injected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates, similar to showing your ID to get into a a restricted area.     The only downside is that setting up OpenVPN can be a little challenging for the less technical users, but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up OpenVPN providers and your VPN provider itself will likely help you get set up as well. PPTP has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security, so I would recommend to avoid it. A third option for VPN providers is L2TP/IPsec, but many users now believe it has also been compromised by the NSA due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well.  Stick with OpenVPN.     Lastly, if you want to know how to connect to TOR over a VPN. If you are using OpenVPN like I recommended, then you it is really quite simple. Make sure you are connected to your VPN, check your IP address to on any website such as  WhatIsMyIpAddress.com to make sure it has changed. Then, open TOR or open TAILS and start using TOR and you are now connected to TOR over a VPN.      Connecting to a VPN over TOR is a more tricky and currently above my skill set since OpenVPN reconfigures your network routes so Tor can't be running on the same host. As soon as I figure it out, I will post a tutorial, and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a VPN over TOR, then please share it with this thread.    UPDATE  A method of connecting to a VPN over TOR has been added to this thread but is currently only able to be used by Windows users. You can read it about it at the link below.   After a long search, I have found a way you can connect TOR -> VPN. It is not perfect, and some might not agree with doing things this way, but it works and I am giving it to you as an option, but it only works for Windows users at this time.     If you look back at my previous posts regarding combining VPN and TOR then you will find the reasons why you would want to do so, and some of the reasons why you might not want to do it. But I was unable to provide you with a way to connect to a VPN using TOR so that the VPN does not know who you are. When it comes to TOR -> VPN, if you cannot trust your VPN, which you rarely should, then keeping your identity anonymous from your VPN is a good idea. Also, with more and more people using TOR, but with only around 4000 TOR exit nodes, many of the exit node IP addresses are being flagged as spammers on popular websites and limiting the usage of well meaning TOR users to post on message boards like Stack Exchange and so forth.     The way that I found you can do TOR -> VPN is by using a virtual machine, preferrably Virtual Box and running another instance of Windows, preferrably one that uses less memory than your current version. You also want to run TOR Expert and Tortilla on your host OS. I talk about how to do this in previous posts. Next set your Virtual Box to route all it's network traffic through Tortilla (bridge adapter), which routes it all through TOR. Currently Tortilla is only supported by Windows, which is why this option is only available to Windows users at this time. Doing this also makes it easier to do things like watch videos on YouTube.      Now that you have your Windows Virtual Machine running on TOR, you can install a VPN of your choice, preferrably one using OpenVPN on your Windows Guest OS and connect to it. Check your IP address before connecting and after and you should see a different IP address. If all went well, you now have a virtual machine running TOR -> VPN. Then if you want to add another layer, you can download TOR browser bundle onto your virtual machine and run that as well giving you TOR -> VPN -> TOR for another layer of security.  Also you have the option using this method to use a VPN on your host OS, then Tor Expert with Tortilla, then another VPN on your guest OS, then TOR browser, giving you VPN -> TOR -> VPN -> TOR.     I am not advocating any whcih method, you need to make that decision on your own, I am just giving you the knowledge necesary to make an informed decison and you can ultimately choose which method you feel most comfortable with. Sometimes doing TOR -> VPN is necessary because of the spam filter reasons I mentioned above and other times having TOR as your last node to the internet is necessary like when accessing the onion network. It is completely up to you and I know that we are trying to shy away from Windows usage because of all the exploits and other reasons spoken about in the previous posts, but if you have no other way of staying anonymous from your VPN than this, then I think it is a good compromise until we have something like Tortilla that is compatible with Linux distributions.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:48:04","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," A little change of pace for this next post. I want to talk about one of our fallen moderators Libertas.     It has finally been confirmed, what we all were hoping for that  Libertas, one of the 3 arrested moderators was released on bail recently according to an article.  http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/the-silk-roads-libertas-is-free-to-the-annoyance-of-us-authorities/      So as you can see, just because Libertas was a moderator on the site, he is being charged with allowing transactions to faciliate sales of drugs. He is basically being charged as a drug dealer.      He unfortunately was found with drugs on him at the time of his arrest, which made things much easier to keep him in custody. And it turns out that the alleged former owner of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht is fully complying with law enforcement to attempt to identify senior vendors on Silk Road. According to the article, Ross communicated with the vendors frequently and likely in plain text (is my guess).      The reason I bring this up, is that we need to remind every user on here of the mistakes that were made by Ross, and the other three moderators so that we can hopefully learn from them. We need to avoid these types of mistakes, never ever EVER give anybody any personal information about yourself online. The story goes, that Ross required moderators to give him copies of their IDs in order to become moderators of Silk Road, and he likely kept a record of these on his computer. Unfortunately, these are now in the hands of the FBI and 3 moderators have been arrested as a result since. And now, according to the article, they are after senior vendors as well.     A few take homes are; Always use PGP encryption in all your communications, which unfortunately in this case would not have mattered because Ross ended up giving up his private keys to the feds. But it is still another hurdle in their way to protect you from them taking away your freedom. Never give out any personal information to anybody online about yourself. Never put your trust in somebody else's hands, because at the end of the day, nobody is going to go to jail for you. Ross found an opportunity to possibly reduce his sentence and he is fully taking advantage of the opportunity.     This exact same scenario happened with Sabu from LulzSec was threatened with 112 years in prison, he quickly turned on all his friends and worked with the feds to get them all locked up to help reduce his sentence. Sabu has 2 kids and obviously decided he would rather snitch out his friends and have a chance at being a father rather than spend the rest of his life locked up in jail. Again,  nobody is going to go to jail for you. ","The Silk Road moderator Gary Davis, aka Libertas, is officially free on bail and awaiting an extradition hearing on February 13.The FBI flew to Ireland that night for the express purpose of taking Davis into custody and interrogating him in Ireland, with regard to his position and functions being a moderator on a website allowing transactions to facilitate the sale of drugs online.;However, Davis was found in possession of illicit substances which could result in a minimum sentence."

According to this article.     http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/stakeout-how-the-fbi-tracked-and-busted-a-chicago-anon/      So we see here Sabu is chatting with a user  sup_g to try and engage him about the hacks that took place.   And more details on how they looked through copious amounts of logs to correlate this user  sup_g to his real identity.      This is why you all need to be extra paranoid with every single thing you say about yourselves on this forum. I have seen people talking about what country they live in, some even talking about which state they live in. If you think that the FBI will never put the pieces together, you may be sadly mistaken as Jeremy Hammond found out.      If this does not open your eyes to some of the mistakes many of you have been making online, then you need to reevaluate how you handle yourselves online. Read the entire article to get a better picture, but remember, I do not care if it is your best friend from elementary school, do not, under any circumstances ever admit anything online to anybody. Never under any circumstances take credit for any freedom fighting or hacktivism you have participated it online. And for christ's sake, NEVER log into a server, especially one that keeps logs with your real IP address! ","The day after Christmas, sup_g had another online chat about the Stratfor hack and about some 30,000 credit card numbers that had been taken from the company. His interlocutor, CW-1, engaged in a bit of gallows humor about what might happen should they all get caught.But the raid had, in fact, already happened. CW-1 was ""Sabu,"" a top Anon/LulzSec hacker who was in real life an unemployed 28-year old living in New York City public housing. His sixth-floor apartment had been visited by the FBI in June 2011, and Sabu had been arrested and ""turned."" For months, he had been an FBI informant, watched 24 hours a day by an agent and using a government issued laptop that logged everything he did. ;Sabu suddenly addresses sup_g by a new name, ""anarchaos."" It would turn out that sup_g went by many names, including ""anarchaos,"" ""burn,"" ""yohoho,"" ""POW,"" ""tylerknowsthis,"" and ""crediblethreat."" CW-1: if I get raided anarchaos your job is to cause havok in my honorCW-1: <3CW-1: sup_g:@sup_g: it shall be soNormally, the attempt to link his various names would have raised the hacker's guard; as he confided to Sabu, someone else had once tried to link the names ""yohoho"" and ""burn,"" but the hacker ""never answered... I think he picked up some language similarities I've worked with [REDACTED] on other ops in the past."" But this was Sabu, a sort of hacker demigod in the world of Anonymous. If you couldn't trust him, who could you trust? Sabu had even provided a server to store the stolen Statfor data, so he couldn't be a fed (in reality, he had done so at the FBI's direction).;To identify sup_g, the Bureau first turned to the voluminous chat logs stored on Sabu's computer. They went through every comment that could be plausibly linked to sup_g or one of his aliases. The goal was to see if the hacker had slipped up at any point and revealed some personal information.He had. On August 29, 2011 at 8:37 AM, ""burn"" said in an IRC channel that ""some comrades of mine were arrested in St. Louis a few weeks ago... for midwestrising tar sands work."" If accurate, this might place ""burn"" in the Midwest. FBI Chicago agents were able to confirm that an event called Midwest Rising was attended by Chicago resident Jeremy Hammond's twin brother. (Hammond had a history with anarchism and violent protest.)""Anarchaos"" once let slip that he had been arrested in 2004 for protesting at the Republican National Convention in New York City. Much later, ""yohoho"" noted that he hadn't been to New York ""since the RNC,"" nicely tying both online handles to the same person. The FBI went to New York City police and obtained a list of every individual detained at the 2004 convention; they learned that Jeremy Hammond had in fact been detained, though he had not been arrested. The pieces were starting to fit.""Sup_g"" and ""burn"" both indicated later that they had spent time in prison, with burn indicating that he had been at a federal penitentiary. A search of Hammond's criminal records revealed that he had been arrested in March 2005 by the Chicago FBI and had pled guilty to hacking into a politically conservative website and stealing its computer database, including credit card information, according to an FBI affidavit. Hammond was sentenced to two years in prison for the action.In yet another chat, ""Anarchaos"" told Sabu that he had once spent a few weeks in a county jail for possession of marijuana. He also asked Sabu not to tell anybody, cause it could compromise my identity,"" and he noted that he was on probation. Both matched Hammond, who was placed on probation in November 2010 after a violent protest against the Olympics coming to Chicago. When the FBI ran a criminal history check on Hammond, it also revealed two arrests for marijuana possession.The FBI was so thorough that it even followed up on a ""POW"" comment saying ""dumpster diving is all good i'm a freegan goddess."" (""Freegans"" scavenge unspoiled, wasted food from the trash of grocery stores and restaurants.) The FBI went to Chicago authorities, who had put Hammond under surveillance when they were investigating him back in 2005. As part of that earlier surveillance, agents have seen Hammond going into dumpsters to get food.Now that they had a suspect, it was time to put him under surveillance.;Watching the WiFi network revealed the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of each device connected to the network. Most of the time there was only one, an Apple Computerand sup_g had told Sabu that he used a Macbook. On March 1, the agents obtained a court order allowing them to use a ""pen register/trap and trace"" device that could reveal only ""addressing information"" and not content. In other words, if it worked, agents could see what IP addresses Hammond was visiting, but they would see nothing else.His Macbook's MAC address was soon seen connecting to IP addresses known to be part of the Tor anonymizing network.And while this definitely sounded like their man, the Bureau went to even greater lengths to double-check their target. The main technique was to observe when Hammond left his home, then to call Sabu in New York and ask if any of Hammond's suspected aliases had just left IRC or the Jabber instant messaging system. "

For reasons we spoke about earlier, you do not want to give any law enforcement the ability to see when you log on and log off.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:01:23","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Here is another fun tip that may or may not interest you, but I figured I would throw it in for you anyways.     I figured this out while trying to figure out an effective way to do a TOR -> VPN connection. You can do TOR -> TOR connection with Tails by using a program called  Tortilla, thus adding another layer for your adversaries to crack. Whether or not this is worth it, is completely up to you, but I am sharing in case it is something you want to do. This however currently only works for those using Windows because it was designed to be used by Windows users. Please note as well that this will noticeably slow down your connection since you are going through TOR twice. Here is the official homepage of Tortilla.  https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Tortilla     And the official download page for the prebuilt standalone exe below. There is a link to it on the home page if you do not trust me.  http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools/     The way you do this is very simple actually. You need to first download  TOR Expert Bundle from the TOR Project download page and install it on your computer or better yet your USB drive.  https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en     Next open the  tor.exe and just let it run until it says  Bootstrapped 100% Done. Next you want to run the tortilla.exe file and make sure you run it with Administrator privileges. Also, if you are running Windows Vista or later, you will likely get an error that this program does not have a valid certificate, because it is actually signed with something called a test-signed ceritifcate. In this case you need to allow test-signed drivers to run on your computer.      To do this, simply go to your Start Menu and type in the search box ""command"". When command comes up, you right click it, and click run as Administrator and it will open up a command prompt. Next type in the following command.  Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON and this will allow Windows to install test-signed drivers. Restart your computer and you will see in the bottom right hand corner after you restart  Test Mode Windows. Now you can run Tortilla. And let it connect to TOR. Remember to have  tor.exe from TOR Expert Bundle open first.     Finally, you open up Virtual Box or whatever Virtual Machine software you are using and click  Settings on the Tails virtual machine. Click on the  Network tab and change the drop down menu where it says  Attached To: to  Bridged Adapter and in the drop down menu below it called Name: Select Tortilla Adapter. Now your Virtual Machine, in this case Tails, will always connect to the internet  through Tortilla, which connects through TOR. And since Tails establishes its own connection to TOR, you will be running TOR over top of TOR. Again, you may or may not want to do this, but I am giving you the option should you want to.       If anyone is interested in learning more about the creator of Tortilla, he did a PowerPoint presentation at the 2013 Black Hat USA conference. Feel free to watch his talk at the YouTube link below. Please note however that YouTube is owned by Google and there are only about 57 views on the video, so the government will likely correlate users who watch that video with users from this forum. Make sure you do not watch the video on YouTube with your real IP address. At the very least use a VPN or find another site that has it hosted. Always be extra paranoid.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_jDPQU-8YQ ",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:03:07","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Since we just finished a section on verifying downloads with signatures and public keys, I figured we should do a quick post on verifying messages by using the same two things, signatures and public keys.     Now for those of you who are members of the Silk Road Forums, you will notice that some people, mainly Moderators like to sign their messages with signatures. Let us look at an example of a signed message from Dread Pirate Roberts. The last message he left before going on his leave of absence.       So why should you care about this? What is the significance of signing a message? The reason is, in case somebody were to compromise DPR's account, due to having a weak password or possibly an exploit in the forum's coding, then the person would not be able to sign the messages without access to DPR's private key. So let us look at how we can verify this message left by DPR. First of all you need to visit Dread Pirate Roberts' profile page and grab his PGP public key. I am not going to post the key here for space reasons, but just visit his page at the following URL and import that key into your keyring.  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=1     Next, highlight the entire PGP signed message from top to bottom and copy it to your clipboard (Right click, Copy). You will see your little Clipboard icon in the top right of Tails turn red. Click on that clipboard and select  Decrypt/Verify. You should get the following results. One in the window on top and the other on the bottom.      Again we get the same warning we did when verifying our downloads, saying we have not verified that the PGP public key is authentic. We can see the signature name was made by Dread Pirate Roberts and the comment section has the Silk Road URL, so far so good. Now remember when we verified TOR? We wanted to check out the fingerprints to see if they matched. We do this by going to our key ring (Manage Keys), and selecting DPR's key, right clicking it and going to properties. Now move to the tab  Details and look under where it says Fingerprint: and compare the numbers in there to the numbers we got when we verified the signature. They should be the following.   5A48 F5D0 50E9 9052 62B4799D CCB2 38E4 7CFE DFBC     We have ourselves a match! So unless DPR's private key was compromised, we know that he himself was the one who wrote that message. So now you see why some people decide to sign their messages. It is a way of verifying that their account has not been compromised by verifying that the person in control of the account is the same person that is in control of the PGP private key.     Do you want to learn how to sign a message? It is very easy. Open up gedit Text Editor and type in a message. Next, select the message and copy it to your clipboard (Right Click - Copy) and then click on your clipboard icon up top and choose  Sign/Encrypt Clipboard with Public Keys. Do not choose a key from your list of PGP public keys unless you want to encrypt the message. If you want to encrypt the message to send to somebody's inbox or so that only one person can view it, then select their name and it will encrypt it with their PGP public key. In our case, we just want to sign the message without encrypting it, but you can certainly do both at the same time if you wanted to.     If you look down near the bottom you will see where it says  Sign message as: click on this and select your personal key. It will ask you for your passphrase because remember you are signing this with your private key. Once you enter it correctly, the PGP signed message will be copied to your clipboard and you can paste it anywhere (Right Click - Paste) that you want to. Here it what mine looked like.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA512  This is my PGP signed message for demonstration purposes. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJS0GiWAAoJEPuh6tSg81nyqXAP/2mEqvk9RP0FEHZi3edH9faV OmDoOostmzm90nGMGOOu4cuG0M6jgl7R3hfUZBE6zCh59MG8a9EDuUzpIT3U5nfd zS0GWtzUQKGXPXfJ1OvWlsA6Sm7TsEsviBBz5DJxyVLcJGNU6OLUVm7onxBLwfTq D1jAATIB43WJbDrq3XY9MF9GCoOLlcLeKNVa4m0JF582IvQJ05mSZXeXCueImvol FaflpLW5MKyJJ92a8uheB0pLHUQTLr6jZn6TcfKY9dK8puOam5k2TGut/Sm47uqc aMA1trXw4xntww/8X4QyL5SbSN7QVOFsy/g0b3Grp5OrConsfnsUoeRH5ArnxY0W ijPl92aTbZazvXspW2REkJ3yq+fWjuGrYHw8m7/YVBig+OSMuBUXhSE5Pjq95fyM bA1P7rF2fi7eRsl1z0qyETV3Bs1RltwvBUVIwj3SZNeVVoG5cHgpiPgGFq4S9Qke unIFeHy3YpBk90kLA1n8n61VnkKAUy0Dt9AoTJloeOqPtcgeKHVsFzxdPCBcSwqd XYnIx4lNeaw4OvHYgZsCMvFlUItSBGnFWLN9foQ8UybAUPGI9Z4sK2WmtyWK4fLl cXnYY9zt56Ji4DiVsQrEUamNTQEDGxpvBL/kQKRMKN6HviEXW+qr57LAo6t6sTQw KTV4uJkH1JxuOOhN9tIe =Nkox -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----     And if you want to verify it, check out my PGP public key in my profile and verify my PGP signature against my key! It is really that simple. But you might be asking, cannot somebody just change the message and copy the signature? No, changing the message will change the signature because the signature depends on both the message and the PGP private key. So if you change one single character of my signed message you will get the following error.   gpg: Signature made Fri 10 Jan 2014 09:39:34 PM UTC using RSA key ID A0F359F2gpg: BAD signature from ""Jolly Roger (They would live and die under it)""        So when should you sign a message? And when should you not sign a message? Great question. The majority of users should probably not sign messages unless they have to because it gives you plausible deniability. It is easier to deny posting certain things or certain communications you may have had with vendors or other people including law enforcement if you do not sign your messages, because you can always claim somebody else gained access to your account. It is harder to do this if you signed the message with your PGP private key. If you are dealing with somebody who wants to verify your identity and make sure that your current signature matches the public key they had on file for you from 6 months ago, then maybe they might get you to send a signed message. But again, all they really need to do is send you an encrypted message with your PGP public key they had on file, and if you cannot decrypt it, you are not who you say you are.      In real world application, developers can use PGP signed messages in News Announcements or perhaps new releases of their programs providing a download URL so that users can be sure the developer is the one posting the URL and not some malicious attacker who compromised the forum account of the developer and so forth. So for the average Silk Road forum user there really is not a lot of times when you should be signing messages unless you are a moderator or making a public announcement and so forth, but it is an option you now have in your arsenal, and now you can start verifying the signatures of the Administrators and Moderators in case you believe their accounts may have been compromised.","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA512Silk Road has not been compromised even if the allegations are true.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:04:36","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," By now if you have been following this thread, you should know that any type of messaging system is likely compromised or storing your data for an unknown period of time, and if you ever become a person of interest can be looked back upon for 5+ years.     This means things like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, Skype Messaging, Facebook Instant/Private Message, Text Messages, and other forms of communication are all likely being monitored to some degree, at the very least logging the meta data. But you should always treat everything as if those who are monitoring it can read the content of the email as well.      We have talked about communicating with PGP, we have talked about using TOR and hidden services, and we have talked about good practices of OpSec. But some of us want to be able to instant message somebody else. The good news is, you can do this with something called  TorChat.     TorChat is a decentralized anonymous instant messenger that uses Tor hidden services as its underlying Network, in other words it communicates over the Tor network through the .onion URL protocol. This provides  end to end encryption that we talked about in previous posts. It provides cryptographically secure text messaging and file transfers for business dealings, and confidential communication between two people. The best news, is that you can use TorChat on your Windows, Linux and your smart phones. A French developer released a version for MAC users, but it still in beta and should be used at your own risk. You can get TorChat for the iPhone in the Apple store, you can get TorChat in the Android Market as well, so you can even use it as a means of text messaging somebody else who also has TorChat.     In TorChat, every user has a unique alphanumeric ID consisting of 16 characters. This ID will be randomly created by Tor when the client is started the first time, it is basically the .onion address of a hidden service. TorChat clients communicate with each other by using Tor to contact the other's hidden service. For example, the first time you open TorChat your computer might generate  d0dj309jfj94jfgf.onion and from here on out,  d0dj309jfj94jfgf will be your TorChat ID that you give out to people that you want to be able to message you. Here is the home page of TorChat.   https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat  http://www.sourcemac.com/?page=torchat - MAC users     Unfortunately at this time, TorChat does not run properly in Tails, so you will either need to run it on your Windows, Linux or MAC system. It is pretty straight forward, download it, unpack it and run it and everything else should happen automatically for you. Once the avatar beside your TorChat ID turns green, you are online and same with your contacts. You can add contains by right clicking and choosing Add Contact and just enter their TorChat ID.     At this time there is some people debate as to whether or not TorChat is completely safe, and I would say that TorChat is about as safe as Tor is, just make sure you practice the same good practices you are used to. Do not give out personal information, if you are sending sensitive information use PGP encryption and so forth.     Here is another article on how TorChat works going into a little bit more detail. You can access it over the onion network.   http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Hacking_TorChat   UPDATE Another user had some additional input that I overlooked when writing this post that you should be aware of.  ","Torchat's security is unknown. It has not undergone a proper security audit, professional or otherwise, that I know of. It creates a hidden service on your computer leaving you vulnerable to deanonymization attacks that apply to all hidden services. It also seems to be a very basic protocol that looks like netcat over Tor. There is no way to decline a file transfer. It automatically starts the transfer, writing the file to /tmp which is a RAM-mounted tmpfs on Linux. Then you are supposed to save the file somewhere. Theoretically an attacker could transfer /dev/urandom while you are away from your computer until it fills up your RAM and crashes your computer. This would be great for inducing intersection attacks. Not sure though. If the kernel is managing the system correctly, it may just stop the transfer when you run out of RAM.Another thing is that once someone learns your Torchat ID there is no way to prevent them from knowing you are online, even if you remove them from your buddy list. The reason is because your Torchat instance is a hidden service that publishes a normal hidden service descriptor which anyone can download. There's no way to stop that. If you want to cut off contact with someone, you have to get a new Torchat ID. So you should be very conservative about handing out your Torchat ID and only give it to extremely trusted associates."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:06:22","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Some of you may have seen links to different websites on these forums. In fact my thread is full of them.      As you probably know by now, a hidden service is a website that uses a .onion address and a clearnet site uses the regular internet. You must be on TOR to access the onion network, whereas clearnet sites can be accessed from any browser. So why should you be careful when visiting clearnet sites?     When you see an article, link or video posted on the Silk Road forums, please note, that you should only be viewing those videos over TOR or possibly but as a last resort use a VPN and here is why. Let us use YouTube for example. YouTube is owned by Google, Google tracks  everything. YouTube keeps track of which IP addresses search for what videos, and tons of meta data about it's users.      When a link to a YouTube video is posted on the SR forums, we likely have to use our regular browsers to watch it because Tor browser is not good for watching flash videos. But the problem is, if a post on SR was written on January 10, 2014 recommending a video, and this video only has 500 views, perhaps this video has been up for a few months and did not end up being very popular. And then within the few days that this article was posted, 50 people viewing the Silk Road forum watch this video. The number of views just went up in a short period of time.      It is pretty easy to correlate that it is possible, that the people who watched that YouTube video, especially since it is not a popular video came from Silk Road, and if you made the mistake of using your real IP address, you have now been added to a list of people of interest. And if you do this multiple times with different YouTube videos, then they start to see a pattern and before you know it, they are confident that you are coming to watch these videos from Silk Road because every time a video is posted on Silk Road forums, your IP address comes up to watch this video.     But if you use a VPN, this makes things a little harder in that they are not as easily going to be able to link the video to you yet. But once they see a VPN address constantly popping up on those videos being linked from the forums, they might submit a court order to monitor the activities of the users of the VPN. HideMyAss was one of the most well known examples of VPNs being ordered to hand over information on their users.      The same thing goes with all clearnet sites. You never know who is monitoring their activity, and if it is an old article, more than a couple of years, then you can almost bet that the number of people viewing that article are down. So when somebody posts a clearnet link on the forums and people visit that link using an unprotected IP address, then the LE can start to correlate patterns against you. Of course, these articles and links are not as likely to be visited without TOR from the SR forums because you need TOR to view the forums, but especially things like YouTube videos since TOR does not work well with YouTube can be problematic.      So what can you do to protect yourself? Ask yourself first, do I really need to watch that YouTube video? Is it something important that I need to see? If it is, you might consider an option that I spoke about earlier called Tortilla, but it is only available to Windows users. I talk it about it at the following article.  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=14555.msg304569#msg304569     You will run a Virtual Machine such as Debian, but do not connect to TOR using the Virtual Machine. The VM uses a bridged apapter and routes all traffic through Tortilla which routes all traffic through TOR on your Windows host OS without having to use the TOR browser on your VM. MAC users and Linux users may just want to view the YouTube video in a one time use proxy that does not keep any logs or maybe a public wifi network that has lots of users on it daily.      There is an infamous case of a murderer who called the sister of his victim from his victim's cell phone. He would call from her Time Square in New York and taunt her and talk about how she was torturing her sister and the police put a trace on the phone. Unfortunately because Time Square is such a crowded place, even with all the cameras, they were unable to pinpoint exactly which person was making the call on that phone and they never ended up catching the guy. He ended up ditching the phone after he finally killed his victim. They knew he was a guy walking around Time Square on a cell phone but if you have ever been to Time Square, you know that there are millions of people doing the exact same thing, he just blended right in.     So you may want to use a public wifi in a crowded area that has many users all day long to watch a video and keep your IP address safe. If you cannot watch videos safely without identifying yourself, then do not watch them. It is as simple as this. Yes I know it is annoying that Tor does not work well with flash videos, but it is better than being thrown in jail where you will never be able to watch any YouTube videos.      The main reason I wrote this post was to remind you that correlating two users together on the internet is easier than you think. Once you start developing patterns and leaving your footprints behind, the LE have an unlimited storage space available to them to keep track of everything you do. Remember how Sabu got caught? He just logged onto IRC with his real IP address,  one time. One time is all it takes for them to take you down. Always think before opening a link, what will this website identify about me? ",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:07:56","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," First thing I want you to do is find a secure way of watching this video. Remember they log everyone who watches these videos and since I am linking you to them from Silk Road, they will be watched even closer.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x74iq0_compromising-electromagnetic-emanat_tech     This video shows how using a strong antenna, sitting in a van outside your home, the FBI could be picking up on your keystrokes on a  wired keyboard. In fact many people speculate that the new smart meters installed in many homes already have this technology to determine everything you are doing in your home electronically. Wired and wireless keyboards emit electromagnetic waves, because they contain electronic components. This electromagnetic radiation could reveal sensitive information such as keystrokes as shown in the video. Every electrmagnetic wave is unique to the device using it, which gives a person spying on you the ability to tell the difference between you using your computer versus the dishwasher.  According to the people who did this experiment, they were able to extend the range up to 20 meters using relatively cheap technology. This was for wired keyboards by the way, and they go on to explain that wireless keyboards and mouses are even easier. Which brings us to another area of interest, wireless transmissions. Things like wireless keyboards and wireless mice (or mouses?) are vulnerable to eavesdropping as well. If they are not using a strong enough encryption to send data to the receiver, anyone can be listening in on your keystrokes and mouse activity. Probably something most people never thought about either, this is on top of the electromagnetic waves that can also be picked up.      Are you using wireless technology? How old is it? Might be time to upgrade your equipment. 10 meters is about 33 feet, but remember the technology available to the government could potentially reach beyond that. Then there are other things people forget such as wireless monitors which broadcast your screen to a receiver that can be picked up. Just think about the old antennas people used to have on top of their homes, and how far away those could pick up signals from TV stations, if you had one of those pointed at you in a van across the street, there is no doubt they could be eavesdropping on your activities inside.      One researcher was able to use a wireless signal sent by a smart meter from up to 300 meters away (900 feet) to find out which house it was coming from and what the current power consumption was in plain text. She was then able to use this information to determine when people were and were not home based on average spikes in consumption since the meters pulse every 30 seconds.       Things like automatic timers that flip switches might be worth investing in to always make it look like someone is home until security researchers start looking into ways to avoid the wide open door we are giving to anyone who wants to find data about us.      What can you do about these types of eavesdropping? Not a whole lot unless you want to start turning into a tin-foil hat type of person. There are some fun things you can do if you want to go crazy with it though as recommended by the following site.  http://www.lessemf.com/smart.html      There are lots of other things on there as well like drapes, curtains, garments, fabrics and so forth which disrupt the tranmission of these signals. It is completely up to you what you want to do, I am just giving you the options and the education so you can make an educated decision of how far you want to go to protect your privacy. ","Microsoft has upgraded the weak encryption found on todays mass-market wireless keyboards with a new design that uses 128-bit AES to secure communication to and from the PC.Hitherto, keyboard encryption has been weak, with keys chosen from a small palette of possibilities, with one hacking group claiming in 2009 that it had developed a tool specifically to sniff keystrokes from Microsoft keyboards at a range up to a 10 metres.http://news.techworld.com/security/3284218/new-microsoft-wireless-keyboard-gets-128-bit-encryption/;The data sent was in plain text and carried the identification number of the meter and its reading.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:09:58","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Here are a few recommendations that may slip by the average user on these forums.  1.  Never leave your computer that you use for your freedom fighting unattended. This may seem like a no-brainer, but if you have kids, or a spouse or a sibling that does not understand what you do on the computer and they decide to hop on your account and sign into their email, Facebook or doing things that could compromise your location while on that computer because they simply did not know, this could potentially cause you problems.      Maybe you are connecting through multiple layers like this TOR -> VPN(1) -> TOR -> VPN(2), so that is 4 layers and VPN(2) is the IP address that everyone sees. Then your child or spouse goes on to their email with that IP address, then signs off without your knowledge. That VPN is now linked to you. And we remember how when under pressure, companies will likely give out information about their customers to avoid fines, shut downs and prosecution.  2.  Do not tell your family members what you are doing, just instruct them not to touch your computer. Keep it passworded. - You should never tell anyone what you are doing on your computer because if law enforcement ever did show up, they would question your family and friends about you. If they honestly do not know, then they cannot be held in contempt of court, so it is better to keep them in the dark. Or maybe the police might scare them into giving up all your secrets because they tell your family that if they do not confess that yourself and them will be going to jail, possibly for a long time. Just password your computer and never leave it unattended with the screen unlocked.   3.  If you use multiple layers to connect, make sure you regularly check to make sure all your layers are in tact. VPNs can drop sometimes without warning and while you should never set yourself up so that if one layer drops you lose everything, just keep in mind when one drops that you may need to adjust the way you handle yourself online until you get that next layer up. This is one of the reaons I like Tortilla so much, if my TOR layer does not work, it does not bypass it and go to my next layer, instead it just stops working altogether. When VPNs drop, your computer bypasses the dropped VPN and moves onto the next layer, which in some cases could be your real IP address. Just something to keep in mind.   4.  Do not use the same password for multiple forums, marketplaces, emails and so forth. - Expect that one or more of the websites you are registered with is storing your password in plain text. This means that if somebody finds an exploit in the software and is able to dump the entire database, they can find your password. And if you used the same password for other sites, and god forbid with the same username as well, your entire list of accounts is compromised. Always use different passwords and keep them strong. Do not let anything about your password identify how you choose passwords, or identify anything personal about you. ",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:11:09","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," This post is meant to serve as an example of how, when cryptography and anonymity is used properly, you can evade just about anybody including the police.     By now, everyone has likely heard of someone getting locked out of their computer and being forced to pay by the attacker to have it unlocked, this is CryptoLocker. Dell SecureWorks estimates that CryptoLocker has infected 250,000 victims. The average payout is $300 each, and millions in laundered Bitcoin have been tracked and traced to the ransomware's money runners.     CryptoLocker is a ransomware trojan which targets computers running Microsoft Windows[1] and first surfaced in September 2013. A CryptoLocker attack may come from various sources; one such is disguised as a legitimate email attachment. A ZIP file attached to an email message contains an executable file with the filename and the icon disguised as a PDF file, taking advantage of Windows' default behaviour of hiding the extension from file names to disguise the real .EXE extension. When activated, the malware encrypts certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography to generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers.      The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either Bitcoin or a pre-paid voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatens to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offers to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin.     Dell SecureWorks estimates that CryptoLocker has infected 250,000 victims. The average payout is $300 each, and millions in laundered Bitcoin have been tracked and traced to the ransomware's money runners. In November 2013, the operators of CryptoLocker launched an online service which claims to allow users to decrypt their files without the CryptoLocker program, and to purchase the decryption key after the deadline expires; the process involves uploading an encrypted file to the site as a sample, and waiting for the service to find a match, which the site claims would occur within 24 hours. Once a match is found, the user can pay for the key online; if the 72-hour deadline has passed, the cost increases to 10 Bitcoin.     To date, no one has successfully defeated CryptoLocker. The Swansea, Massachusetts police department was hit in November. The officers paid CryptoLocker's ransom. Police Lt. Gregory Ryan told press that his department shelled out around $750 for two Bitcoin on November 10. One of the reasons I am posting this, is that CryptoLocker uses 2,048 RSA encryption, and if you remember in the PGP posts earlier in this thread I recommended to use 4096. Even with 2,048 bit encryption, no one has successfully defeated CryptoLocker, and this is the power of properly implemented cryptography.     And, using the proper methods of anonymity, this person or group has managed to acquire, according to research done by ZDNet, around 41,928 BTC.  http://www.zdnet.com/cryptolockers-crimewave-a-trail-of-millions-in-laundered-bitcoin-7000024579/      As you can see, properly executed cryptography and anonymity allowed this group of people acquire the Bitcoin equivalent of almost $42 million in just now 4 months at the time of this post. I am not recommending or advocating that you do this, but just giving you a perfect example of how powerful the combination of these two very important factors are in protecting anybody online when used properly. ","In research for this article ZDnet traced four bitcoin addresses posted (and re-posted) in forums by multiple CryptoLocker victims, showing movement of 41,928 BTC between October 15 and December 18.Based on the current Bitcoin value of $661, the malware ninjas have moved $27,780,000 through those four addresses alone - if CryptoLocker cashes out today.If CryptoLocker's supervillans cash out when Bitcoin soars back up to $1000, like it did on November 27... Well, $41.9 million isn't bad for three months of work."

This new one is directed at vendors, but it nonetheless should serve as an example of the type of scams that people are going to be trying to pull on members of this forum and other forums.      The user who sent out this message actually used the name  Dread Pirates Robert, which is similar but not correct.

I remember when a moderator named  Sarge was in charge of vendor bonds, there was a user with the name Sarrge (two r's) that was trying to scam vendors into sending their bonds to his address instead and unfortunately, several people fell for this scam.     Please always check if there is a PGP signature, and if there is not, kindly ask the Administrator or Moderator to resend the message to you using a signature.

Since we can't just stop operation of the site completely, we are forced to develop a way for only some of the vendors to go into a temporary vacation mode. In need of recent server upgrades, as well as this new method we are implementing, it has occured to us that the only way to pick which vendors are going to remain in business is by how much sales/profit they are doing, as well as how much being a vendor on our site means to them. Here's how this is going to work:If you would like to keep vending on the site during our upgrades/repairs, we are going to require that you pay an additional .3BTC bond to us. If you pay this .3BTC bond, your account will remain active and you will keep vending while we work to fix the problems. If you do not pay this .3BTC bond, your account will be temporarily put into vacation mode status and you will be unable to vend until we locate and remedy the problem. We are very sorry for these changes!In the event you do pay the bond, as soon as the vending opens back up to everyone, you will have your .3BTC bond returned, and you will receive a premium vendor account status. You will have a title on your page that displays you as ""Hardcore Vendor"". We are terribly sorry we have to ask this of all our hardworking vendors, but there is really no other way for us to decide WHO gets to keep vending and who has to wait until we fix things.Our team is working hard at the problem, and we estimate it will be no longer than a week for the changes to be made and vending to open back up to everyone.Vendors who will pay bond: Please send .3BTC to BTC Address: 1NbEs2rJgreRUvjp9o7hUWo3akeLA3EfFYVendors who are unable to pay bond: Your accounts will go into vacation mode at 12:01AM UTC February 2nd.Let us never forget this recent hurdle in our battle for freedom.

In the case of this student, he was likely the only student at Harvard using tor at the moment this email was sent, and when the authorities came to his dorm he quickly admitted he was responsible.      He likely never would have been caught, but remember when you use tor, others can be aware that you are using it. A better idea for him would have been to connect to another computer remotely and have that computer connected to tor to send the email. This way, they never could have seen his computer connected to tor. I would not worry about using tor on a regular basis from your home, because there are hundreds of thousands of tor users, but it is again, something to be aware of. tor will not cover your bad OpSec mistakes like in the case of Eldo Kim. ","...the student took steps to disguise his identity by using Tor, a software which allows users to browse the web anonymously, and Guerrilla Mail, a service which allows users to create free, temporary email addresses.Despite 20-year-old Eldo Kims goal of anonymity, his attempts to mask his identity led authorities right to his front door. Does that mean that Tor failed a user looking to delay his Politics of American Education exam? Not in the slightest.While the Harvard student did indeed use Tor, it was his other sloppy security measures that led to his arrest. The complaint says the university was able to determine that, in the several hours leading up to the receipt of the e-mail messages  Eldo Kim accessed Tor using Harvards wireless network.What Kim didnt realize is that Tor, which masks online activity, doesnt hide the fact that you are using the software. In analyzing the headers of the emails sent through the Guerrilla Mail account, authorities were able to determine that the anonymous sender was connected to the anonymity network.Using that conclusion, they then attempted to discern which students had been using Tor on the Harvard wireless network around the time of the threats. Before firing up Tor, Kim had to log on to the schools wireless system, which requires users to authenticate with a username and password. By going through network logs and looking for users who connected to the publicly-known IP addresses that are part of the Tor network, the university was able to cross-reference users that were using both Tor and its wireless internet around the time the bomb threats were received."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:15:15","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," I have a few stories to share from people who used LocalBitCoins to sell their Bitcoins.       This guy, likely a BTC miner, was arrested and questioned by police for selling BTC to a buyer over several transactions. They must have assumed that the buyer was using fraudulent funds and this shifted suspicion onto the seller as well. I do not know if this story is true, but I am tending to believe it is. Police are monitoring these transactions, so you better make sure you have a reasonable explanation as to where you obtained the Bitcoins you are trying to sell.      This next story was removed by the original poster (OP), but luckily somebody in the replies quoted the entire post and therefore I was able to grab it.      This story above, I do not know if it is true either, but it is something to think about. According to the OP, law enforcement wanted all his messages and phone numbers, obviously to try and find other people involved in money laundering and the drug trade. He was scared enough to have deleted the original post, but as I mentioned, some other people quoted it and I was able to grab it.     To summarize, the police are likely watching these Bitcoin transactions to some degree and you need to establish a buyer or seller that you can trust. Once you find a good one, stick with them, even if their rates go up. Try to search for people with established feedback, ask for ID if you want, and make sure you have nothing incriminating on you, or at your home around the time of these transactions. You never know when you could be trying to offload your BTC to a cop!","In September and October, I sold 213 BTC (gradually) to some random guy on localbitcoins. Everything went fine, each time I got the money, I sent the bitcoins. 5 days after the last transaction, I get arrested by the police. ""Where does this money come from?"" I explain about bitcoins, and tell them all I know about the random guy, I volunteer my phone to analyse my emails and check my story. Once they were sure that the guy contacted me and not the other way around, I was finally free to go. Later they told me that the money was stolen and they thought I was doing money laundering.Now after almost 3 months and a lot of back and forth with the police, they are now suggesting that I send back the money. I would gladly do that if they arrested the criminal and found out he can not repay. Right now if I send back the money, the innocent person who got his money stolen gets it back, but then I become the innocent person who got his money stolen, so that makes no sense to me.Edit: I just saw a lawyer. According to him I already won the case. But it's going to cost me some serious money in lawyer's fees... More than my cumulated profits. I take that as the cost of a great life lesson and a wake-up call.He also told me I can disclose the info that the police already knows. So here we go. I'm in Brisbane, Australia. The reason the police froze my account and not the criminal's account is that they wanted to know where the money was going. The police are regularly checking my house to make sure the criminal is not seeking revenge (he has my full address and I have 2 kids).http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1to08d/arrested_by_the_police_for_localbitcoins_business/;So, as a few of you guys know, I'm moving to another country soon enough. When I get over there I won't have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didn't have all my paperwork on my car in order,  so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably should've been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didn't come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasn't) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasn't selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isn't valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldn't prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).They then told me that if I didn't give them all the messages & phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them ""analyzed"". I was about to move country in the next few days and didn't want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (I'm obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though we're not breaking the law it doesn't mean you won't get unwanted attention from the police.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=174918.msg1820363#msg1820363"

A phishing scam is when somebody sends you to a URL that looks like the real URL, but it is actually set up so that when you login, it steals your login credentials and the attacker takes over your account.

Everything looked great at first as we signed up, got verified and then proceeded to transact with the trader. We sent our Bitcoins and where confronted with some windows which began to confuse our tester, who mistakenly confirmed the transaction, minutes after sending the Bitcoins. Our tester was not sure if they needed to click the confirmation to advise the trader that the coins where sent, so spent some time in the FAQ to find out what to do next. No information was found by our tester, who then guessed that since there was no mention of it, then it must be a trivial issue and confirmed the transaction anyway. What happened next worried out tester as the transaction was marked as closed and they had sent the Bitcoins to the trader without knowing if the fiat money would be deposited into the bank account. We waited 24 hours to confirm a cash transaction into a designated account and lo and behold, its not there.Next we proceeded to contact the trader and as of writing, we have not heard from them. We contacted Localbitcoin support and began a ticket. Shortly afterwards, we received an email from Localbitcoin support staff and explained the situation and where told that the confirmation did need to be done AFTER we confirmed the funds had been placed into our designated account by the trader.After a few emails to the support staff, we did explain that we where testing the system useability for the everyday mom and pop situation, because if Bitcoin is to be used properly, it needs to have an easy (dumbed down) system so the inexperienced user can make a trade without making mistakes like our tester did.http://mentaso.com/bitcoin-news/item/224-localbitcoins-scammed-on-our-first-test-of-the-system.html;User requested nearly $2k CAD worth of bitcoins using my localbitcoins ad.Immediately asked to move the conversation to text messaging, asked me how many coins I have in there (localbitcoins wallet) then (after some dawdling and chitchat) asked me to check out and read his other localbitcoins ad first.Included was a URL to localbitcoinis.com with an ad url long enough I know this was copy/pasted and not a typo.A quick WHOIS reveals a domain by proxy, but some google-fu on the contact telephone number registered to the domain reveals that domains related to this phone number have been involved in other scams.http://bitcoinviews.com/scam-alert-localbitcoinis-com-scammer-contacting-localbitcoins-com-users/"
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:18:49","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," This post is going to talk about something that has been commonly discussed on the forums recently. How can I hide my tor usage from my ISP ?     People are more worried about hiding their tor usage from their ISP, than hiding it from a VPN. There seems to be a back and forth debate about whether using a VPN will or will not protect you. Whether or not the VPN can be convinced to log  your connection, and so forth. A few of my previous posts regarding LulzSec and the YardBird pedophile rings have shown that those who rely on VPNs to protect them are historically known to end up in jail. Even our friend we were recently introduced to, The Grugq says, TOR -> VPN is ok, but VPN -> TOR, go to jail.      In my previous posts about VPN -> TOR and TOR -> VPN, I tried to remain neutral in that you should be able to make your own decisions about how you wish to protect yourself. But just remember, at the end of the day, nobody is going to go to jail for you. If you simply want to hide the fact that you are using tor from your ISP, then we have other options than a VPN. We have bridges, and several different pluggable transports. What are these, and how can we use them in Tails?      The first thing we are going to do is get some bridges. Let us do this before we configure Tails to use bridges, because once Tails is in bridge mode, we will not be able to connect to tor without working bridges. So the first thing we want to do is visit the following webpage.  https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges     Enter the impossibly difficult captcha, and click ""I am human"", and you should get a list of bridges that look like this. These are actual bridges pulled from the tor bridges page.      These bridges are publicly available on the Tor Project website, so they may or not may be the best choice to use, but they are a good start. Another option is to send an email to  bridges@bridges.torproject.org with a message in the body saying ""get bridges"" without the quotes. This will only work if sent from a Gmail account or Yahoo, unfortunately. If you want to use this, set up the email account using tor and you will receive a list of around 3 bridges shortly thereafter.  Save them somewhere you can use them the next time you boot up Tails, or write them down.        Ok, so now we have our bridges. How do we use bridges in Tails? This is an option we need to activate when we boot up Tails. To activate the bridge mode, we will be adding the  bridge boot option to the boot menu. The boot menu is the first screen to appear when Tails starts. It is the black screen that says Boot Tails and gives you two options. 1. Live, 2. Live (Fail Safe). When you are on this screen, press Tab and a list of boot options will appear in the form of text at the bottom of the screen. To add a new boot option, add a Space then type ""bridge"" without the quotes and press enter. You have now activated bridge mode.     Once Tails boots up completely, you will get a warning that you have entered bridge mode and not to delete the default IP address in there, which is 127.0.0.1:*. This is advice we will follow, so just click OK and the settings window for tor will pop up. At this point you need to add your bridges. So you are going to take the three bridges you got, and enter the IP address and the port. If we were going to use the example above this is what we would enter.      For each bridge you add, type it in the available text box where it says ""Add A Bridge"" and then click the green + button to add that bridge. You will need to add one bridge at a time. Once you are finished adding your bridges, you can click OK. At this point, your yellow tor onion icon in the top right should turn green shortly after and you will be connected to the tor network using a bridge. Again, since these bridges are less likely to be known by your ISP, they are less likely to know that you are using tor when you use bridges.      You may wish to look up your bridge before you use it however. Maybe you want to find out where your bridge is located, maybe you want to see who is hosting the bridge, and you can do this by looking for a IP look up service online, by doing a search and typing in the IP address. The three listed above are located in the following locations.      And with that, you can decide which bridge would be a better choice for you to use. I suggest however, that you go and get new bridges and do not use the ones I listed above for obvious reasons that they are now linked to Silk Road users by me posting them on this forum. I should note that the way bridges hide the fact that you are using tor from your ISP, is that you are connected to an IP address that is likely not known to your ISP to be affiliated with tor entry nodes.      While bridges are a good idea, unfortunately they may not be enough. According to Jacob Applebaum, (a tor developer) bridge traffic is still vulnerable to something called DPI (deep packet inspection) to identify internet traffic flows by protocol, in other words they can tell you are using tor by analyzing the traffic. While tor uses bridge relays to get around a censor that blocks by IP address, the censor can use DPI to recognize and filter tor traffic flows even when they connect to unexpected IP addresses. This is less likely to be done by your ISP, and more likely to be done by the NSA, or other oppresive governments like in China and Iran, so you can choose if this is an issue for you.      Pluggable transports are a more new, but less talked about technology being implemented by tor to disguise the fact that you are using tor to your ISP and other censors. As mentioned above, it attempts to transform your tor traffic into innocent looking traffic that would hopefully be indistinguishable from normal web browsing traffic. Currently the most popular pluggable transports are obfuscated bridges. Obfuscation by definition, is the hiding of the intended meaning in communication, making communication confusing, wilfully ambiguous, and harder to interpret. Obfuscated bridges actually transform the traffic to look like random packets of data. Obfuscated bridges currently have 2 protocols.    1. obfs22. obfs3     Obfs2 (The Twobfuscator) is talked about at length at the following official page.  https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs2/obfs2-protocol-spec.txt     But for the laymans out there, basically obfs2 uses a protocol that disguises your traffic to look like random data, whereas tor has a more distinct structure to it. However, it should be noted in the case of obfs2, that if an attacker sniffs the initial handshake between your computer and the obfuscated bridge, they could get the encryption key used to disguise your traffic and use it to decrypt the disguised traffic which would reveal it as tor traffic. They would not be able to decrypt your tor traffic, but they would be able to see you are using tor. This is not likely something your ISP would do, but it may be something law enforcement or the NSA would do. So if you are only worried about your ISP, then obfs2 would likely suffice.     Obfs3 (The Threebfuscator) is talked about at length at the following official page.  https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt     Obfs3 uses a very similar protocol to disguise your traffic as obfs2, however it uses a more advanced method of an initial handshake called the Diffie Hellman key exchange. They however found some vulnerabilities in the protocol and had to go a step further and customize the Diffie Hellman key exchange to make it an even more robust method of establishing that initial handshake. Using obfs3 would be a better bet to disguise your traffic if your adversary is the NSA or other law enforcement.      So how do you get these obfuscated bridges? They are not as easy to get, but they can be obtained from tor through email. However, you need to request those bridges specifically to get them. You need to use a Gmail or Yahoo account and send an email to bridges@bridges.torproject.org and enter in the body of the email ""transport obfs2"" without the quotes, and for obfs3, simply enter ""transport obfs3"". Please note that you can only send one request to tor per email, every 3 hours. Which one you should use, is entirely your choice, I am just giving you the information necessary to make an informed choice. Enter them in this format so that Tails knows which protocol to use.     obfs3 83.212.101.2:42782    obfs2 70.182.182.109:54542     tor also provides a few obfuscated bridges on their home page which you can use as well, and I will list them below. If you send a request to tor and get a response containing bridges without obfs2 or obsf3 at the beginning of the lines, then these are normal bridges, not obfuscated, and they are likely to be out of obfuscated bridges at the moment. You will have to try again another day. So if you get a response with bridges that are without obfs2 or 3 at the beginning of each line, please again, be aware these are normal bridges, unlike the ones below.     obfs3 83.212.101.2:42782    obfs3 83.212.101.2:443    obfs3 169.229.59.74:31493    obfs3 169.229.59.75:46328    obfs3 209.141.36.236:45496    obfs3 208.79.90.242:35658    obfs3 109.105.109.163:38980    obfs3 109.105.109.163:47779    obfs2 83.212.100.216:47870    obfs2 83.212.96.182:46602    obfs2 70.182.182.109:54542    obfs2 128.31.0.34:1051    obfs2 83.212.101.2:45235        I have a feeling that some of you reading this will be inclined to go out and get yourself some obfs3 bridges right away, because you think they are the best choice out there for staying anonymous. And right now they have the potential of being what you hope for in that regard, except for one huge flaw. The number of obfs3 bridges is small. Last report I read put it at around 40 bridges running obfs3, and obfs2 was around 200. So while obfs3 is the most secure option out there, its limited number of available bridges would pool you into a smaller group of people making connections to the 40 available bridges and may not provide any more anonymity for you. tor is in depserate need of more obfs2 and obfs3 bridges at this time and these factors should be taken into account when using obfuscated bridges.     One of the solutions to this shortage problem, is to run your own obfuscated bridge. I am not going to go into it, but if you are interested in doing this, you should visit the following page to set up an obfuscated proxy, or better yet, purchase a few VPS and set them up as obfs2 or obfs3 proxies. One of the best things about doing it this way, is that you can configure it (with the instructions provided) to be a private obfuscated bridge, and therefore tor will not give it out to the public. You can then connect to your own private obfs3 bridge. You can also use a friend's computer, or use a server that you know is secure. But again, make sure that you trust the computer you are using, otherwise it is no more secure than a VPN.      Another possible solution to the lack of obfuscated bridges may be another pluggable transport option, something called a  flash proxy. This is brand new and not perfectly implemented yet, and please be aware that this is basically still in beta. When thinking about a flash proxy, think about the characteristics of a flash,  quick and short lived. This protocol was developed by a tor developer who attended Stanford University, and the idea is that the IP addresses used are changed faster than a censoring agency can detect, track, and block them. This method is similar to using normal bridges, in that, it hides the fact you are connecting to IP addresses known to be related to tor, including when the bridge's IP addresses listed by tor are discovered by your ISP or law enforcement.  This does not however, hide the fact you are using tor if somebody is analyzing your traffic using DPI (deep packet inspection).  ","What bridges are and when to use themWhen using Tor with Tails in its default configuration, anyone who can observe the traffic of your Internet connection (for example your Internet Service Provider and perhaps your government and law enforcement agencies) can know that you are using Tor.This may be an issue if you are in a country where the following applies:    1. Using Tor is blocked by censorship: since all connections to the Internet are forced to go through Tor, this would render Tails useless for everything except for working offline on documents, etc.    2. Using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious: in this case starting Tails in its default configuration might get you into serious trouble.Tor bridges, also called Tor bridge relays, are alternative entry points to the Tor network that are not all listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for your Internet Service Provider to know that you are using Tor.https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode/index.en.html;  5.20.130.121:9001 63dd98cd106a95f707efe538e98e7a6f92d28f94  106.186.19.58:443 649027f9ea9a8e115787425430460386e14e0ffa  69.125.172.116:443 43c3a8e5594d8e62799e96dc137d695ae4bd24b2;  5.20.130.121:9001  106.186.19.58:443  69.125.172.116:443;5.20.130.121 - Country:   Lithuania106.186.19.58:443 - Country: Japan69.125.172.116:443 - Country: New Jersey, United States; Lately, censors have found ways to block Tor even when clients are using bridges. They usually do this by installing boxes in ISPs that peek at network traffic and detect Tor; when Tor is detected they block the traffic flow.To circumvent such sophisicated censorship Tor introduced obfuscated bridges. These bridges use special plugins called pluggable transports which obfuscate the traffic flow of Tor, making its detection harder.https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports"

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:21:36","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security","  Note: as of now, electrum is included in TAILS, no need to setup anything. This is obsolete and insecure as the download is not checked - I did copy it anyway for your information but you'd rather use the electrum client that comes with TAILS.  In this post I want to talk about 2 options for trading your Bitcoins.  #1 - Blockchain #2 - Electrum     By now, hopefully you know how to use BlockChain. If not, you simply go to http://blockchain.info and press the button ""Wallet"" and you can open up your existing wallet or create a new account. Very straight forward and can be done all from your web browser.      But what about Electrum? Electrum is an easy to use Bitcoin client. It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart. There is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain. If you use the normal Bitcoin client from https://bitcoin.org then you would need to download the entire blockchain, which is several GB of data. In Tails, we are trying not to download too much to our computers. Downloading the entire BlockChain can take over 24 hours.     So how do we set up Electrum in Tails? First thing we need to do is download it.   https://download.electrum.org/Electrum-1.9.7.tar.gz     Now extract it (right click -> Extract here) and rename the folder to electrum to make things easier. (Right click -> Rename). You might also want to move the folder to the  tmp directory so it is easier to find. (Places -> Computer -> File System -> tmp)      Next open up a terminal and type the following command   cd /tmp/electrum      You can replace /tmp/electrum with whatever directory electrum is currently in, but this is why we put it in tmp, to make things easier for us. Next type the following command.   ./electrum -s 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost:9050     This will allow your electrum to connect through Tor, to make sure it does not connect over clearnet. You will get a warning when you do this that electrum is attempting to connect in an unsafe manner, but this is expected, and do not worry, it is safe to do this. This step was recommended on the Tails web page at the following URL.   https://tails.boum.org/forum/Report:_the_electrum_bitcoin_client_in_tails/  Since you are likely going to want to reuse your wallet that is generated in Electrum, you can specify where your wallet is kept by replacing the above command with the following command.   ./electrum -s 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost:9050 -w /tmp/electrum.dat     You would replace /tmp/electrum.dat with whatever the path to your wallet is, and you can rename  electrum.dat to whatever you want to call your wallet, like  srwallet.dat or whatever you want. Or leave it the way that it is. Then each time you want to start up electrum, reuse the same command, and make sure you copy electrum.dat into  /tmp or whatever directory you wish to use. Then when you are finished, make sure to back up electrum.dat onto your USB drive or SD card, especially if you do not have Tails persistence. This way you can reuse the same wallet and you will not lose your balance.      Electrum is likely going to be the Bitcoin client of choice for Tails users.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:59:50","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security","  Here are some things to consider.    Read those pages directly as they have links to other articles on them as well.  Here is another little trick I know of. Never keep a password you can remember. You cannot give up a password you do not know. Perhaps you have a little piece of paper with your password on it that you swallow the second the cops come in. A long password that you could never remember.   Another thing you can say is, I wrote down my password on a piece of paper but the police must have destroyed the piece of paper when they raided my home. Check out the below quote from an article.   And in the case of whether or not you can be forced to give up a password is a matter of debate that has gone back and forth in court cases to date.   And what about the charges for failing to do so?   And in the US, since most people busted will be extradited there anyways, treats contempt in the following way.   Furthermore.   In regards to two cases in which defendants were not forced to give up their passwords   The analysis of why they were not forced to give them up is below.   But when law enforcment was able to provide proof of existing evidence on an encrypted drive, courts were much more likely to demand decryption, such as in the following cases.   And the analysis of the cases below.   1) It may be possible, to identify you as a Tails user, but it would take a lot of analysis to do so, and Tails is getting better at blending in with every update.   2) Think about what you could possibly be charged with, and think about whether or not it is more serious than a contempt charge. The longest sentence to date for contempt was 14 years, and this is almost unheard of. You are not likely to get this kind of charge against you, but if you do, would it be better than life in prison for whatever else you might be charged with?  Remember Sabu to LulzSec hacker? being charged with 112 years in prison for hacking? I think he would trade 14 years in prison for contempt over 112 years any day. I know I would.  3) Without the knowledge of incriminating evidence existing on your drives, you are less likely to be forced to decrypt your drives, and this even applies in child pornography cases as demonstrated above.   4) Maintain your right to remain silent, never keep anything on your computers that you do not have to.   5) Do not have a password you can remember. Or if you do, tell them you had it written down but it was misplaced or possibly damaged during the raid and you are unable to recall the password. Perhaps you are too traumatized from the even of having your face shoved into the floor to remember what happened during those 2 minutes?  Anyways, this is a lot of data to go through, so I will leave it at that and we can go from there. You just need to always follow best practices. Turn off your computer when you are not using it, encrypt everything, never tell anybody your passwords, never leave any evidence of the contents of your drives lying around (like notes or diary entries), and never admit having anything on your drives to anyone online, even under your pseudonym as that can be used against you in court.  Deny deny deny deny deny.  Hope this helps. ","Hi JR,For some reason I have seen a lot of information and discussion about privacy and anonymity but nothing at all about deniability, which to be honest concerns me that some people may think that because the NSA can't crack their password, everything is safe but people easily overestimate their ability to stand up to sanctions imposed by a court should the shit hit the fan...I was wondering about the deniability problems with using Tails (or any of the security measures really). You have to assume that if you get arrested and it goes to court, you will be compelled to give any of your passwords that they want. It's all well and good thinking that you won't give it to them, but when they sentence you to a $1000 a day or simply jail until you tell them you will probably tell them your passwords...With that in mind, is there any deniable way to use Tails (or at least deniable in some respects)? I used to run everything off a hidden volume in a Truecrypt memorystick (which is supposed to be impossible to prove exists), is there an equivalent with LUKS?Also, can your ISP or FBI differentiate between Tor and Tails through your internet usage?Thanks for your time;Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably TailsYour Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your local network administrator can see that you're connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server for example. Using Tor bridges in certain conditions can help you hide the fact that you are using Tor.The destination server that you are contacting through Tor can know whether your communication comes out from a Tor exit node by consulting the publicly available list of exit nodes that might contact it. For example using the Tor Bulk Exit List tool of the Tor Project.So using Tails doesn't make you look like any random Internet user. The anonymity provided by Tor and Tails works by trying to make all of their users look the same so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html#index2h1;In this context, the term fingerprint refers to what is specific to Tails in the way it behaves on Internet. This can be used to determine whether a particular user is using Tails or not.As explained on our warning page, when using Tails it is possible to know that you are using Tor. But Tails tries to make it as difficult as possible to distinguish Tails users from other Tor users, especially Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) users. If it is possible to determine whether your are a Tails users or a TBB user, this provides more information about you and in consequence reduces your anonymity.This section explains some issues regarding the fingerprint of Tails and how this could be used to identify you as a Tails user.For the websites that you are visitingThe websites that you are visiting can retrieve a lot of information about your browser. That information can include its name and version, window size, list of available extensions, timezone, available fonts, etc.To make it difficult to distinguish Tails users from TBB users, the Tor browser tries to provide the same information as the TBB in order to have similar fingerprints.See the fingerprint section of know issues page for a list of known differences between the fingerprints of the Tor browser and the TBB.Apart from that, some of the extensions included in Tor browser are different than the ones included in the TBB. More sophisticated attacks can use those differences to distinguish Tails user from TBB users.For example, Tails includes Adblock Plus which removes advertisements. If an attacker can determine that you are not downloading the advertisements that are included in a webpage, that could help identify you as a Tails user.For the moment, you should consider that no special care is taken regarding the fingerprint of the Unsafe Browser.For your ISP or local network administrator    Tor bridges are most of the time a good way of hiding the fact that you are connecting to Tor to a local observer. If this is important for you, read our documentation about bridge mode.    A Tails system is almost exclusively generating Tor activity on the network. Usually TBB users also have network activity outside of Tor, either from another web browser or other applications. So the proportion of Tor activity could be used to determine whether a user is using Tails or the TBB. If you are sharing your Internet connection with other users that are not using Tails it is probably harder for your ISP to determine whether a single user is generating only Tor traffic and so maybe using Tails.    Tails do not use the entry guards mechanism of Tor. With the entry guard mechanism, a Tor user always uses the same few relays as first hops. As Tails does not store any Tor information between separate working sessions, it does not store the entry guards information either. This behaviour could be used to distinguish Tails users from TBB users across several working sessions.    When starting, Tails synchronizes the system clock to make sure it is accurate. While doing this, if the time is set too much in the past or in the future, Tor is shut down and started again. This behavior could be used to distinguish Tails from TBB users, especially this happens every time Tails starts.https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/fingerprint/index.en.html;Dubois said that, in addition, his client may not be able to decrypt the laptop for any number of reasons. ""If that's the case, then we'll report that fact to the court, and the law is fairly clear that people cannot be punished for failure to do things they are unable to do,"" he said. http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57364330-281/judge-americans-can-be-forced-to-decrypt-their-laptops/;Many in the legal arena say the issue is a tricky -- and largely unsettled one. A small number of courts have permitted it, but only when prosecutors can point to specifically what files they need and where they are located. In the motion filed earlier this week, Assistant County Prosecutor Matthew Meyer stated the law is not clear. http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/03/bedford_judge_case_highlights.html;disobeying a judge's order to hand over a password could result in contempt of court charges or being jailed.http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/03/bedford_judge_case_highlights.html;If a person is to be punished criminally, then the contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but once the charge is proven, then punishment (such as a fine or, in more serious cases, imprisonment) is imposed unconditionally.A court cannot maintain an order of contempt where the imposed party does not have the ability to comply with the underlying order. This claim when made by the imposed party is known as the ""impossibility defense"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court#United_States;the government must prove the existence and location of the subpoenaed documents and possess independent evidence, other than compliance with the court order, for authenticating them [1, p. 581]. In other words, law enforcement cannot simply go on a fishing expedition, hoping to turn up data that will be evidentiary [8]. They must be able to demonstrate the existence and likely location of specific documents. http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html;United States v. Kirschner (2010): Kirschner was indicted for child pornography charges, and the government subpoenaed his encryption key to gain further evidence from his encrypted drive. In this case, the judge determined that requiring a defendant to supply his password would violate his right against self-incrimination.United States v. Doe (2012): Doe was charged with child pornography. He refused to supply his decryption key and was found in contempt of court, then jailed. A judge then ruled that supplying his decryption key would be tantamount to self-incrimination, so Doe did not have to supply it. http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html;In contrast, law enforcement in the Kirschner and Doe cases did not have prior evidence that illegal content was on their computers. In these cases, officers had suspicion of wrongdoing and were relying on the revelation of decryption keys to investigate and uncover evidence. The court in Kirschner determined that sharing the key would be testimonial because it would demonstrate knowledge of the password and access to the underlying computer files providing the password would reveal the contents of an arrestees mind by recalling the password [5, pp. 1171-1172], [6]. Simply put, because the password was not written down (or already known to law enforcement) in Kirschner and Doe, and it existed only in their minds, compelling a defendant to reveal it would be self-incriminating testimony.If law enforcement can describe the existence and location of evidence, they have a stronger case for requiring access; however, if they cannot demonstrate prior knowledge of the likely data, separate from a compelled revelation from a defendant, then law enforcement has a weaker position.http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html;In re Boucher (2009): Boucher entered the United States from Canada. A border agent examined Bouchers computer and found child pornography after Boucher supplied the password. The agent then shut down the computer and arrested Boucher. Shutting down the computer triggered the encryption again, and prosecutors could no longer see or find the illegal images. Boucher was ordered by the courts to supply the password, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. The courts subsequently ruled he had to supply a decrypted copy of the drives contents. Commonwealth v. Hurst (2011): Hurst was charged with offenses related to inappropriate sexual relations with a minor. Police suspected incriminating evidence was on Hursts cellphone, but he refused to supply the password. Before this case reached the court system, Hursts wife supplied the password, and Hurst himself pled guilty. United States v. Fricosu (2012): Fricosu was indicted for mortgage and real estate fraud. She refused to surrender the password (at one point saying she forgot the password) to encrypted files that, the government believed, would incriminate her. The court ordered her to supply a decrypted version of the hard drive, rather than her password. Subsequently, a co-defendant supplied the needed passwords. ;Law enforcement saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the Pearson, Boucher, Hurst and Fricosu cases. Both Pearson and Boucher voluntarily agreed to let law enforcement search their computers; during those searches, the officers saw evidence. It was only after the initial search that the question of encryption became relevant. In these cases, because the defendants had permitted investigators to see at least some of the evidence, this sufficed to render the existence of all the illegal files a foregone conclusion rather than testimonial evidence [8, p. 544]. Hurst had sent inappropriate messages to a minor, which were visible on the minors phone. While the police sought confirmation of the transmission by searching Hursts phone, they had sufficient evidence without that step. In the Fricosu case, police had recorded conversations between the defendant and her husband (a co-defendant) that revealed the existence and content of the sought-after documents. http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html"
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:36:50","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Greetings comrades.           Through my research I have put together some security measures that should be considered by everyone. The reason I put this together is mainly for the newbies of this forum. But if I can help anyone out, then I am grateful for this. I would like to start out by saying, if you are reading like, you are likely a Silk Road user. If this is the case, then the #1 thing you must be using to even access this form is  Tor. Tor will provide you with a degree of anonymity by using an 128-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). There has been some debate as to whether or not the NSA can crack this code, and the answer is likely yes. This is why, you should never send anything over Tor that you aren't comfortable sharing with the entire world unless you are using some sort of PGP encryption which we will talk about later.           Communication from your computer, to the internet relies on an entry node which basically ""enters your computer"" into the Tor network. This entry node communicates with your computer, this entry node knows your IP address. The entry node then passes your encrypted request onto the relay node. The relay node communicates with the entry node and the exit node but does not know your computer's IP address. The exit node, is where your request is decrypted and sent to the internet. The exit node does not know your computer's IP, only the IP of the relay node. Using this model of 3 nodes it makes it harder, but not impossible to correlate your request to your original IP address.            The problem comes obviously when you are entering plain text into TOR because anybody can set up an exit node. The FBI can set up an exit node, the NSA, or any other foreign government, or any malicious person who may want to steal your information. You should not be entering any sensitive data into any websites, especially when accessing them over TOR. If any of the nodes in the chain are compromised, and some likely are, and the people in charge of those compromised nodes have the computing power to decrypt your request, then you better hope it wasn't anything sensitive.            So what can we do to fix this? Well, luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called Hidden services. You can easily recognize these services by the address  .onion. These services offer what's called end-to-end encryption. What this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands. The web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node, which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message, not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker. Remember, the exit node has the key to decrypt your request. The exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it. So if you are entering your name and address into a field, the exit node has your information. If you are putting a credit card, a bank account, your real name, even your login information, then you are compromising your identity.                    Another step you can take, is to only visit websites that use something called HTTP Secure. You can tell if the website you are visiting is using HTTP Secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address. If you see  https:// then your website is using HTTP Secure. What this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them, and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised Tor exit node. This is another form of end-to-end encryption. If somebody were to intercept your request over HTTP Secure, they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it.            Another reason you want to use HTTPS whenever possible, is that malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text, but HTTPS reduces this possibility. You must be made aware however, that HTTPS can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it. When you visit a website using HTTPS, you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key. This is how cryptography works. A public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key.            Unfortunately, many websites today are still using private keys that are only 1,024 bits long which in today's world are no longer enough. So you need to make sure you find out which level of encryption the website you are visiting uses, to make sure they are using at a minimum 2,048, if not 4,096 bits. Even doing all of this unfortunately is not enough, because we have another problem. What happens if the web server itself has become compromised? Maybe your TOR nodes are clean, maybe you have used HTTPS for all your requests, but the web server itself of the website you are visiting has been compromised. Well then all your requests are again, as good as plain text.   With that being said, this will conclude the first post in this series of the steps we can take to protect our privacy online, to remain anonymous and maintain our freedom.",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:40:15","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security","    Ok, so by now I am assuming you have Tails running. Let's learn how to use PGP within Tails. First thing you are going to want to do is create your own personal key, which consists of your public key that you can give out to people or post in your profiles online. As mentioned before, this is the key people use to encrypt messages to send to you. Your personal key also consists of your private key which you can use to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your PGP public key.     If you look up to the top right area, you will see a list of icons, and one o them looks like a clipboard. You need to click on that clipboard and click  Manage Keys  Next click  File -> New Select PGP Key and click Continue Fill out your full name (I suggest you use your online name, not your real name) Optionally fill out an email and a comment as well. Next, click Advanced Key Options. Make sure Encryption type is set to RSA and set key strength to 4096. Once you have done this, click Create and it will generate your key.     Once you have done this, you can view your personal key by clicking the tab  My Personal Keys. You have now created your personal key! To find your PGP public key, you right click on your personal key and click Copy and it will copy your PGP public key to your clipboard, in which you can paste anywhere you wish. A PGP public key will look something like this.  -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  mQINBFLLWDcBEADEzn3mnLsezUDDAS5Q0lm1f6JdkI534WPuRlAN8pnuQsCSwUQU hPEAgNCUNhxN4yCJ1mDt9xpXpX8QzsMIcofCHeE9TMLAnHzbmXLLi+D8sPZpLpDN 6jEIFvmBD4dvp5adimvRl8Ce49RpO345VUz8Ac0qLSmsv2u+kQviDQXZkrrxXHnA IalvgDopXTISa9Sh7J3HHYYQazOZt9mfAjjuuRdaOqmAAtEe9dl43nrx+nSd/fqH 13XvMKhqJhIoJ02CBFfRBm86vtx5yiXqHZX438M9kbASqU0A2jAfRd+IZG5Z9gCI W6FTror+F4i+bEdAuGTG1XFsQSgjKTIG0vgYiTJ93C2MZxrLvNnJp0g2zD0URyk8 Y2IdyCDfIL10W9gNMqLmjD0z/f/os66wTJkflSGaU9ZsrKHUKFN5OSfOZtNqktWn fCpY4bigkJ8U/5C8mtr9ZE3Tv+RV4rPY0hAOtZucnhlRmYKVFNjvbS0MjqA1188c wzBNG0XcpCNtmM5UsSvXwnDoUaEMXe50Hikxdk3d+CJzqYnor72g/WmIDROCiXl6 2D9rJ2JuLpl9bQLM+KCbXJf3kUSvzszZGXL/AwmynvqlruaXqr5975sCdfqXVexx 1sxsLofOzE01xSDEJRWwHQPlxTKPZFnXD709Xumjdinjv1w4onLk04Z96wARAQAB tC5Kb2xseSBSb2dlciAoVGhleSB3b3VsZCBsaXZlIGFuZCBkaWUgdW5kZXIgaXQp iQI3BBMBCgAhBQJSy1g3AhsDBQsJCAcDBRUKCQgLBRYCAwEAAh4BAheAAAoJEPuh 6tSg81nyzNsP/2ayrAz4InCK/ZnyRnnsjSHIXMv7t2uDTbYomA/0B6v/S6wHMNZX G6+sYg41mfMuZEimgavNb0Uc2r6mI7UyWy5lp1Gd/D+all81X7bm5EBpvl1isPgJ EqjehEdh9FQjrTiRIJafM1m254hIAaZ1RvAphI0tM2lpudk+tNKq+ivV8PpsN9TP 0mg5ZAu1lIKtG9k5vS9HAQ0grJ01TFMEjlifrf7eRyJ1+dmRJ+Xtoy2js8UwS+wM RrIi3G39P2BfEZFQka3EmQ2JgN4pDWFoI0hODGhTba8Z0XSnVtabOTi1TOWIFmFu yqA9bNtuOt3KhIC/O+mEATRsc/VPbTY+80kf45LwlDBfKO3PcOXSOG7ygibzEqXn Ms/Rfe1kNEBeR9Wx2NMJSdxypqGij17CLJwNLC3KypTIQrhzy3YAndeDG4TadW2P v/FJxhz+MX+s+9VeX2fGC0Fsfp8JbeWMAznp8Rf6O/tzEYW+pbLoLRPdi/DvFBZV yWGPspzt3Qspm+BHbeW9iFjvCyvP2/DrKmQM7ABuRh/TMZR7uQ5na11L8rf3nzrS Al/lSul42xLzxG+h9mDixXd1Vh6rVGMbCjL7wO25TUneFo13U5J+klo1blQWV/DL FZUwhh2utWNCMCtcdRW0HYa14Wdyy7H68WmsJqBWUsbyD9PZ2gSawBy7uQINBFLL WDcBEACg3IOme+sg0OZN349UYRr9/O6uW2vC5x9/azZrFNSNYh/LFJTt3XI/FsjN gCj6NxRxbfdyLjL1gxSlJyFtclkFGS0lC0GIz7lINvemkewjde/bHXChz2IIaIli L2A6Z6w3fP4jlQCw8NoGGJ360WMkZVTDDakYYkb50BrZSx4TVLjrHfFuLMXTE255 gQrId02jYO6240EDIhHITuiSwUQvHtXlOrHSohN83TD1I4H7iH/FLae9gYh4C/Ix VLkzLUqvpf72Q/xogCZAJl4WEMmWD6dXufvyvhCXQnbjiLuAdQas0ef/t652LPw/ vJFDSDmguw9PXWpv3vFOe13UNU//+nw3kIGxaVWGvazXk8IFiDv9USgEGjcNn4zo 8HQlQrYz9/gyI3XojGV6L8iecWpHSweqR3NxKJmWKWEG1wwnWPL8M+z6OwEvRdxV spy+eG0Zs+6igbw3tk6gJ4cq5ehdlmD6py27AhRhlj7uLlZxmK3uFV19QjtX/Dyt 73ZNX16krXqufl0HAJRd1PwhITPCtSviW3L2qKF2Pdak3j97A656EcInCcAyOUC/ mUNUDtXJik6uwFgFFn9/pnFr+acY7ppsWPG5rr7jRj+Lgjnjkckpkjo8jN1hZE17 CfJyrYrSqdglCcIgTHteIEZdPfPUmnbbSoyeufkyEW1AoIKatQARAQABiQIfBBgB CgAJBQJSy1g3AhsMAAoJEPuh6tSg81ny4nIP/2lVf0DTp1n5xPEBZEUlgzcMNeh5 FTIS3J44g5a+OlkRVgHFtu7K/MUsftlUzkvMMa0sXllhKc6syxcytoD7LAt9tbQh 62yEzijTliU2QFgWJSS6IfbtC2IyRouAns3KD6XouKTFUs/i0n/QpwhnM+Ya/SAg c/oroM7SE/T4g+v6EeRCq7In/TMgc74j+25zUF1rVSCenbZKkYezxqZ33cXLwl7l IUBcK2uNHDBUB5G853NR0OkBm5i+KC8vM3K1/MZ+P/lK0xOcTGXZH/A7GrEsI4FJ nw5i6zJZb8gmDt44Tp/1Ujxnm5xhVWgnOQeSVSyiRsHQ/gTCL1PqsZhW7yulwL05 yxZgN+oYVx4pNtLJMigRjoCY9IKEmZhY75cWXXA19j14Wnxu8IrwwSk1WyzMQcjj 7onP4OEhbPuotqWqVAc0M/+MV5oMGIG0Qepy6XpZOCCpZw/p1rDrZSYP5eQMd/4x LB7xch6GjbWsnKhA1wGdjdclBodixorVfCRn4s5jTgXx7wWz/opM4ix/CPAkify7 4Sf0BdJ5YtFILZc5StED4WC5pljJbdEWVsb9rn6egvFn7W/ZlDJAerS6Mt5LJGAh Aude0Kz2HJwDtOBF4nXeTzRCK5BrBnCYPHAtO2aqfowirzjMTd9A/ADoPmIbIJAm 04mA6krRiH909Bnx =Az2N -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----     Next, you are going to want to save the private key on a secondary USB drive or SD card. If you are running Tails from a USB drive, then you must use a separate drive to store your key on. If you are running Virtual Box, you want to  right click on the icon in the bottom right corner that looks like a USB drive, and select your separate drive that you will be using to store your keys on. Again, never store your private keys on your hard drive, keep them OFF your computer.      To save your private key, you are going to right click on your personal key and click Properties. I know you probably saw where it says Export, but this is not what you want to do. Clicking export will ONLY export your public key and will not save your private key. If you lose your private key, you can never recover it even if you create another personal key using the exact same password. Each private key is unique to the time it was created and if lost, is lost forever. So once you have clicked  Properties, go over to the tab  Details and click  Export Complete Key.      Once you have done this, you have saved your personal key for future use once you restart Tails. Remembering that Tails is not installed on your hard drive, so every time you restart Tails you lose all your keys. By saving your keys onto a USB drive or SD card, you can import your keys for use every time you restart it.      Next you are going to want to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using your key. Well, luckily for me, Tails has already made a tutorial on how to do this, so I will refer you to their webpage. But before I do that, I need to mention that you need to find somebody else's PGP public key, or you can practice by using your own. Needless to say, the way you import other people's keys into what's called your  key ring is by loading them into a text file. You do this with the program called  gedit Text Editor.     Click Applications -> Accessories -> gedit Text Editor and enter in someone's public key and hit save. Next you can return to your key program from the clipboard icon and click File -> Import and select that file. It will import that person's public key into your key ring. To add future public keys to your key ring, I suggest reopening the same file and just adding the next key below the previous key and each time you open that file it will load all keys within that file. This way you can keep all the PGP public keys together in one file and save it on your SD card or USB drive for future use.     Finally you can use the following 2 pages to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using PGP.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography/index.en.html  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/decrypt_verify/index.en.html     Until next time. Have fun with your new found ability to communicate in PGP!",""

Unfortunately they busted him on an unrelated charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers. Whether or not he was related to child porn or not, is unknown to me, or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way, the feds ended up injecting malicious Javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites, this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds. I suggest you read the following article to learn more about this.  https://openwatch.net/i/200/         With that being said, you may want to disable Javascript in your browsers, especially when visiting certain websites like Silk Road that may become compromised one day. Many users refuse to visit the original Silk Road website and forums with Javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious Javascript to identify users.      In Tails, the browser is called Iceweasel and when Tor in ran in Windows, it uses Firefox. Both browsers can disable Javascript using the exact same method. Open up a Window and type the following command in the address bar, ""about:config"" and click the button that says ""I'll be careful, I promise.""      This will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top. Enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries, ""javascript.enabled"" and ""browser.urlbar.filter.javascript"". Right click on these and click ""Toggle"" and you will see the Value changed to false. If you want to enable Javascript again, just click Toggle again and you will see the value change back to true.     Again, remember that every time you restart Tails you will have to do this again, so get into a habit of doing this every time. You never know when your favorite website could become compromised.      Moving onto meta data. There is a bit of a famous story about an online hacker named w0rmer that would take pictures of his girlfriend and post them online after he would deface a webpage. What he either forgot, or didn't know was that photos taken with the iPhone and other smart phones save the GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken and store it in the meta data of the picture. Check out this article below.   https://encyclopediadramatica.es/W0rmer     You need to remove this meta data! Otherwise you could end up in federal prison with w0rmer. Luckily Tails has a solution for this! See why I love Tails?      Applications -> Accessories -> Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit     Please get a more clear idea of how this works by reading the following page.  https://mat.boum.org/     Please note the currently supported formats. In terms of pictures, jpg, jpeg and png. But unfortunately MAT is not perfect and I wouldn't solely rely on it, so a better idea would be to never upload pictures of yourself or your significant other online, especially bragging about a hack you committed. Please read the site provided above for more information.",""

A photo taken with a GPS-enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken, and the unique ID number of the device - this is all done by default - often without the user's knowledge.      In December 2012, anti-virus programmer John McAfee was arrested in Guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in Belize, which shares a border. Vice magazine had published an exclusive interview with McAfee ""on the run"" that included a photo of McAfee with a Vice reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image. The photo's metadata included GPS coordinates locating McAfee in Guatemala, and he was captured two days later.     To avoid this, only take photos that use PNG because it does not store EXIF data. To check if your photo has any revealing EXIF data attached to it, check out this site.  http://www.viewexifdata.com/  or you can download a tool by doing a quick search online to see what EXIF data may be contained in your photos before you upload them. Be very careful with any files that you upload online, because you never know what type of harmful data could be attached in them. It helps to use Tails, but always consider everything you put online as a potential piece of evidence to be used against you and always prepare for the day the feds come to your door. ",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:44:46","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Welcome back readers!     Today I want to talk about a greatly debated topic.   Should I use a VPN with TOR?  Should I use TOR to connect to a VPN, or use a VPN to connect to TOR?     Let me say first of all, that when you are browsing the internet without TOR, you should probably be using a VPN regardless of whether or not you are using TOR. And make sure that the VPN uses some form of encryption as well. For those of you who are very beginner, think about when you connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop, or an airport and you get all these warnings that your requests sent over this network are vulernable.      All networks, but especially public wifi networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis. Put this together with the fact that some internet service providers monitor your activity to some level, and you can see why it might be a good idea to always use an encrypted method of using the internet. At the very least to protect your personal information when you are entering credit cards, usernames and passwords, as well as other personal data online. Again, especially if you are using a public wifi network.      Choosing a VPN that uses at least 128 bit encryption like TOR is good practice, and will stop the majority of eavesdroppers. But if you can get 256 bit encryption, you are even safer. Before we get into whether or not we should be using a VPN together with TOR, I want to give you a few warnings regarding how you should be using a VPN.     If you are going to be using a VPN for any type of freedom fighting, make damn sure that your VPN does not keep logs. This is actually a lot harder than you might think. Many VPN providers will claim to not keep logs of your activity in order to gain you as a customer, because they have to compete with the other providers out there. Customers are going to trend towards providers who offer no identifying data retention. Unfortunately, this claim of theirs is not always the real case and I will give you an example.     There is a well known VPN provider named HideMyAss that previously claimed not to keep logs of its users. Unfortunately, when met with a court order from their government in the UK, they handed over evidence of a suspected hacker from an internet group LulzSec which helped lead to his arrest. The story can be found below.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/     One of the take home quotes from this article is the following.      A very smart man that goes by the online handle The Grugq, said when doing your freedom fighting online that nobody is going to go to jail for you, and he is 100% correct. When it comes down to it, no VPN provider is going to risk jail to protect a $20 a month subscriber. No matter how tough they sound, no matter how much they claim to care about protecting their customers, when faced with a choice to give you up or go to jail, they will always choose freedom.     Another thing to consider however, is using a VPN does hide your internet activity from your internet service provider. It can also hide the fact that you are using TOR, which may flag some suspicion when the feds start asking ISPs to provide data about their users. This may or may not be relevant, since many people use TOR and you can argue there are many legitimate reasons to use TOR and nothing suspicious about TOR. But it is just another factor to arouse suspicion that may or may not come into play and should be considered.      If you choose to use TOR over a VPN, the benefits are that you would be again, hiding from your ISP the fact that you are using TOR. Also, your VPN would only be able to see that you are connecting to TOR nodes and that you are sending encrypted data. The VPN would not be able to see what data you are sending over TOR unless they decrypted it, because remember, all information relayed over TOR is encrypted.      The downsides of course, as mentioned are that VPN providers may or may not log everything that you do in the form of meta data or even content if they have the storage capacity, and keep those logs on hand for a long time. In this case, it is no better than connecting to TOR through an ISP. Another thing to mention to those who will use VPNs when not using TOR, but also use VPNs when using TOR is remember when you are, and are not connected to your VPN. Sometimes VPNs can unexpectedly drop connections and you may not even be aware of it. If the reason you are using a VPN is to hide TOR activity from your ISP, then if your VPN drops, your ISP will start seeing your TOR traffic instead.     Or, maybe you forget that you are connected to your VPN and end up punching in your address on Google Maps to find directions somewhere. Well guess what Google does with all data entered into their system? They keep it. And they likely keep it indefinitely. So if one day the NSA identifies you on the TOR network by occupying a large number of nodes and using traffic analysis to identify you based on statistical analysis, it will link them to your VPN IP address.      At this point, they will likely ask the VPN to turn over data on their users, but if the VPN refuses to comply because they are not subject to US law, or the laws of other countries, they may check some of the big surveillance websites out there to see if you slipped up and used that IP address for anything else online. They will check logs from Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and other big data collection companies to see who has been using that IP address to connect to their servers.     If you accidentally punched in your address on Google when connected to that VPN, you are now a suspect. So always keep things like this in mind. Just because you are covered behind a VPN does not mean you are not traceable by human error. The benefits of TOR, are that you get a new identity every time you connect. This may or may not be the case with your VPN, so please check and make sure.     Next post we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using TOR to connect to a VPN. [/quote]","We are not intimidated by the US government as some are claiming, we are simply complying with our countries legal system to avoid being potentially shut down and prosecuted ourselves."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:47:27","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Next time I want to talk about is something that most people completely forget about.  Tracking Cookies.  A recent article explains how the NSA uses things like Google Ads and other tracking cookies to identify users over TOR when doing so by other means is not possible.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/nsa-uses-google-cookies-to-pinpoint-targets-for-hacking/     For those of you who do not know what I am talking about, let me ask you this. Have you ever noticed that certain ads seem to follow you around from website to website? Perhaps something you searched for on Google or Yahoo is now showing up in ads on other pages? This was originally designed to market things to you based on your preferences by installing tracking cookies into your browser.      Luckily TOR clears its cookies every time you restart the browser, and yes Tails does too, but that does not mean you are not vulernable within the same TOR session. What I mean by this is, let us say you went and did some freedom fighting on a forum somewhere and then after, using the same Tor session, visited another website with Google Ads on it. Then you went to another site with more Google Ads on it. You would be surprised how many sites now have Google Ads on them, by the way.     Google can use these tracking cookies to learn about your browsing behavior. Your search terms, your preferred sites, and so forth. Some people are even stupid enough to use the same TOR IP address and go check their Facebook news feed or their email. Guess who is in bed with the feds? Google, Yahoo, Facebook, MSN, and all of their email providers as well. Remember, when you start leaving patterns behind, they will start looking for similarities that start with just a suspicion.     Perhaps they correlated the freedom fighting forum posts with you because you logged into your email, and now they start noticing that you always misspell the same words, make the same grammar mistakes, the same slang terms. Perhaps you visited a website belonging to somebody local to you with Google Ads on it. It is not entirely sure how they are able to use these tracking cookies to identify you, but the point is, they keep everything. And if you happen to do something stupid like Google a local restaurant or what movies are playing in your local area on the same IP address that you did something you should not have earlier on, then Google can put 2 and 2 together.     Once they are on your trail, you are screwed. So do not give them anything to correlate to you, ever! So then you might ask, can not I just disable cookies all together? Yes you could, but, cookies are required for things like login sessions. Without cookies, you are unable to maintain a state of being logged in on certain websites, because they use that cookie ID to identify the session on the server. Again, you can certainly disable cookies, but you will not be able to maintain a login anywhere. ",""
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:48:50","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Today we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement (LE) will go to try and catch you slipping.      The thread that inspired this post was the following SR thread.  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=8788.0     The first question is, can LE ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges? Let us just say, that they have done it to a Silk Road user before who went by the name of Flush aka Chronicpain aka Curtis Green  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/vendor-administrator-plead-guilty-in-silk-road-case/3469751/      So as you can see, whether you view it as entrapment or not, once they have evidence against you, they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to Curtis Green.     The Secret Service posed as a vendor for fake IDs online for 5 years and actually shipped fake IDs that they made to buyers on an online Russian forum.   http://www.tested.com/tech/456882-how-secret-service-sold-fake-ids-catch-identity-crooks/      As you can see in this article, the Secret Service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them. Several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their IDs made, resulting in being arrested by the feds.     And in this particular case, the feds charged all the defendants under something called the RICO act.       When you commit crimes online, especially in an online community, the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community. So make sure when you do your freedom fighting, or whatever you choose to do, that you take this into considering. Always weigh out the worst case scenario, should you get busted, because the LE will try and set you up.     One last example of how LE will try and set you up, but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in Los Angeles.  http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/La-Mirada-Inspired-by-the-Simpsons-to-Catch-Criminals-78093912.html      So the reason I made this post, was for those of you who think that LE will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges. They will do it if they want you bad enough, and if you fall for it, they might get you on some tough charges. Curtis Green is facing up to 40 years for the sting operation by the DEA on him and the users who purchased fake IDs on the Russian forum could face up to 20 years each since they can be charged under the RICO act. Always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account.     It only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping. You may only have a few laptops, desktops, servers, but nothing compared to the what they have. Be careful everyone. ","In April 2012, a DEA undercover agent in Maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" on Silk Road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs. ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" instructed [Curtis] Green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs, court papers say. Green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a $27,000 sale of a kilogram of cocaine. Green gave the DEA agent his address.An undercover U.S. Postal Service inspector delivered the cocaine to Green's house in Utah on Jan. 17.;The US Government's ""Operation Open Market"" resulted in indictments against 55 defendants. According to Wired, Special Agent Mike Adams shipped out more than 125 fake IDs over about five years of activity while going by the username Celtic. Amazingly, the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real Celtic, a Nevada man who got caught shopping at a Whole Foods where he'd previously used a fake credit card.Law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities. Adams assumed his online identity and even improved Celtic's cred, shipping near-flawless IDs and becoming a trusted seller on Carder.ru.;""The main indictment is noteworthy because, in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges, the 39 defendants have been charged under the mob-busting RICO act  a first for a cybercrime prosecution.Enacted in 1970 to help the FBI crack down on the mafia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole. The losses collectively inflicted by the Carder.su members are easily enough to give every RICO defendant 20 years in prison."";Sheriff's deputies in La Mirada attempted a rope-a-dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize. Out of the 960 letters sent to these ""people of interest"" only eight showed up at the La Mirada Holiday Inn to collect their prize, according to the Whittier Daily News.Posing as the ""Pelican Marketing Group,"" deputies sent letters last week to people throughout the county wanted in connection with crimes ranging from misdemeanor warrants to murder.According to the report, the suspects were advised to bring their letter and identification to the Holiday Inn, and told that they were guaranteed a prize worth at least $100, and would be one of 200 people with a chance to win a 2010 BMW 238i sedan.They were all smiles when they showed up to collect their prizes, Deputy Janet Ramirez told the newspaper. ""Once they tell them they're under arrest, the smile fades quickly,"" she said."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:50:06","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," This next post I want to focus on more mistakes that other hacktivists and freedom fighters have made which ultimately led to their arrests. This is more proof that you only need to screw up once.     You have probably heard me talk about somebody named  Sabu multiple times and maybe you are new to the online communities and you have no idea who I am talking about. Sabu was the leader of a self proclaimed hacktivist group called LulzSec. They were responsible for taking advantage of security exploits in online servers and posting the information online on a website called PasteBin. They had done this many times.  https://www.informationweek.com/attacks/lulzsec-leader-sabu-unmasked-aids-fbi-hacker-sweep/d/d-id/1103214?      During the time all this was happening, the members of this group maintained an online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel in which they regularly discussed and took credit for their attacks and exploits. The agreed upon ring leader for these attacks, and this group went by the online handle Sabu. Sabu had also been linked to selling stolen credit cards on Facebook through his online handle, not his real one, which carries a charge of aggravated identity theft.      The group had leaked identities of law enforcement, Sony users, and all wreaked all types of havoc online including DDos attacks on the CIA. The FBI wanted Sabu, they wanted the ring leader, who would eventually be facing charges that could lead to 112 years in prison. But as I mentioned in previous threads, it only takes one mistake to get caught. That is all they need.  http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/03/06/exclusive-unmasking-worlds-most-wanted-hacker/      However, this was not his first actual slip up, but it was his first slip up where the feds actually discovered his mistake. His identity was actually discovered, or ""doxed"" previously by another online hacking group called  Backtrace who posted his identity and general location online weeks prior to this in an attempt to dox members of LulzSec.  http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest/      Two mistakes that we know of, is all that it took to bring down at one time, the World's Most Wanted Hacker. If you are familiar with the story of LulzSec, there was a time they were receiving mainstream news coverage and Sabu had gained a reputation of being this mystical untouchable hacker. Unfortunately for him, he made two small yet very costly mistakes which ended up putting him away. But we are not done yet on this story about Sabu.     Sabu had a weakness, that the feds used as leverage against him when he got busted.      So when you are doing your freedom fighting online, you need to ask yourself. What do I have to lose? Do I have a wife? Children? What would happen if I were to lose everything and be thrown away for 10 to 20 years, could I handle that? If you decide that you are willing to risk all that, then you again need to learn from the mistakes of those who have fallen before you. Ask yourself, if put in a hard place, where you had to choose between life in prison, and cooperation, in order to see your own family, you may think you will not talk now, but you may start talking when the feds are threatening to take them away from you forever.      Once the FBI had the leader of the group LulzSec working for them, they wasted little time getting the former hacker to turn on his friends and aid in their arrests.  Continued next post. ","The men have been charged with hacking Fox Broadcasting Company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Public Broadcasting Service (aka PBS). ;Sabu had always been cautious, hiding his Internet protocol address through proxy servers. But then just once he slipped. He logged into an Internet relay chatroom from his own IP address without masking it. All it took was once. The feds had a fix on him.;Sabu occasionally mentioned ownership of a domain called prvt.org in his chats, including those in Backtrace's ""consequences"" document. Every domain registration is associated with corresponding information in the WHOIS database. This information is supposed to include the name and address of the domain's owner.Often this information is incorrect (most domain registrars do nothing to validate it) or anonymized (many firms offer ""proxy"" domain registration, so the WHOIS database contains the details of the proxy registrar, rather than the person using the domain). Monsegur appeared to use one of these anonymizing services, Go Daddy subsidiary Domains By Proxy, for registering the prvt.org domain.The registration for the domain was due to expire on June 25, 2011, requiring Monsegur to renew it. But for some reasonerror on Monsegur's part perhaps, or screw-up by the registrarthe renewal was processed not by Domains By Proxy but by its parent, Go Daddy. Unlike Domains By Proxy, Go Daddy uses real information when it updates the WHOIS database, so on 24th June (the day before it was due to expire), Monsegur's name, address, and telephone number were all publicly attached to his domain name.Monsegur quickly remedied the mistake, changing the WHOIS registration to use various other identitiesfirst to that of Adrian Lamo (who reported Bradley Manning to authorities) and then to ""Rafael Lima"" and subsequently to ""Christian Biermann"". This attempt to mislead those relying on the WHOIS information successfully misled some would-be doxers. But not all: by August there were extensive dossiers on Sabu's true identity.;An unemployed computer programmer, welfare recipient and legal guardian of two young children.It was because of his kids, one of the two agents recalled. Hed do anything for his kids. He didnt want to go away to prison and leave them. Thats how we got him.Monsegur was quietly arrested on aggravated identity theft charges and released on bail. On Aug. 15 he pleaded guilty to a dozen counts of hacking-related charges and agreed to cooperate with the FBI."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T12:51:34","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," In the case that you may have to run, here are some things to consider.     I am not an expert on evading extradition, or how to evade the federal government, NSA or other super powers, but I do have some recommendations that you might want to consider if you decide that you have no other choice but to run. The following countries do not currently have an extradition treaty to the United States.      This does not mean that these countries will not extradite you, but if you are going to pick a country to flee to, it would be favorable to your chance to choose from this list. One noteable country on this list, which is famous for extraditing one of the owners of the  Pirate Bay,  Gottfrid Svartholm to Sweden, is Cambodia. Although no treaty exists between the two countries, he was extradited by the government.      We all know that Edward Snowden fled to Russia from Hong Kong after leaving the US from Hawaii and has remained there since without being extradited by the government and was granted a 1 year temporary asylum. It is unclear if Snowden will be able to stay longer than his 1 year temporary asylum grants, but as of right now he is badly wanted by the US government, and Russia is refusing to hand him over.      Another person involved in the Pirate Bay named Fredrik Neij fled to Laos in Asia following being convicted of ""assisting in making copyright content available"" and was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages of 30 million SEK (approximately 2,740,900 or US$3,620,000). This is of course between Laos and Sweden, but Laos has not extradited Fredrik, so Laos may be a valid option.     I often hear people from the US claim that if ""shit ever pops off"" they would just flee to Canada. Do not even try it, you would not even make it through the border. Canada is like the baby brother of the United States. When the United States says jump, Canada says ""how high?"". Stay away from Canada if you are running from the United States. Even a pot activist named Mark Emery who was a Canadian citizen, lived in Canada, but sold marijuana seeds over the internet to people in the US was extradited to the US to serve a 5 year sentence. According to the other seed vendors in the area, those who only sold within Canada had never been arrested, but because Emery sold to the US, he was arrested and extradited. And of course, we know that Ireland and Australia will likely be extraditing two of the moderators from Silk Road to the United States soon enough.     Although not on the list above, a woman, wanted in the US for parental kidnapping, named Chere Lyn Tomayko was granted asylum in Costa Rica.   http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-07-25-3841863361_x.htm       Assata Shakur was charged with murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, bank robbery, and kidnapping by the US and fled to Cuba. Cuba actually has an extradition treaty with the US, but the relations between the two countries have not been good since the cold war between the US and the Soviet Union and thus the requests were not honored, even for someone with such serious charges. Cuba may be an option for you, but again this is only something to consider as I am no expert in any way.     And finally according to a previous post of mine explaining how the Secret Service sold fake IDs online to people on a forum, several of the members of that forum were able to evade capture due to being in Eastern European countries, although not specified by the feds for obvious reasons, and remain at large to this day.  http://www.tested.com/tech/456882-how-secret-service-sold-fake-ids-catch-identity-crooks/  ","Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bosnia andHerzegovina, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the CentralAfrican Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo (Kinshasa), Congo (Brazzaville), Djibouti, EquatorialGuinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan,Kosovo, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands,Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal,Niger, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Samoa, São Tomé & Príncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia,Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu,Vatican, Vietnam and Yemen.;Tomayko's claims that her actions were justified by domestic violence she suffered were taken into account by the Costa Rican authorities.;The government made its move in 2012, arresting dozens of fraudsters in the US and in countries where extradition is easy. But many more, including the founder of Cards.ru, remain at large. Those in Eastern European countries, especially, are largely out of the government's reach."

They do not have to use your online communications to find out who you are. All that needs to happen, is for you to do something stupid and become a person of interest and they will be monitoring your activities online to the best of their abilities. Remember you only need to screw up once.     For example, maybe you become a person of interest and the FBI gains a subpoena to your Facebook account where you stupidly bragged to a friend of yours about participating in certain online activities. This happened to one of the members of  LulzSec who transferred a data dump that he obtained through SQL injection exploits to a friend of his using his own Facebook in his own name. So do not ever talk about Silk Road or any of your online activities on any social media platform.     Even if a company does not currently keep logs, a court order may perhaps be used to force a company to start keeping logs.  Hush Mail was forced to hand over 12 CDs worth of e-mails from three Hushmail accounts, following a court order obtained through a mutual assistance treaty between the U.S. and Canada. According to the following article.  http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/     When it comes to being threatened by a court order from the federal government, 99.99% of all companies will comply to avoid either prosecution themselves, or shutting down their business as we saw previously with  Hide My Ass.      But one company decided to stand up to this type of bullying that you may have heard of called  LavaBit as seen in the following article.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/lavabit-ladar-levison-fbi-encryption-keys-snowden      You see what I am talking about? The federal government ordered this man to hand over all his encryption keys and SSL keys which compromised the privacy of 400,000 users just so they could gain more data on one man, Edward Snowden. And they used bullying tactics and attempted to bankrupt the owner of Lavabit by fining him $5,000 per day until he handed over the keys. Unfortunately Levison had no choice but to hand over the keys or lose everything.     An interview on Reddit with Levison revealed what he claimed that other secure email providers who threatened to shut down were forced to stay up.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/19/lavabit_analysis/      There you have it. Anyone who tries to stand up to the government, especially in the United States will be met with swift justice, court orders and outrageous fines unless they comply and on top of it, slapped with gag orders so they cannot tell anybody about what the government is doing. ","The email service used by whistleblower Edward Snowden refused FBI requests to ""defeat its own system,"" according to newly unsealed court documents.The founder of Lavabit, Ladar Levison, repeatedly pushed back against demands by the authorities to hand over the encryption keys to his system, frustrating federal investigators who were trying to track Snowden's communications, the documents show.Levison is now subject to a government gag order and has appealed against the search warrants and subpoenas demanding access to his service. He closed Lavabit in August saying he did not want to be ""complicit in crimes against the American people"".In July, the authorities obtained a search warrant demanding Lavabit hand over any encryption keys and SSL keys that protected the site. Levison was threatened with criminal contempt  which could have potentially put him in jail  if he did not comply. Such a move would have given the government access to all of Lavabit users' information.The court ordered Levison to be fined $5,000 a day beginning 6 August until he handed over electronic copies of the keys. Two days later Levison handed over the keys hours after he shuttered Lavabit.;Lavabit's founder has claimed other secure webmail providers who threatened to shut themselves down in the wake of the NSA spying revelations had received court orders forcing them to stay up."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:02:14","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," I just had a realization about something that is pretty important and I wanted to share it with you, regarding security.  Verifying your downloads     As a general rule of thumb, you should  always download files from the home pages of their respective developers.   TOR: https://www.torproject.org Tails: https://www.tails.boum.org Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/     The reason this is so important, is that there are people who host maliciously modified versions of these programs and will host legitimate looking sites to try and get you to download their version, which can install things like backdoors into your computers, keyloggers, and all types of nasty surprises. Sometimes developers will offer mirrors for their projects, which are simply just alternative links to download from in case the main server is too slow, or down. Sometimes these mirrors can become compromised without the knowledge of the developers.      Maybe you do not have TOR or Tails on your laptop and you are traveling out of the country and the hotel that you are staying at has TOR's homepage blocked. There are times when you may need to find an alternative mirror to download certain things. Then of course there is the infamous  man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker can inject malicious code into your network traffic and alter the file you are downloading. The TOR developers have even reported that attackers have the capability of tricking your browser into thinking you are visiting the TOR home page when in fact you are not.     So what do you do about it? You can verify that the file you downloaded is in fact legitimate. The best tool for this is  GnuPG. The TOR developers recommend you get it from the following page (Windows Users).  http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html     You can install this program on your USB drive or on your actual computer, you will hear your actual computer's operation system referred to as your Host OS. So download it, run it, install it and we will start showing you how to use GnuPG.     If you remain on the GnuPG download page you will see something under the big green box that is called  OpenPGP signature. Download that into the same folder as the GnuPG file, this is the file that the download was signed with. Basically someone's signature saying, I made this file. And you also need a PGP public key to verify the signature. So to sum it up so far, the signature is created from the PGP private key, and can be verified by the PGP public key. The signature file is used to verify the program itself. So let us grab the PGP public key for GnuPG as well.      If you look on the same download page, under the heading Installation, you will see a link where it says  verify the integrity of the file. It will lead to you the following page.  http://gpg4win.org/package-integrity.html     Note where it says the following statement.  The signatures have been created with the following OpenPGP certificate Intevation File Distribution Key (Key ID: EC70B1B8). This is the link to the page that hosts the PGP public key file that you need to download, go there. On the page we just navgiated to, go to the bottom right where it says  Intevation-Distribution-Key (public OpenPGP key for signing files) and download that file. This is the PGP public key file, save it to the same place as your signature file for ease of use.      Okay, now that we have both the signature file and the PGP public key, let us now verify our download. First thing you need to do is navigate to the PGP public key file, called  Intervation-Distribution-Key.asc, right click it and go to  More GpgEX Options and down to  Import Keys. This will import the PGP public key into your key ring, and now you can verify the file with the signature.     Right click your actual file you want to verify, in this case  gpg4win-2.2.1.exe and go to   More GpgEX Options and down to  Verify and it should automatically detect the signature file where it says Input File, but if it does not, navigate to the signature file and make sure the box below it where it says  Input file is a detached signature is checked. Look at the bottom and click Decrypt/Verify and you will likely get the following message.   Not enough information to check signature validity. Check details.     Believe it or not, this is completely fine. Click on show details, you are looking for a specific result.   Signed on 2013-10-07 08:31 by distribution-key@intervation.de (Key ID: 0xEC70B1B8). The validity of the signature cannot be verified.     If you navigate back to the page from Gpg4Win that says  Check Integrity where you found the link to the page that contained the PGP public key you will see on that page.   Intevation File Distribution Key (Key ID: EC70B1B8)     Note the key ID from your decrypt result and the key ID from the Check Integrity page and note the email address ending in the same URL that we downloaded the PGP public key from. We have a match! I will explain the reason for this warning message later.     Now that we verified that our verification program is legit. Let us try and verify our Tails ISO file, since if we have a compromised Tails OS, then nothing we do will be anonymous. Let us get right to the Tails download page.  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html     Scroll down to where it says Tails 0.22 signature and download that to your Tails folder where you have the ISO file that we already downloaded. Next scroll down to where it says Tails signing key, this is our PGP public key. Exact same procedure, import the key, then click Verify and specify the signature file if it has not already been specified for you, exact same settings and you will get the same warning message. As explained by Tails      In other words, you need to basically promise that the PGP public key you downloaded is safe by signing the PGP public key with your own private key, but we do not really need to do that and I will not be including a tutorial on how to do that. Tails explains that if you are worried about a compromised PGP public key, just download the key from multiple sources and compare them, if they all match, it is a good chance you are using a legit PGP key. Now let us finally move on to TOR because this one will be a little less straight forward, but once you do this one, you should be able to figure out how to verify anything. Navigate to their download page and find the package that you want.  https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en     To keep things simple let us choose Tor Browser Bundle 3.5, and under the orange box you will see a link  (sig). This is the link for the signature file, I hope by now you know what to do with it. Next we need the PGP public key right? Well it turns out that with so many developers working on TOR, there are multiple PGP public keys, and certain bundles were signed with different keys than other bundles. So we need to find the PGP public key that belongs to our Tor Browser Bundle. Check out this page.  https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en     It has a list of all the signing keys that they use and you can certainly use these key IDs to get what we want by simply right clicking on the signature file and click verify. You will get a warning.    Not enough information to check signature validity. Show Details     And in details it will say the following warning.   Signed on 2013-12-19 08:34 with unknown certificate 0x416F061063FEE659     Keep this entire number in mind for later, it is called a fingerprint. But for now if you just compare the last 8 digits to Erinn Clark's key ID ( 0x63FEE659) provided on the above page, and since she is the person who signs the Tor Browser Bundles you will see they match. But we want to be a bit more thorough, never settle for mediocrity.      Go to your task bar in Windows, and find the program called  Kleopatra, it looks like a red circle with a small white square in it. Right click it and go to  Open Certificate Manager. We are going to import the full keys using this manager. Also note, if you go to the tab that says  Other Ceriticates you will find the Tails and Intevation (GnuPG) keys we used earlier stored for the future when you need to download a new version of those programs and verify them again.  We are going to be following the instructions from the  verifying signatures page on the TOR Project website. Feel free to follow along from that page so you know what I am talking about and where I am getting my URL and numbers from.  https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en     In order to import keys, we need to first add an online directory where they are stored. So let us first add the online directory where the PGP public keys are stored according to the TOR website. Click  Settings then Configure Kleopatra. Next, click New and we are going to enter the following URL which I took right from the page above.  pool.sks-keyservers.net, and leave everything else as default and click OK.     Finally, click the button that says  Lookup Certificates On Server and we will be searching for Errin Clark's PGP public key by searching for her  fingerprint provided on the TOR website page called  Verifying Signatures above, remember, she is the developer who signs the Tor Browser Bundle. The fingerprint we are entering is  0x416F061063FEE659, does this number look familiar? It should, it is the number we got back the first time we tried verifying but without the actual PGP public key. if you get any warnings that pop up when searching just click OK and it should bring up Errin Clark's key, select it and click  Import. You should now have her key listed under  Imported Certificates.     Now let us go back and verify that signature one more time and see what happens. You should get something like the following.   Not enough information to check signature validity.Signed on 201-12-17 12:41 by errin@torproject.org (Key ID: 0x63FEE659).The validity of the signature cannot be verified.     TOR also explains this warning message in their words in case you are still not happy with the warning message.      I do not know about you, but I am happy with the result here, and I am certainly not going to track down Erinn Clark to get her key fingerprint, and it looks like our TOR Browser Bundle is legitimate as well! Now you know what to do when the PGP public key file is not directly hosted on the site itself, you have no more excuses to not verify your downloads. ","If you see the following warning:Not enough information to check the signature validity.Signed on ... by tails@boum.org (Key ID: 0xBE2CD9C1The validity of the signature cannot be verified.Then the ISO image is still correct, and valid according to the Tails signing key that you downloaded. This warning is related to the trust that you put in the Tails signing key. See, Trusting Tails signing key. To remove this warning you would have to personally sign the Tails signing key with your own key.;Notice that there is a warning because you haven't assigned a trust index to this person. This means that GnuPG verified that the key made that signature, but it's up to you to decide if that key really belongs to the developer. The best method is to meet the developer in person and exchange key fingerprints. "
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:03:52","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Guys, I am not going to post exactly who started this thread quoted below, but it belongs to somebody who is a senior member with 375 posts. And he posted some very personal details and probably did not realize how very revealing these details are.      So why is this revealing? Why is this bad you might be asking. Well, Netflix collects metadata on its users just like every other big data corporation. If you are a Netflix user, you likely have a profile which keeps track of every movie you have ever watched and what you rated it and so forth.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/12/17/obama-bidenapple-amazon-twitter-netflix-yahoo-facebook-microsoft-google/4049305/      This user stated, that he just watched a specific movie, that he named. And also stated that this movie has been up since 2010. So how many people do you think watched this exact movie in the time frame that this guy stated he watched it? Probably not too many. Under 100 for sure since the movie has been up for almost 3 years. Well, now the federal government has a list of 100 or less suspects, one of which is this particular user on Silk Road.     But maybe he was using a VPN to connect to Netflix? Great.... does he use that VPN for anything else? Logging into his email, surfing the web, etc... Even if he used a VPN, maybe they keep logs? Maybe they are US based and are easily subject to subpoenas, maybe they will spill everything just like HideMyAss did. We just do not know, but this is exactly the type of information you all should NOT be revealing about yourselves. This is extremely bad OpSec people. Smarten up!     But then I looked even further through this user's profile and looked at his posts. I know which country he lives in, I know which drugs he has imported into his country and I know which countries he has imported those drugs from. This guy has spoken about cooking drugs, he talks about being in a cold part of his country, which not all parts of that particular country ever even get cold which helps law enforcement narrow down that list of suspects they got from Netflix.      If you think that law enforcement is not interested in buyers you are sadly mistaken. Sometimes if they establish that a buyer has been purchasing from a vendor that they are after, then busting the buyer can help them get to the vendor. They may take over the user's online identity and start ordering things from vendors since he already has established a trust with these particular vendors. If the vendor slips up because of the trust built up with the buyer, the vendor is in trouble.      I want you all to learn a lesson from this! If you are going to talk about which vendors you buy off of, which country you live in and which countries you have imported drugs from, then you better make DAMN SURE you do not start giving away details like which movie you watched last night on Netflix. That is almost as bad as logging onto a server with your real IP address. Keep your mouths shut about your personal lives! [/quote]","Track Me If You Can...Awesome bit I just watched on Netflix. This is not terribly new, done in 2010, but he is quite thorough in his demonstrating how to disappear in modern US culture. I do have to add that some of the tech he introduced from the other side is quite alarming. The alphabet cops have waaay too much discretionary income. Time to start defunding them.;Electronic surveillance and the new health care law are on the agenda as Obama and Vice President Biden meet with a group that includes executives from Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google."
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:05:35","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," This post was inspired by a user who posted the following on the Silk Road forums.      We have talked about a large amount of ways to maintain your security, but we have not really talked about how to actually exchange currency. First thing I want to say as a disclaimer, is that I am not advocating that you do anything illegal. This is for educational purposes only and my recommendations are made assuming you are exchanging currencies anonymously as a means to protect your own privacy.     So you have found something online that you want to buy, and they are asking for Bitcoins as payment. How do you get the Bitcoins, and how do you get the Bitcoins to them? We are going to explore these options to a degree and hopefully by then you can make an educated decision on which method is best for your situation.     The options of buying Bitcoins are as follows.  1.  Sign up at an exchange online. Some popular exchanges are MT Gox, BTC-E, BitStamp and Coinbase The downside of purchasing Bitcoins at these exchanges, are that you need to verify your identity with them by means of submitting documents such as a driver's license or passport and a utility bill. If you are able to get past this first obstacle, then you need to find a way to get money into the account. Exchanges generally only accept wire transfers as a way to fund your account, but some of them offer a way of transferring money directly from your bank account. You can obviously see that by doing this you are exposing your true identity to the exchanges in one way or another, if not at the very least your location.  2.  LocalBitcoins.com LocalBitcoins offers a way for you to find a person in your local area, or if you want to go to another state or province to meet up with someone further away from you, you can choose where to look for people in that area selling Bitcoins either online (bank transfer or cash deposit) or meet them for cash in person. Traders have reputation lists, similar to a feedback score on eBay and you can find a trader who has a good reputation to buy off of. You send in a trade request and once the seller has received the money, he can release the Bitcoins from LocalBitcoins and they are sent to your wallet. Some people have expressed concern that law enforcement may act as buyers and sellers on LocalBitCoins, but it does not matter if this is the case in my opinion as long as you are not looking to buy large amounts. You can also, if you want, communicate with the buyer over email, arrive from public transportation, wear a hat, and all sorts of secret agent type tricks to try and conceal your identity. Wear a wig if you are super paranoid.  3.  Use a Bitcoin ATM Currently there is only one ATM in the world that I am aware of, and it is located in Canada. If you do not live in Canada then this does not help you. Luckily according to the an article, the company who is rolling out these ATMs called Robocoin is launching ATMs in other countries as well coming soon.  http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/02/robocoin-the-bitcoin-atm-is-heading-to-hong-kong-and-taiwan/     There will likely be some way to try and cut down on money laundering by getting you to verify your identification, but from what I understand, they currently only do this if you are selling Bitcoins for cash using the ATM, and not buying them for cash. The way that it works, is you choose the amount of BTC you want to buy, and you feed your cash into the ATM machine. You can at that point either print out a generated paper wallet, or choose a wallet of your own to send the Bitcoins to. This method may be another good way because it takes dealing with another human out of the transaction. Something you may need to be aware of is surveillance cameras, so maybe wear a hood, hat, wig, sunglasses, and so forth to disguise yourself if you are worried about your identity.   4.  Craigslist Believe it or not, there are a decent amount of people on Craigslist that you can meet up with in person and buy Bitcoins off of with cash. Your local area may not have a large number of listings, but you can always search in other nearby metropolitan areas and make a day trip out of it if you want. The same considerations about protecting your identity apply here as above.   5.  Mine your own Bitcoins I am not going to get into how to mine Bitcoins, or whether or not you should, but if you want to get Bitcoins without dealing with other people, this is one of the ways you can do it. Run your miners over Tor, stay anonymous and you will have yourself some untainted Bitcoins.     Okay, so now you have yourself some Bitcoins, how can you get them to somebody else that you want to buy something off of or trade with? As you probably know by now, every single transaction is tracked on  BlockChain.info. My wallet address that I have set up for donations for the hours I have spent working on this thread is 1PkJ928QWC5BuQAsHoNQzRV5wfnveJSRCp. You can check out the transactions related to it by going to the following address.   http://blockchain.info/address/1PkJ928QWC5BuQAsHoNQzRV5wfnveJSRCp     So you have Bitcoins sitting in your wallet, and if you send them to somebody else, it will show up on BlockcChain exactly where you sent them. A couple of things to keep in mind.   1. You purchased your Bitcoins from somebody or something. They may have kept a record of the wallet those coins were sent to. 2. If you dealt with a law enforcement or somebody trying to track you, then they can track where the coins are sent after you forward them to somebody else.      Right now the best method of trying to lose this trail is using something called a mixer or a tumbler. You can think of this like throwing your Bitcoins into a giant pile of coins with other users and then withdrawing them at a later time from the mixer. If you threw in 1 Bitcoin and pulled out 1 Bitcoin, think of all the other people who did the exact same thing. Possibly thousands of others withdrawing 1 Bitcoin from the exact same pile of coins. It has now become much harder for you to be linked to those coins. Then on top of that, maybe you do not withdraw 1 Bitcoin, maybe you only withdraw 0.5 Bitcoin right now and leave the other 0.5 Bitcoin in the pile. It becomes even harder to link those Bitcoins to you.      One website that does this is called BitcoinFog and can be found on a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL.   http://www.bitcoinfog.com/  http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/     BitcoinFog has been around for a while now and most people seem happy with the service they provide, so I would come to think that they are a trustworthy service. The way they work is as I mentioned above, and on top of that the service takes 1%-3% (randomized for obscurity) fee on each deposit. So you may put in 1.0 Bitcoins and take out 0.97 Bitcoin after fees and it mixes things up. You can also decide when you might want to withdraw it, whether it is in a month, week, days, and so forth. This is a good service to use and definitely mixes things up for you. The only thing you need to keep in mind, is that there is a trail of you sending your coins into BitcoinFog, which some people may or may not find suspicious. But what you do with your coins after BitcoinFog is going to be extremely difficult to track, if not impossible due to the vast number of transactions that are occuring in and out of BitcoinFog.      When you withdraw your coins from BitcoinFog, please make sure you send them to a  new wallet, and not the same wallet that you used to deposit them into BitcoinFog. Another option you can have when withdrawing the coins from BitcoinFog, is to get BitcoinFog to withdraw the coins directly to the person you want to buy something from. This takes the step of creating a new wallet and then having to forward it on and will keep things again extremely hard to track. Just keep their transaction fees in mind to make sure your desired seller is going to receive the correct amount of Bitcoins needed for the purchase or exchange.     Two other options you can use are provided by Blockchain.info and can be accessed by creating a wallet and logging in to it.  Send Shared and  Shared Coin. Send Shared is another way of mixing up coins, the way that it works is,  you send your money into the giant pot and it gets matched up with somebody else who is sending the same amount. An example of this is let us say we have 4 people. A, B and X, Y. Person A is sending 1 Bitcoin to person B and person X is sending 1 Bitcoin to person Y. Send Shared will match these amounts together, and it will mix them so that person A sends their 1 Bitcoin to person Y and person X sends their Bitcoin to person B. This way you are breaking the chain that links person A to person B because there is no record of person A ever sending anything to person B. This is a very good option to use, and one that many people prefer. Of course, there are many people using Send Shared, so the likelihood of there just being 4 people mixing up transaction is going to be more like 10,000 or more, making it pretty much impossible to track.      Shared coin uses a different method called coinjoin. Shared coin hosts a coinjoin server which acts as a meeting point for multiple people to join together in a single transaction. Having multiple people in a transaction improves privacy by making transactions more difficult to analyse. The important distinction between traditional mixing services is the server cannot confiscate or steal your coins. A sharedcoin transaction will look something like the following.     https://blockchain.info/tx/e4abb15310348edc606e597effc81697bfce4b6de7598347f17c2befd4febf3b     As you can see multiple inputs and outputs make the determining the actual sender and receiver more difficult. Basically it sends the coins in and out of many different wallets that are participating in Shared coin at the time and it does this to throw hundreds or thousands of transactions in all the wallets participating making it extremely difficult to track. The downside though is that coinjoin can never completely sever the link between the input and destination address, there will always be a connection between them, it is just more difficult to analyse. The benefit to Shared Coin is that while this processing is happening, you can hit cancel and get your coins back. When you send your coins into a traditional mixing service, an untrustworthy mixing service could potentially steal your coins.     Now that you have the knowledge to make an educated decision on how to mix up your coins en route to your intended destination, I feel that you can now put your mind at ease when looking to buy something with Bitcoins. It should be noted that you can reverse the process if you want to cash out your Bitcoins as well. ","BEST WAY TO OBTAIN BTC'S? AND HOW DO YOU PROTECT IDENTIY DONIG SO? i just would like to know so i can get over this bump i been learning all this stuff to do shit on these sites for a month now and this is my last obsticle i think?!!;The first shipping bitcoin ATM, Robocoin, is landing in Hong Kong and Taiwan as the company expands its reach this January. They are planning further releases in Europe, Canada, and the US but, given Asias clout in the BTC markets, this is definitely an interesting development. "
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:06:59","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Your computer will always be vulnerable to some sort of attack from those who want to harm you in some way. Whether it is harm your privacy, steal your information or throw you in jail.     It should come to no surprise to us that the US government is actually the largest purchaser of malware.      After reviewing the sources in the article and other articles, some of these defense contractors expressed concern that the government was essentially funding criminal activity. They are paying independent hackers, in some cases blackhats to find zero day exploits (ones that have not been publicly announced yet) and buy these exploits off of them for huge sums up money, upwards of $100,000.     If you are using a laptop with a built-in microphone and camera, you are extremely vulnerable to an attack as John McAffee, the man who started McAffee Anti Virus explains.      So the first thing you should do right now is go grab some opaque tape and put it over your camera. If you are on a desktop and you have a webcam plugged in, unplug it unless you are using it. There is no reason to give an attacker an open window into your home. Next is your microphone, again desktops usually do not have built in microphones, but most laptops do. A microphone can be activated to listen to you talking and you need to find a way to physically disable it. The best way of course is to physically remove it, but I am not writing a tutorial on how to do that.     The FBI developed a keystroke logging software called Magic Lantern. Magic Lantern can reportedly be installed remotely, via an e-mail attachment or by exploiting common operating system vulnerabilities, unlike previous keystroke logger programs used by the FBI. It has been variously described as a virus and a Trojan horse. It is not known how the program might store or communicate the recorded keystrokes.      Then of course we have cell phones which can be activated remotely as well.      According to a few of the sources in the Wikipedia article, the cell phone can be activated to listen to you even when it is off. Pulling the battery will likely do the job, but there is no guarantee. So make sure the phone is not in the same room as you if you are talking about anything sensitive. As always, be super paranoid. Turn on the shower and put the phone in the bathroom if you have to, or better yet if you are going somewhere and you do not need your cell phone, leave it at home. Since most people never leave home without their cell phones, if somebody is snooping on you, they might think you are still at home. The first group of people that went to visit Snowden in Russia were told not to bring any laptops or cell phones with them for those reasons.      So we know the government is actively trying to gain remote access to your computer, they can listen to your phones, what should you do about it ?      You need to do the best you can to make sure the computers that you use are not exposed to the elements of risk. Always disable Javascript when visiting any websites unless the website is 100% trusted. Start phasing out the use of Microsoft Windows and MAC OSX because these closed source proprietary operating systems are not open to scrutiny and auditing the way open source Linux distributions are. There are more Windows users and thus more exploits available for Windows.      Running your operating system in a Virtual Machine, even if your host OS is Linux (remember Virtual Box can run on Linux) will help cut down on the retention of any malware you might pick up when on the internet. Do not go to any potentially harmful sites on your freedom fighting computers. Do not open any emails from anyone that you do not trust 100%. Regularly format your hard drives to keep them clean of any hidden viruses.      If you are unsure if something is safe, test it on a computer only meant for testing and one that is not connected to the internet. If you can reset your boot sector on your hard drive from time to time that would be a good idea as well, because you can get master boot sector viruses that would boot up a virus before your computer even boots into the OS.      Flash your BIOS, the BIOS is the first thing that runs when you turn on your computer, if you have a virus in your BIOS, there is no antivirus that can remove it, you would need to flash your BIOS and install a new firmware. Make sure the firmware is 100% trustworthy as infected firmware is the most common way to get a BIOS virus.      In the interest of saving space I will not go into detail on how to do all of these virus removals because there are numerous tutorials online and I am certainly not an expert in this field.

Cookies     Cookies are pieces of information that a web site can send to your browser. If your browser ""accepts"" them, they will be sent back to the site every time the browser accepts a page, image or script from the site. A cookie set by the page/site you're visiting is a ""second party"" cookie. A cookie set by another site that's just providing an image or script (an advertiser, for instance), is called a ""third party"" cookie.     Cookies are the most common mechanisms used to record the fact that a particular visitor has logged in to an account on a site, and to track the state of a multi-step transaction such as a reservation or shopping cart purchase. As a result, it is not possible to block all cookies without losing the ability to log into many sites and perform transactions with others.     Unfortunately, cookies are also used for other purposes that are less clearly in users' interests, such as recording their usage of a site over a long period of time, or even tracking and correlating their visits to many separate sites (via cookies associated with advertisements, for instance).     With recent browsers, the cookie setting that offers users the most pragmatic tradeoff between cookie-dependent functionality and privacy is to only allow cookies to persist until the user quits the browser (also known as only allowing ""session cookies""). Tails does this automatically by the way with Iceweasel.   Recent Cookie-Like ""Features"" in Web Browsers     In addition to the regular cookies that web browsers send and receive, and which users have begun to be aware of and manage for privacy, companies have continued to implement new ""features"" which behave like cookies but which are not managed in the same way. Adobe has created ""Local Stored Objects"" (also known as ""Flash Cookies"") as a part of its Flash plug-ins; Mozilla has incorporated a feature called ""DOM storage"" in recent versions of Firefox. Web sites could use either or both of these in addition to cookies to track visitors. It is recommended that users take steps to prevent this.     Managing Mozilla/Firefox DOM Storage Privacy. If you use a Mozilla browser, you can disable DOM Storage pseudo-cookies by typing about:config into the URL bar. That will bring up an extensive list of internal browser configuration options. Type ""storage"" into the filter box, and press return. You should see an option called dom.storage.enabled. Change it to ""false"" by right-clicking and choosing Toggle.   Managing Adobe Flash Privacy.     Adobe lists advice on how to disable Flash cookies on their website.  http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. There are some problems with the options Adobe offers (for instance, there is no ""session only"" option), so it is probably best to globally set Local Stored Object space to 0 and only change that for sites which you are willing to have tracking you. On the Linux version of Adobe's Flash plugin there does not seem to be a way set the limit to 0 for all sites and therefore its use should be limited or avoided. Luckily Tails does not have flash installed, but in case you are not using Tails be aware of this.     If you absolutely need to watch a video online, find a way to download the video to your computer and watch it that way. This takes the browser out of the loop of processing a video for you and eliminates those Flash cookies which help identify you.   Javascript     Javascript is probably the grand daddy of all vulnerabilities in internet browsing. The majority of exploits, malware, viruses and other computer take overs happen because of Javascript code executing in your browser. Javascript has many uses. Sometimes it is simply used to make webpages look flashier by having them respond as the mouse moves around or change themselves continually. In other cases, javascript adds significantly to a page's functionality, allowing it to respond to user interactions without the need to click on a ""submit"" button and wait for the web server to send back a new page in response.     Unfortunately, javascript also contributes to many security and privacy problems with the web. If a malicious party can find a way to have their javascript included in a page, they can use it for all kinds of evil: making links change as the user clicks them; sending usernames and passwords to the wrong places; reporting lots of information about the users browser back to a site. Javascript is frequently a part of schemes to track people across the web, or worse, to install malware on people's computers. It is best to disable Javascript ( about:config in URL bar search for Javascript and Toggle it to disabled) unless you absolutely trust the site or use the browser add-on NoScripts that comes with Tails and is available in Firefox to at least selectively block malicious scripts. Disabling Javascript outright is the best option though, and gumby has added a suggestion that can make it even easier to do this.      Javascript can also reveal an alarming amount of information about you even if you are using TOR or a VPN, including your browser plug-ins,  your time zone, what fonts you have installed (flash does this as well) and of course most browsers will send your user agent, meaning they tell the website what browser you are using and in some cases your operating system! Some of these details may not seem very important, but collected as a whole, it can make it easier to identify who you are online by almost generating a finger print of you with your specific settings related to your browser. Then as you hop around from site to site with your finger print, correlations and patterns can be drawn from this and eventually linked to you if you are not extremely careful.     Luckily, Tails and Whonix overrides the majority of this identifying information, so as long as you use Tails with Javascript disabled, or at the very least with NoScripts (Flash is disabled automatically) then you can cut down on the amount of information you share. Needless to say, it is not always possible to browse with Tails, so these are things you need to be aware of when you are browsing with regular browsers on your native OS with your browser of choice.      See what your browser is revealing about you at this page below. Do not visit it from your real IP address, since this page will be linked to the Silk Road forums from the moment I make this post part of my thread. As a result, you may wish to search online for other sites that check what information your browser is revealing about you. If you are confident in your OpSec abilities, use the one below.  http://browserspy.dk/ ","Supposedly NoScript doesn't block all Javascript even when it is enabled and no sites are on the whitelist. Not sure about that claim but I've seen people make it. There's a Firefox add-on (which also works in Tor Browser) called toggle_js which lets you toggle the about:config javascript.enable parameter through a toolbar icon so you don't have to go into about:config. I find it quite useful."

Read on.     The first thing we need to talk about is RAM. RAM stands for random access memory. All you need to know about RAM is that RAM is the place in a computer where the operating system, application programs, and data in current use are kept so that they can be quickly reached by the computer's processor. RAM is much faster to read from and write to than the other kinds of storage in a computer, the hard disk, floppy disk, and CD-ROM. However, the data in RAM stays there only as long as your computer is running. When you turn the computer off, RAM loses its data.     When you turn your computer on again, your operating system and other files are once again loaded into RAM, usually from your hard disk. RAM can be compared to a person's short-term memory and the hard disk to the long-term memory. The short-term memory focuses on work at hand, but can only keep so many facts in view at one time. If short-term memory fills up, your brain sometimes is able to refresh it from facts stored in long-term memory. A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the processor needs to continually go to the hard disk to overlay old data in RAM with new, slowing down the computer's operation. Unlike the hard disk which can become completely full of data, RAM never runs out of memory.     Data can be extracted from the RAM using various tools. When you have a text document open and you are working on it, you are working from the RAM. Meaning that if you are working on a sensitive document, that document is temporarily stored in the RAM and is vulnerable to being extracted while the computer is on. When RAM is being stored, it is being stored  without any form of encryption, making it very easy to steal and a huge security risk.     Shutting down a computer through its normal shutdown cycle usually goes through a process of clearing the RAM. However, if the computer loses power abruptly like in a power outage, the computer does not go through its normal shut down cycle and some information remains on the RAM chips for a few seconds up to a few minutes. This is one of the ways cold boot attacks can work.     I also want to quickly introduce a type of RAM to you which will help you understand the rest of this article better. Below is a research paper and they used a type of ram called DRAM. DRAM stands for  dynamic random access memory. DRAM is the most common kind of random access memory (RAM) for personal computers and workstations. DRAM is dynamic in that, unlike static RAM (SRAM), it needs to have its storage cells refreshed or given a new electronic charge every few milliseconds. DRAM is designed to lose its memory quickly after losing power. Then there are subsections of DRAM called DDR. This is a way of making the memory more quickly available, but it is not really important to fully understand. Wikipedia can give you all you need to know about DDR. In this article we are focusing on just the concept of DDR, DDR2 and DDR3.      These are newer versions of DRAM that keep getting better, and I believe we are currently up to DDR4. But most computers circulating around today have DDR2 and DDR3 in them unless they are older computers, this includes laptops. DRAM is known as a type of volatile memory, it is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information. It retains its contents while powered, but when power is interrupted, stored data is quickly lost. But how quickly is it lost?     In 2008, a group of researchers wanted to see the practicality of extracting unencrypted data from the RAM in your computer. They argued that DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard. And by using an analysis tool they were able to search for key files (such as PGP keys) held in the RAM that could be used to decrypt encrypted volumes (drives) on your computer. They successfully were able to decrypt volumes using BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt. Below is the abstract of their research.   Here is an FLV video you can download to watch exactly how they did it.  https://anonfiles.com/file/97b5737dba6b96871fd862b8a587b8f0      This was very troubling to most people, and had many people freaking out when the research paper was released back in 2008 because even tough encryption tools like TrueCrypt could be rendered useless with an attack like this. Upon further analysis of the paper, I wanted to note that they used SDRAM, DDR and DDR2, and not DDR3 because it was not available at that time. This prompted TrueCrypt to release the following statement on their website.        A few key points to extract from here are that properly shutting down your computer reduces, if not completely enliminates this risk except in the case of encrypted system disks. What is meant by this is, for example, if your main operating system is Windows and you have encrypted that drive, this is your system drive and the master key for that drive is not cleared upon shutdown or restart. The solution is simply to never store anything sensitive on your system volume. Whether you use a partitioned drive or a USB stick that is encrypted, just make sure that your main drive that is booted into does not contain sensitive data. And if you have no other choice, then you need to separately encrypt the data inside the system volume with a different passphrase and private key so that even if they get into your system volume, they cannot access the other encrypted data you want to protect.      They can use these same techniques to sniff around for your PGP private key files in the RAM, so this is a very real threat in the case that if your computer is still powered on if they come to get you, they can use these techniques to retrieve data from your computer. However, there is a debate about whether or not this type of attack can persist even now into 2014 with newer types of RAM. I point to a random blog online and I make no judgement as to whether or not this is a legitimate claim, but it is interesting nonetheless.   The user claimed to be using a newer type of RAM called  DDR3. which is known to hold memory for a much shorter time than DDR2. And a newer research paper released in September 2013 tried to reproduce the findings of the 2008 research but using computers with DDR1, DDR2 and DDR3 and their findings were interesting.      So what does should you do? Number one, always shut down your computer when you are not around it or put it into hibernation mode, otherwise your sensitive documents could be lingering around in your RAM. Simply locking the screen will do you no good. Make sure your computer is using a DDR3 type of RAM, if possible. Some of you this means you need to upgrade. If you are unsure what kind of RAM your computer has, search online to find a tool that will detect it for you. Never store anything sensitive on an encrypted  system volume, because this attack can be used to break into the volume and anything unencrypted can be retrieved. If you are using a laptop, pull the battery out so that if you need to quickly pull the power, it will turn it off immediately. If you have time, shut down the computer, otherwise turn it off immediately so that it is not running. The more time you can waste are precious seconds where they cannot retrieve any data. So immediately shut things off if you do not have enough time to do a proper shutdown.      Consider putting a lock on your computer case, and if you want to go take it a step further, bolt it to the floor. That way the amount of time it would take them to get inside your computer would waste valuable minutes and more than likely render any recoverable memory useless. Some people have even suggested that you solder the RAM into the motherboard so they cannot take it out. This may help slow things down, but remember that cooling the memory down can preserve things for quite a while if you are using DDR1 or DDR2. With DDR3, you should be good to go and I believe with this realization, manufacturers will likely start looking at ways to encrypt RAM, but until that time you do need to be aware of this as a possible means for stealing your sensitive data and something you should keep in the back of your mind and prepare yourself for just in case.","Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption KeysAbstract Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard. Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not refreshed, they are not immediately erased, and their contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems  BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt  using no special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several strategies for partially mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them.https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/ [Abstract]http://citpsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oldsite-htdocs/pub/coldboot.pdf [Full Text];Unencrypted Data in RAMIt is important to note that TrueCrypt is disk encryption software, which encrypts only disks, not RAM (memory).Keep in mind that most programs do not clear the memory area (buffers) in which they store unencrypted (portions of) files they load from a TrueCrypt volume. This means that after you exit such a program, unencrypted data it worked with may remain in memory (RAM) until the computer is turned off (and, according to some researchers, even for some time after the power is turned off*). Also note that if you open a file stored on a TrueCrypt volume, for example, in a text editor and then force dismount on the TrueCrypt volume, then the file will remain unencrypted in the area of memory (RAM) used by (allocated to) the text editor. This applies to forced auto-dismount too.Inherently, unencrypted master keys have to be stored in RAM too. When a non-system TrueCrypt volume is dismounted, TrueCrypt erases its master keys (stored in RAM). When the computer is cleanly restarted (or cleanly shut down), all non-system TrueCrypt volumes are automatically dismounted and, thus, all master keys stored in RAM are erased by the TrueCrypt driver (except master keys for system partitions/drives  see below). However, when power supply is abruptly interrupted, when the computer is reset (not cleanly restarted), or when the system crashes, TrueCrypt naturally stops running and therefore cannot erase any keys or any other sensitive data. Furthermore, as Microsoft does not provide any appropriate API for handling hibernation and shutdown, master keys used for system encryption cannot be reliably (and are not) erased from RAM when the computer hibernates, is shut down or restarted.**To summarize, TrueCrypt cannot and does not ensure that RAM contains no sensitive data (e.g. passwords, master keys, or decrypted data). Therefore, after each session in which you work with a TrueCrypt volume or in which an encrypted operating system is running, you must shut down (or, if the hibernation file is encrypted, hibernate) the computer and then leave it powered off for at least several minutes (the longer, the better) before turning it on again. This is required to clear the RAM.* Allegedly, for 1.5-35 seconds under normal operating temperatures (26-44 °C) and up to several hours when the memory modules are cooled (when the computer is running) to very low temperatures (e.g. -50 °C). New types of memory modules allegedly exhibit a much shorter decay time (e.g. 1.5-2.5 seconds) than older types (as of 2008).** Before a key can be erased from RAM, the corresponding TrueCrypt volume must be dismounted. For non-system volumes, this does not cause any problems. However, as Microsoft currently does not provide any appropriate API for handling the final phase of the system shutdown process, paging files located on encrypted system volumes that are dismounted during the system shutdown process may still contain valid swapped-out memory pages (including portions of Windows system files). This could cause 'blue screen' errors. Therefore, to prevent 'blue screen' errors, TrueCrypt does not dismount encrypted system volumes and consequently cannot clear the master keys of the system volumes when the system is shut down or restarted.http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/unencrypted-data-in-ram;Now to test the actual cold-boot attack. Fill memory with around 1000 taint markers, just to be sure there are enough.Now shut down. Ostensibly, the markers could be recognizable in RAM after whole minutes, but Im impatient, so I just waited 10 seconds for the first test. Boot up, into the minimal linux installation. Load the kernel module: insmod ./rmem.ko. Run hunter.Nothing.Thats ok, though. There should be at least some data corruption. The default marker size is 128 bytes, so lets set the hamming distance to 128, meaning that one bit out of every byte is allowed to be flipped. (Statistically, thats equivalent to a 25% corruption rate, since a corrupted bit has a 50% chance of remaining the same).Nothing.Looks like in 10 seconds, memory was completely corrupted. Lets try a shorter interval: 2 seconds. Same results. Nothing is left of our encryption key.http://bytbox.net/blog/2013/01/cold-boot-attacks-overrated.html;Even though a target machine uses full disk encryption, cold boot attacks can retrieve unencrypted data from RAM. Cold boot attacks are based on the remanence effect of RAM which says that memory contents do not disappear immediately after power is cut, but that they fade gradually over time. This effect can be exploited by rebooting a running machine, or by transplanting its RAM chips into an analysis machine that reads out what is left in memory. In theory, this kind of attack is known since the 1990s. However, only in 2008, Halderman et al. have shown that cold boot attacks can be well deployed in practical scenarios. In the work in hand, we investigate the practicability of cold boot attacks. We verify the claims by Halderman et al. independently in a systematic fashion. For DDR1 and DDR2, we provide results from our experimental measurements that in large part agree with the original results. However, we also point out that we could not reproduce cold boot attacks against modern DDR3 chips. Our test set comprises 17 systems and system configurations, from which 5 are based on DDR3.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6657268&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6657268"

OpSec stands for Operations Security and in this context refers to people keeping themselves anonymous online. He goes by the online handle, ""The Grugq"", and Grugq has his own blog which can be found at the following webpage.       http://grugq.github.io/     It should be noted that Grugq was at one time on the payroll of the US government for finding and selling zero day exploits. If you remember the previous post about how the US federal government is the singlemost purchaser of malware in the world, well Grugq was one of those who sold malware to the government. Unfortunately for him, when he went public about it, they no longer wanted to buy malware from him because they like to maintain their own anonymity when purchasing these exploits. And here is a short biography from an online website.      Why are we talking about the Grugq? Who cares? Well, he has some of the best information on keeping yourself anonymous and maintaining privacy online and he is somebody who you should all familiarize yourselves with. He writes blog posts, and he has done video presentations at security and hacker conferences, with his most famous presentation, at least in the world of Silk Road being the one he did on OpSec. Since I know it is hard for Tails users to watch videos on YouTube, I decided to download it from YouTube and upload it to AnonFiles.com so you all can watch it. The presentation is about 1 hour long, and an essential to everyone who wishes to maintain their anonymity online. Remember, you only have to screw up once.      https://anonfiles.com/file/b6de41da8d1fca2fabf725f79d2a90df      SHA1 Sum: 1a9e6c67a527b42a05111e1b18c7a037744bb51e     MD5 Sum: b6de41da8d1fca2fabf725f79d2a90df     Once you have downloaded the file, I want you to check something called the checksum of the file. The checksum is where the contents of the entire file get plugged into a mathematical algorithm and output a specific string. You can see the two strings above. This is something you should all get into the habit of doing when possible is verifying the checksum of your files. If you remember when we talked about signature files and PGP, this is another method of verifying your downloads but not as good as the signature files. It should however, whenever provided be performed to verify your downloads when the signature file + PGP combination is not available.     Once you have downloaded the file in Tails, the first thing you should do, is move the file you downloaded to your tmp folder. In order to do this, look up at the top and click  Places -> Computer -> File System -> tmp. This is where you move the file your downloaded to, and to keep things easier, rename the file  grugq.zip and you will see why you want to do that in a second.      Next we are going to open a terminal window (like a DOS prompt) by clicking the black rectangle icon in the upper left center area of Tails. Once you have opened your terminal window, we are going to perform some Linux commands.    cd /tmp - This will change the current directory you are operating within the terminal to your tmp folder and allow you to more easily access the files in that folder.   sha1sum grugq.zip - This will perform a SHA1 checksum on the file you just downloaded, and you can see why you wanted to rename the file. It should give you the same output as the SHA1 sum listed above.    md5sum grugq.zip - This will perform an MD5 checksum on the file you just downloaded, and is another way of checking the file. SHA1 is better because it is harder produce the same output twice with different file contents using SHA1 versus MD5, but nonetheless, use both whenever possible and always check your downloaded files.     Ok, assuming your downloaded video passed the checksum test, you can be assured that the video file that I uploaded has not been tampered with, or had any malicious code injected into it. When even a single character is changed in the source code of a given file, the checksum output will be completely different. Most people think it may be off by a a few characters, but the difference is always quite large and is why performing checksums is an important way of verifying your downloads.      Since you now have a 1 hour video presentation that you all need to watch and rewatch (You can do this in Tails), I will end this post and continue with my next post from the assumption that you can completed watching this highly recommended and endorsed (by SR administrators and moderators) video on OpSec. We will start looking more into the recommendations from the Grugq.

This company describes itself as ""the most secure, easy to use communication system"", and many Silk Road users have adopted it. But there are some things you should be aware of.      So, the first time to note is that the FBI is already aware of Safe-Mail.net and is already receiving court orders from non-Israeli law enforcement agencies. And they are likely giving them everything they need in order to read the emails. Therefore, you should remember that no email service should be trusted. No email service is going to go to jail for you. And if you are sending anything sensitive over email using plain text, it will likely be read eventually by somebody other than the intended recipients. This is why things such as strong PGP encryption are essential to any type of sensitive communication.     With this, it should be noted that Safe-Mail is no safer than Gmail when it comes to protecting your privacy with its centralized email service. Never trust any company with your privacy, always encrypt.","Known users of the Safe-mail web service include operators, vendors and customers of the dark webs many drug market sites, journalists writing about the investigation into Silk Road, and BTCKing, the vendor who ran an underground anonymous Bitcoin exchange and allegedly worked with BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem to sell more than $1 million worth of Bitcoins to users of Silk Road.When I reached out to Safe-mail for comment, Amiram Ofir, Safe-mails President and CEO, responded in an email that the company and its employees certainly are not aware of any criminal activity, adding that the company does follow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court. Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities. Its worth noting, however, that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. in 1998. An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server, according to the criminal complaint of Sept. 27, 2013.Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected, and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user-specific keys. When asked if Safe-mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non-Israeli law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, Ofir replied with a short Yes. My followup email, asking if Safe-mail has the ability to decrypt information without a users key, went unanswered."

The threat of being ripped off or scammed on LocalBitcoin is a very real threat. One that you need to be aware of.     I want to share a few stories with you.      Remember, the risk of something like the above happening increases with the amount of Bitcoin being traded for FIAT currency (Government paper or electronic currency). So if you are trying to unload a few Bitcoins to a seller, you may find yourself in a similar situation from time to time and it is best to prepare yourself in case this happen. Bring a friend with you, have them wait at the door in case the person tries to run away, or better yet, multiple friends. If you live in a country or state where it is legal to carry a concealed weapon, then you might want to consider doing this as well.       So, another recommendation if you are dealing with cash often is to get yourself some currency detection pens and a black light to check the bills for hidden logos. A quick search online will give you an idea of what to look for in the currency your country uses. Here is one more story about counterfeit money.      If this is not enough to make you feel a bit uncomfortable, then you need to read them again. But what you can do is simply learn how to inspect bills for authenticity. Again, get yourself a handheld black light, a currency marker and anything else that applies to your country's currency and you can likely protect yourself against this. If the person buying the Bitcoins off of you seems nervous, or like they are in a hurry to get away, then take greater caution with this buyer. Always try to find buyers with good feedback (although this is not perfect), possibly ask for ID if you would feel more comfortable, and bring a friend with you, but do not make it obvious that you brought a friend with you. Getting scammed, robbed or ripped off sucks, and you need to do whatever you can to avoid it happening to you. ","Going to keep it short and simple. I live in a major metropolitan city, and do a lot of business of craigslist. Meet in person, public location, inspect the item, hand cash and be on my way. I'm sure I have 25+ transactions, never been scammed.Today, I saw someone include just as a footnote ""I also accept bitcoins"". Not ""I only accept bitcoins"" or ""plz send bitcoins i mail"" just a little footnote that they are fine with it.Contacted, mentioned purchasing in cash, that was fine, and at the end decided to do it in bitcoins. Brought my laptop, public wifi, took a seat at a McDonalds. Inspected the headphones - Perfect condition, as described, everything was looking good.He hands me a paper cutout with a wallet address, I key it into blockchain, he is looking at the address on screen. I confirm the price (80 USD, was .8xxbtc), he says good, I hit send, the little blockchain beep plays over the speakers.He casually stands up, has the headphones, and walks away. I stand up pretty quick, and shout after to him, accusing him of theft. He says a quick comment around the lines of ""If you can't pay the price don't waste my time, I said $80"" and walks out.I contemplate chasing after him, calling the police, or fuck maybe getting some public attention, then I realized I didn't have a leg to stand on.Cameras would show a guy sitting down at a table, showing me headphones, me inspecting them, then playing on a computer for a bit, with him walking off. I attempt to accuse him of theft, he probably didn't even have $80 in his wallet, nothing would show me handing him cash, and the worst part, as I sat there with a mixture of adrenaline, rage and frustration - is that It was impossible for me to get that money back.Can you imagine trying to talk to the police about this? So yeah officer, I sent him bitcoins, a virtually currency for this craigslist transaction, and then he walks off - Sir, do you have any proof of this? Well, he gave me this address of random letters, but I swear it's his, but it isn't there anymore, it's gone to a mixing service where it gets pu-You get the point. I have a decently hard time explaining bitcoins to my eager, willing to learn friends. I can't imagine trying to explain it to an officer who thinks I just tried to give someone WoW gold for headphones.So, is there any safety precaution out there I didn't take, or should you just keep BTC and Craigslist as far apart as possible?Thanks for reading the rant. Sorry for the wall of text. I guess I just kinda needed to get it out there.http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b89wm/i_just_got_robbed_blind_of_bitcoins_in_person_im/;   A dangerous new scamming trend? £15,000 too closeSo it appears that unfortunately scammers have changed their tactics. I have been advised by police not to disclose the username or details of the person concerned until their investigation is complete but I am ok to disclose the story as a warning to others. Today I went to meet a buyer who was looking for £15,000 worth of bitcoins and wanted to pay in cash but this particular user had a good buyer history so although cautious I agreed to meet him in London in a place I knew there would be CCTV and security for my own safety. Arriving there today in a public place, all went fine initially from chatting with him but when I pulled out a quick form to comply with AML's he seemed very uncomfortable which although I didn't show it, it sent alarm bells ringing in my head as he kind of covered his ID whilst in terrible handwriting filled out the form and done a completely unreadable signature looking nothing like the name. At this point, I was very tempted to call the deal off simply because my gut instinct was really telling me to back out of this but he brought up he had to withdraw another £200 from his bank and so I asked him what bank he was with, which was Nationwide, which I am too, so I went with him to the branch with the cash and forms etc in my bag and said I would just sit in the branch since it had air conditioning and was only 5 stores away. In my head at this point, I was trying to get into the branch and see if I could overhear the name he was withdrawing from and also to see if he actually owned the card he had in his hand so I could match the details up with what was on the form.Upon arrival at the branch, he handed his card over and the bank teller gave everything a quick glance and asked him for further ID and a security check so whilst he done that, I thought I would ask the teller next to him who was free if they could put it on their cash counting machine and showed all the relevant documentation. The cash went behind the counter when she agreed and put it straight on the machine without even looking at the documents surprisingly. Immediately as this happened, the male buying the bitcoins said to me What are you doing? looking terrified and visibly sweating and shaking and I was absolutely certain something was very wrong at this point and before I could turn to the cashier and ask her to keep hold of the documents & cash and call security and the police for me (I was planning to write it on the piece of paper in my hand to be subtle), I heard a loud beeping sound from behind the desk which was the cash machine, rejecting every note in the pile because they were counterfeit notes, £15,000 worth of them. As you can imagine, we had 3 security guards onto us in seconds and police arrived only 2 minutes later and as myself and the other male sat there in handcuffs, the police began to ask questions to me and the other male was taken into another room inside the branch.Fortunately this day I had my CSV dumps of recent transactions, a letter from my HMRC communications recently as per my other post and also a bank statement to verify the recent transactions, plus copies of the emails I had exchanged with the male concerned as I bring them to every meeting in my bag for reference purposes if anything arises. Soon enough, having went back to the original place we met and reviewing CCTV footage of the whole thing, I was released but they kept everything in my bag, all the money of course and frozen my accounts whilst they investigate which I complied with voluntarily. The male who passed the counterfeit notes has been taken to the police station and will be in court tomorrow and I was advised by the Inspector he will probably be referred to the crown court on the matter and is being held in custody until his trial.The bank and police were both present for this and the bank strongly recommended I be careful in future and transactions that large can be run through the bank if need be and they can be the third party to sign it and check everything out for £35, which will completely cover me for the AML's over £10,000 and the buyer doesn't need to go on the bank records but the bank will verify the ID is real for me in some branches too. Whilst I was there I also was given a 10 pack of pens to check notes with for future deals and police have asked me to cease trading until this case is resolved and be prepared to be asked to come to court to present testimony if required.Again I can't name and shame the individual due to a police request, but for what it is worth, that is the story and lesson I have learned from today and despite the many big deals I have done in the past and the many shady characters, this one has really rattled me up.https://localbitcoins.com/forums/#!/regional/uk#a-dangerous-new-scamming-tr;I occasionally trade bitcoins via localbitcoins.com, to ensure that I have a good feel for the liquidity of the market and the ability to exit at will. I've never had any problems before.Last week, I responded to a request to buy $500 worth of bitcoin, via a local buyer here in San Francisco.Nothing unusual about the meet, or the buyer, other than the fact that he wanted to find a contact for regular and higher amount buys. I think he was trying to get me to increase the amount.Anyhow, I had funded $500 in bitcoins, in escrow with localbitcoins.com and we sat down to do the trade. He gave me 25 x $20 bills, which I counted. The bills felt a bit stiff, like brand new bills from an ATM. I looked at them carefully (or so I thought) and they seemed real. I pocketed the money and moved on.Fast forward three days later, I go out with a friend. Just before leaving the house, I grab a few $20s and put them in my wallet. At the first bar I paid for a drink, the bartender cam running out 5 min later into the bar area to find me. He showed me the bill I had given him, said ""this is fake, it fell apart when it got wet"". True enough, the bill had not held up to water like a normal bill. I showed him the other money I had on me and he confirmed it was all fake, except for one $20 I had from before. So I paid for my drink with the real money and left.For those wondering, the bills are indistinguishable from real $20s unless you know exactly what to look for. The smell and texture are slightly off. The most important clue is that the iridescent ""20"" on the side that changes from red-green to black-green depending on the angle you look at it. On the fake bills it does not change color.For my next bitcoin sale, I will be carrying a UV light and pen and will be more careful in scrutiny of the bills. As always, I will only meet in public and I am never unarmed, but now I also have counterfeit detection gear.Seller Beware - Counterfeit money being passed to bitcoin sellers in San FranciscoEdit: I will be writing an article about this for letstalkbitcoin.com and will provide links to detection tips and products to help with detection. Will also provide a more detailed story and pictures of the notes. Standby a few days for that...Edit 2: I will be reviewing the following products against these counterfeit notes, in an upcoming article for letstalkbitcoin.com:    Dri-mark and sharpie brand pens    UV light + magnifying combos    Magnetic testershttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nj88k/i_was_given_counterfeit_20_bills_in_exchange_for/"
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:17:16","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Here is a simple copy and paste story you should be aware of.   As you can see, the cops are watching LocalBitcoins. Laundering Bitcoins is like laundering real money. You need to have a way to justify where the money came from. Back in the day, the Mafia had small legitimate businesses it would run that it could claim as an income, and they might fix the numbers a bit and say they made more money than they really did. This would provide an income they could use as a reason for having money. If you are somebody who does not work, and only sell drugs on Silk Road, and are trying to cash out your coins, then I hope you have a legitimate reason for holding that many BItcoins, otherwise you could end up like these two guys. ","State authorities in Florida on Thursday announced criminal charges targeting three men who allegedly ran illegal businesses moving large amounts of cash in and out of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.Working in conjunction with the Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorneys office, undercover officers and agents from the U.S. Secret Services Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via localbitcoins.com, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed Michelhack. According to this users profile, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in todays value), and a 99 percent positive feedback score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to 30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Floridas law against unlicensed money transmitters  which prohibits currency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period  and Floridas anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is Pascal Reid, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone  which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.The biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because its always hard to buy Bitcoins, Weaver said. The reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible  namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.One very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins  BitInstant  was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.Its still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhacks profile suggests little more than arbitrage  that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But its notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation  28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola  is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. Id expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets, such as Silk Road, Weaver said. If you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.News of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht  the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions  a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer.https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/"
"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:19:14","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security","    The main benefit to this option is that the proxies are run by many people all over the world. They are run when random internet users visit a webpage with a specific plugin that turns their browser into a proxy as long as they are on that page. You are basically using somebody else's connection through their browser to connect to a tor relay. You are only using 1 active connection at any time, but you have around 5 established connections to different proxies in case your active connection drops off, then you can start using another proxy in its place. Below is another explanation of how this process works.      I know this might be a bit complicated, but you really do not need to understand how it works to benefit from it. You also might be asking about somebody just blocking your ability to connect with the facilitator (the supplier of the proxies). But, the way you actually connect to the facilitator is in a very special way that tor has designed, and this is built into the flash proxy pluggable transport. This explanation is just for your comfort, not to help you make it work.      Two questions you should be asking. 1) Can I trust the proxies, and/or facilitator? 2) How do I use this?     Well, the facilitator is chosen and currently only run by tor, so you can take that at face value. As far as the proxies go, the proxies themselves may or may not be trustworthy, and this is the risk you run every time you use tor. Your bridges that you use may be compromised, your entry nodes, your exit nodes, every single possible hop along your way to the internet can be compromised at any given time. Luckily, even if the proxy is compromised and logging your traffic, they are only going to be able to see encrypted tor traffic. And as I mentioned above, anybody who visits a webpage with a specific plugin on it, becomes a flash proxy as long as they are on that site. This means, some people will be a flash proxy without their knowledge, and others will be flash proxies because they want to be one. The idea behind this is to have multiple users, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of flash proxies available at all times to increase the number of possible IP addresses you rotate between to keep your ISP and possibly the NSA guessing.     So do you use this?  It actually currently is not supported in Tails. But it can be used with Tor Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle outside of Tails. You can get it at the following page and it will run on your normal operating system, whether it is Windows, MAC, or Linux. Get the package at the following page.  https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en#download     Next follow the following tutorial, which is pretty straight forward and has pictures of exactly what you need to do, and will probably do a better job than I would at explaining how to set it up.  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto     Essentially it comes down to, enable port forwarding for port 9000, add ""bridge flashproxy 0.0.1.0:1"" without the quotes, to your torrc, and leave everything else alone unless you need to use a different port, which is unlikely. You may need to make an exception in your firewall for the flashproxy plugin if it asks you. As long as you are using the Tor Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle, it should be pretty easy to get this feature working. But until Tails adds support for it, this is the only option you have if you want to use flash proxy bridges.      Ok, so you have a lot of information right now and maybe are left a bit confused, but read over this one a few times and try to extract as much out of it as possible at once. Try setting up normal bridges, then try doing the obfuscated bridges, and once you get those working, then maybe consider doing the flash proxies if you are okay without using Tails. Tails will likely implement support for this later. Ask yourself some questions, do I just want to hide the fact that I am using tor from my ISP? Or am I hiding from somebody much bigger than that?      Consider whether it is plausible for you to run a private obfuscated proxy, or even a private bridge. Hopefully now you have enough information to make an informed decision.     Currently there are other pluggable transports currently under developed, but not yet deployed. Here is a list of upcoming projects.   ","In addition to the Tor client and relay, we provide three new pieces. The Tor client contacts the facilitator to advertise that it needs a connection (proxy). The facilitator is responsible for keeping track of clients and proxies, and assigning one to another. The flash proxy polls the facilitator for client registrations, then begins a connection to the client when it gets one. The transport plugins on the client and relay broker the connection between WebSockets and plain TCP. (Diagram below)   https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/arch.png A sample session may go like this:    1. The client starts Tor and the client transport plugin program (flashproxy-client), and sends a registration to the facilitator using a secure rendezvous. The client transport plugin begins listening for a remote connection.    2. A flash proxy comes online and polls the facilitator.    3. The facilitator returns a client registration, informing the flash proxy where to connect.    4. The proxy makes an outgoing connection to the client, which is received by the client's transport plugin.    5. The proxy makes an outgoing connection to the transport plugin on the Tor relay. The proxy begins sending and receiving data between the client and relay.In other words, you end up going from your computer, to the proxy, then the proxy to the tor relay. - JRThe whole reason this is necessary is because the client cannot communicate directly with the relay. (Perhaps the censor has enumerated all the relays and blocked them by IP address.) In the above diagram, there are two arrows that cross the censor boundary; here is why we think they are justified. The initial connection from the client to the facilitator (the client registration) is a very low-bandwidth, write-only communication that ideally may happen only once during a session. A careful, slow, specialized rendezvous protocol can provide this initial communication. The connection from the flash proxy to the client is from an IP address the censor has never seen before. If it is blocked within a few minutes, that's fine; it wasn't expected to run forever anyway, and there are other proxies lined up and waiting to provide service.;The way the client registers with the facilitator, is a special rendezvous step that does not communicate directly with the facilitator, designed to be covert and very hard to block. The way this works in practice is that the flash proxy client transport plugin makes a TLS (HTTPS) connection to Gmail, and sends an encrypted email from an anonymous address (nobody@localhost) to a special facilitator registration address. The facilitator checks this mailbox periodically, decrypts the messages, and inserts the registrations they contain. The result is that anyone who can send email to a Gmail address can do rendezvous, even if the facilitator is blocked.https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyFAQ;ScrambleSuit is a pluggable transport that protects against follow-up probing attacks and is also capable of changing its network fingerprint (packet length distribution, inter-arrival times, etc.). It's part of the Obfsproxy framework. See its official page.

I had all of my most recent files, including a few new Bitcoin wallets with balances on them on my main portable drive, and on top of it, this drive was encrypted.      Then, without warning, I suddenly received an error that the file system was corrupted and my disk could not be read. No matter, if you have an unencrypted drive, you can simply run a data recovery program such as  testdisk. Open up your terminal and type the following. Make sure you started Tails with a login at the boot up when it asks you.   sudo apt-get install testdisk     Using this program (follow documentation online) you can likely recover most of your files because it ignores file system headers and other types of file organization required to identify the way the files are stored. There are many other programs as well. The problem in my case, was that all my files were encrypted. This means, that in order to decrypt the files, I needed a key file that is stored on the drive to unlock my files. If this key file gets damaged, then even if you have the password for your files, you will not be recovering your files.     The key is unique to that particular instance when you encrypted the drive. Meaning that even if I tried to recreate the key file with the same password, the result would be a different key file. This means essentially that my data is unrecoverable, because my key file was somehow corrupted. Technology is delicate, data is stored in the form of magnetic frequencies and there is no guarantee that files will not become corrupted one day for seemingly no reason. Here are some things that could ruin your data.  Flood, hurricane, power surge, fire, moisture damage, accidentally stepping on your drive, a family member (usually a child) breaks it, you lose it, spill water on it, over heats, and so forth.     All of these could result in your data or drive getting damaged and losing all of your data. This is why you need a minimum of 2 backups. Not 1, but 2. And have one of your backups preferrably stored outside of your home. If you work, store one at work, or in your car, or somewhere you can access regularly, and try to back up your data as often as possible. If your house burns down and you kept all your backups at home, then you lose everything. If you kept a copy at work, then you can recover it. The more backups the better, as long as they are encrpypted. Any time you create a new wallet and transfer Bitcoin into it, back it up. Any time you set up a new account or a new email with a unique password (which should be every time), back it up. You need to be backing up everything.      Luckily for myself my main wallet was recoverable with the majority of my coins, but I did lose some coins, which can never be recovered, trust me, I tried. Getting extra USB drives or SD cards are very cheap and inexpensive, so you owe it to yourself to spend a few extra dollars to have multiple backups just in case you wind up in my situation where you had not backed up your drive in a couple of weeks and end up losing data that could cost you a lot more than what it would have costed to have a few extra drives laying around as back ups.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","earth","2107.0","2015-06-04T13:53:13","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Support/Security"," Yes, you read the title correctly. Using the same types of techniques taught in this thread, you can and should remain anonymous no matter what you are doing.      Pedophiles and child pornographers are some of the most wanted people on the planet. They are up there with terrorists and serial killers. They are hunted by federal law enforcement agencies, and punished very seriously, as they should. So the reason for this post is to demonstrate, that if somebody who is as wanted as much as pedophiles and child pornographers can remain free by using proper OpSec, then you can too.       I want to talk to you about a group of child pornographers that operated for several years online, called YardBird. During a period of 15 months, there were around 400,000 images and 11,000 videos uploaded to a central server run by the group and shared by the members. The reason we know that, is because during that 15 months, the FBI performed an undercover operation to infiltrate the group in hopes of apprehending the members. They successfully apprehended 1 in 3 members of the group. One of those who remain free to date, was the leader of the group, who also went by the online name YardBird.      How is it possible that after so much effort was put in by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Queensland Police Service, that people high up on the wanted lists were able to evade capture. They used strong cryptography, and proper OpSec rules. Let us now talk about the history of the attempted apprehension of this group.     According to the FBI.      As I said earlier, the alleged leader of this ring used the online name ""Yardbird"". Yardbird made a re-appearance on Usenet in both 2009 and 2010 on the date corresponding to the first and second anniversaries of the busts in 2008. His intent was to show that he was still free, and to answer people's questions.      One of the most important things Yardbird stated were that everyone in the group who used Tor and remailers remained free, while those who relied on services such as Privacy.LI were arrested and convicted. Privacy.li is an offshore VPN service that promises anonymity. They claim from their website the following.      And their privacy policy makes the following promise.         Yardbird further commented that several members of the group, including his second-in-command Christopher Stubbings (Helen) and Gary Lakey (Eggplant) were Privacy.LI users -- in fact he stated that they used it for everything. (Helen is currently serving a 25-year sentence in the UK, while Eggplant is serving life in an Arizona prison.)     Eggplant literally became notorious because of his constant promotion of Privacy.LI -- he continually boasted that he could not be caught because Privacy.LI did not keep logs, and they were located outside of U.S. jurisdiction.       At the end of the day, no service provider is going to go to jail for you. A simple court order can get even the toughest VPN providers to roll over on their users, because they would rather betray a $20 per month user than be fined, shut down and possibly thrown in jail for interfering with a federal investigation.      What other mistakes were made to lead to the arrest of some members of this group? The Australian police arrested a man on totally unrelated child pornography charges, and presumably as part of a plea deal, he revealed the  existence of 'the group' and handed over a PGP public/private keypair and password. Having acquired from the informer the current group PGP public/private keypair, and its passphrase meant that the police could assume this group member's identity, and furthermore, read all the encrypted traffic posted by members of the group.    So it is important to note at this time, that you no matter how comfortable you become with somebody, there is always a chance that they can become compromised. In fact, the group has a set of rules, that all members were told to abide by, and if any member was found to be breaking the following rules, they would be expelled.   The ones who got caught, were the ones who did not follow the rules by putting too much trust in their online ""friends"". We saw this in the arrest of Sabu when he helped the FBI bust his ""friends"" in LulzSec. If someone is given a deal to cut the amount of time spent in prison in half, they likely will take the deal at your expense. Below is an example of a plea versus trying to fight the charges in this exact case.      13-30 years versus life in prison, may entice even some of the hardest criminals, and if you think your online ""friend"" who you have never met in person is going to keep their mouth shut to keep you out of jail, you are in for a big surprise.      So, as you can see, the group was pretty much an open book to the police. They were completely and thoroughly penetrated. Despite that, however, the  majority of the group were still able to remain at large, and were neither positively identified nor arrested. This is due to the privacy tools (pgp, tor, nymservers, remailers) that were employed. Even with everything else being an open book, those using these tools still managed to evade capture. But you may be saying, Ok, I understand PGP, I understand tor, but what the heck is a nymserver and a remailer?      In a nutshell, an anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages (in this case an email) with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from. A nymserver also referred to as a pseudonymous remailer assigns its users a user name, and it keeps a database of instructions on how to return messages to the real user. These instructions usually involve the anonymous remailer network itself, thus protecting the true identity of the user.        Some of the advantages of using these services are to protect the intended recipient from an adversary, and also protect the sender of the message. Some of these services use what is called a common mailbox, in which all messages are stored in a central mail box with no ""To and From"" headers. It is up to the users who use the service to attempt to use their PGP keys to try and decrypt all of the messages stored in the central message box and see if they can decrypt any of them. If they can, this message is intended for them. This way it rules out again, the sender and receiver. This system of remailers, can also form a chain, in which the message is bounced off of multiple remailers before making it to its intended reicipient to widen the gap between the sender and receiver.     Another effective option some services offer is the ability to delay when the message gets sent on to the next server in the chain, or the recipient itself. If you are found to be sending out PGP encrypted traffic through some type of analysis at 5:00PM, and another person being monitored receives it at 5:01PM, it is easier to correlate that this message may be from you to the other person being monitored. At this time I have no recommendations for service to use, but I am likely to post about them in the future. In the meantime, let us get back to the ring of pedophiles shall we?      To summarize. We have seen that even the most hunted criminals, can evade capture when using strong cryptography and proper OpSec. The ring leader of one of the most investigated child pornography rings still remains at large today because those who followed the rules. ","If your secure communications platform isnt being used by terrorists and pedophiles, youre probably doing it wrong.http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-usenet-tradecraft/;There were approximately 60 members that were loosely identified, and from the 60, approximately 20 were positively identified in this group.There were numerous challenges presented during Operation Achilles. The group utilized an unprecedented level of organization and sophistication. They had a timed test for prospective new members. They had to use encryption technology and Internet-based anonymizers, re-mailing services. They also intentionally corrupted their own child pornography files and only the new members knew how to reconfigure those files to be able to read the pictures or the video. They also had the uncanny ability to monitor worldwide news pertaining to law enforcement efforts in child pornography matters in order to better educate themselves to avoid law enforcement detection.https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside/operation-achilles.mp3/view; If you need corporate and/or military strength encrypted networks, then a Virtual Private Network is the way to go. All and any traffic from and to your desktop are within an encrypted tunnel, and your originating IP-address is well concealed.http://www.privacy.li/services.html;Yes, we 101% honor your privacy, no logs, no snooping, no profiling. No legal mumbo-jumbo to disguise any hidden efforts. We believe in individualism and privacy, even anonymity.http://www.privacy.li/privacy-policy.html;I pointed out to anyone who would listen that services such as Privacy.LI were for /privacy/ -- not for anonymity. In an ideal situation, one needs both to be private as well as anonymous. Essentially, what Privacy.LI supplied was a type of VPN service, providing an encrypted tunnel for data to travel between two endpoints--the customer's computer being one endpoint, while the Privacy.LI servers provided the other. While there was a degree of privacy, there was NO anonymity at all--so it really didn't come as a  surprise that Privacy.LI's customers were among those arrested.http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html;Once the group was penetrated, the police were able to take advantage of a few factors: 1) They had the informant's computer, with all its email, PGP keys and the    like. This provided a history, which made it easier to continue the    impersonation.    2) By the time it was penetrated, the group had been operating for about 5    years. By this time, the group had jelled into a community -- people were    familiar with each other, they often let their guards down, and would    sometimes reveal tidbits of personal information. This is especially the    case when they thought their messages were secure, and beyond the ability    of the police to intercept--they would say things that they would *never*   say in the open. http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html;    Never reveal true identity to another member of the group    Never communicate with another member of the group outside the usenet channel    Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet        No member can positively identify another    Members do not reveal personally identifying information    Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly        If a member violates a security rule, e.g. fails to encrypt a message        Periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery    On each newsgroup migration        Create new PGP key pair, unlinking from previous messages        Each member creates a new nickname            Nickname theme selected by Yardbirdhttp://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-usenet-tradecraft/;...seven of the U.S. subjects pleaded guilty pre-trial to a 40-count indictment and received federal sentences ranging from 13-30 years in prison. The remaining seven defendants opted for a joint, simultaneous trial. All seven were convicted by a jury and subsequently sentenced to life in prison.https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside/operation-achilles.mp3/view;Leaving aside my personal feelings about pedophiles, I brought up this case as an example for several reasons: 1) Child pornography is a serious crime in virtually every jurisdiction.    As this example demonstrates, police will work together, even across    national boundaries, to investigate these crimes. They are willing    to invest considerable time, manpower and money in pursuit of these    suspects. The only other crimes which usually merit this type of    approach are drug/gun-running or terrorism. The level of effort    expended in pursuing this group can be seen in that even FBI    executive assistant director J. Stephen Tidwell was involved.       Normally one would not expect FBI personnel that highly placed    to be involved -- this shows the level of importance placed on    this particular investigation. (A year or so after the busts,    Yardbird himself expressed astonishment that the FBI would    consider his group such a priority.)       2) This case is the only one that I'm aware of, where suspects were    using sophisticated tools like PGP, Tor, anonymous remailers and    nymservers. 3) This case underscores the effectiveness of these tools even against    well-funded, powerful opponents like the FBI, Europol, and Interpol.    (N.B.: FWIW, those who were caught used either inappropriate and/or    ineffective tools and techniques to protect themselves.    4) I fully understand most people's disgust at the types of crimes/   criminals being discussed here. That said, it is important to    remember that one simply cannot design a system that provides    protection for one class of people, but denies it for another.    You can't, for example, deploy a system that provides privacy/   anonymity for political dissidents, or whistle blowers, and yet    denies it to pedophiles -- either *everyone* is safe, or NO ONE    is safe. This may not be palatable, but these are the facts.http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html"

As the title says, how can I get out of a ""thinking"" loop, during a LSD trip? I'm really new to psychedelics and have only tried LSD twice (I am 18 years young). Both times resulteted in a ""thinking"" loop. Below a bit more about those two experiences.  The LSD I was using both the times were the WOW (100mcg) tabs by GammaGoblin. My first time with LSD, I was using exactly one of those WOW tabs. I'm pretty sure my setting wasn't perfect. I did it alone, at 7pm in my room and had to go to Uni the next day. I was pretty nervous, because this was going to be my first time trying out LSD, but I didn't feel uncomfortable. I took the tab at 7pm and could feel my head getting ""warmer"" at like 7.45pm and had the first OEV's at pretty exactly 8pm. The time went by really fast and everything was good. I was texting with a good friend of mine and just felt really happy. During the entire time I was fascinated by the OEV's and totally overwhelmed, in a positive way. Time went by really really fast and I easily got lost in thoughts and just looking around, still in a positive way.   At the 4 hour mark it took a turn though. That was the moment I realized I had to get up early the next day and wanted to start sleeping. I closed my eyes but couldn't stop thinking, I saw comic like pop ups and everything was just moving and more of those comic like pop ups popped up). I tried to make it stop and, if you could call it that. That's when I started to get in the thought loop. It's really hard to explain what the loop feels like. It's just there and you catch yourself always thinking the same things over and over again. Once in the thought loop I tried to stop/fight it, but it just didn't stop.  The same happened exactly yesterday, same setting, just not as nervous. Instead of a full 100mcg tab, I cut it in a half and took it, this time at 8pm. Around 4 hours in I again started getting caught in a thought loop, but this time I didn't have any plans for the next day. My moot just entirely ""turned down"". The only difference was that I only had really really light OEV's, slim to none.   Please help me to enjoy this substance as much as you guys do!",""

Now normally you can remember the content of the previous loops. On DMT+LSD, I realized I could only remember 1 previous loop. We used a stop watch, and at the very peak, each loop was 15 seconds. So I had to gradually add more data to the loops till I could build back a full consciousness. I had to manually carry over more and more data, because I could not remember anything past 30 seconds.

In your case seeking out a local mentor or group more experienced might be helpful. You should have done this before well in advance of getting the substance. These chemicals can be tricky to a newbie and are confusing at times. Psychedelics are a class of substances best learned with others to guide you. You should not just buy and try something because you think it is fun. Take the time to prepare yourself more. If you got product from GG you must have done some reading. Posting here with questions was a good step but could have been sooner.  Once you get experience tripping being alone with your thoughts becomes more comfortable and you can better predict your reactions. That includes thoughts we may not often encounter such as logic (thought) loops. Having people share the experience can ground you especially if the people involved have similar view points. Be selective who you trip with, do not trip with someone just because they want to. Negative people or people with a personality type you find irritating can cause you to have a bad trip.

FEEL FREE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT (like laying on the grass or something that can appear weird to some people you won't near you during an acid trip), don't be in a set/setting too much formal.

I haven't really tried that, but have tried eating cannabis edibles, CBD-tinctures, once tried to wind down the trip by taking some kratom.  A filling healthy meal and some good herb tends to make me feel quite peaceful.    Simply 'realizing you have to get up tomorrow' does not exactly make the LSD stop coursing through your mind, body, spirit.. and when I (ahem) was your age, I had to deal with a bit of that -awesome trip - then - d'ohh reality hits ya as you remember work or college or tomorrow's various responsibilites and it can be hard to stay positive or relax sometimes.  Some of my suggestions would include:   Set and setting:  As you may know, a trip needs a good set and setting, like both a good setting 'ahh, my cozy den, with my delicious bassy music and numerous ways to consume cannabis or what-have-you..some good snacks / food / drink..some good music relatively easy to locate.. (or a great nature setting, rave, tree-house-building, laying in a deprivation chamber, or whatever floats your boat lol)' - okay so you have chosen a good setting, now is the rest of your checklist checked off for going in with the right 'set'..?  I think this means like mindset, intentions, state of mind/emotions/life-situations, and I think in this case the fact that you had to do something the next day was what began the loop right?  So if you had nothing to do the next day, would you have only remained positive? Oh, I see you answered my question, you didn't have plans the second time.   Okay well a cheeky yet semi-serious suggestion, is have you tried raising your dosage? I know a new LSD user may protest the notion, but I have over the years slowly gleaned from reading countless trip reports and threads about dosages and stuff that some of these substances seem easier at higher doses.. well in this one thread, the topic was 'how much LSD for first trip?'  Well, the standard answer was 'oh, about 100mics.'  But then all these other folks started showin up in the discussion with opinions like this one that seems to have struck a chord with me:  they said something like 'actually, I get more adverse effects at the -low doses- and while at higher doses I feel the trip just carries itself and it's more lucid and amazing and 'like I hope LSD will be when I take it..'  As well someone else said something along the lines of ""We cant get people all used to 100 mics like this-is-the-whole-story and then one day they take 250 mics and are all freaking out inn such a new and potent headspace.."" (kinda makes sense) You may have heard of other substances that do this too, at lower doses there are uncomfortabilities that believe it or not, are less at a -higher dose-, even though it might seem like an odd idea.  (and those challenges at low doses may turn them off from trying higher doses..   Well that brings me to my next thought I wanted to share:  Over the years, if you keep doing such substances, your relationship with it will likely evolve.  I've had all kinds of good, and 'bad trips' when I was first starting out, and maybe loopy hours like you described. I've even had trips that turned me off from the stuff and I was like, this isn't resonating with me, I think I'm done.  Now years later I seem to more prefer LSD (and mescaline, ayahuasca, changa, and others) to magic mushrooms, even if it may feel in its own way, 'less natural' -- mushrooms just reaallly trip me out these days, and I rarely do them.  I used to really love a good mushroom trip, but may have gleaned all the knowledge and experiences possible from them.  When used right, I find LSD realy lucid and sparkly and progressive (and always more to learn/experience) and I move through a bunch of things and emerge a grinning 'victor', and then find more aspects of my life, home, psyche, relationships, family, work, hobbies etc, to liberate or make better and then am victorious again.. hehe - or even if you realize you seemingly failed in a situation, you see all these crucial lessons that came out of it and so on.. and so see it in a different light.    So I'm saying over time, you may find: A, you can control the energy better if it gets loopy or negative (can always try majorly changing the vibes/setting; music, smells/incense/sage, smoke some organic herbs or changa, go for a walk in nature, make love, invent or heal something; and B, you may take larger doses than what are fairly actually entry-level doses.  A 1/2-tab of 100mic-tabs may be a perfect microdose for some, and for others it might just seem like a tease to the part of you that 'really does' want to get really high/saturated.  Like if I have just one beer, I almost feel restless like I've been teased.  If I have several drinks (which I hardly ever do these days, but used to enjoy it fresh out of high school..) then I feel happy and intoxicated and creative and sociable and like 'on a fun plateau'..  well, eventually I discovered how to fearlessly take a bit more LSD (or mescaline, etc) and not have it get uncomfortable, get to an enjoyable plateau/headspace,  and I see what the folks mean when they say sometimes at lower doses you're not sure if you really like the feeling completely or not.  I no longer have bad trips or loopy thoughts, and well-aware of some ways to personally snap out of it, and really enjoy things like playing musical instruments/jamming while tripping, receiving/giving massage..ahhhh    climbing or hugging trees, listening to my favorite musics or new musics, re-inventing my home space..etc.  I used to clean all night and throw out lots of unneeded trash/baggage and by morning I'd be looking around at this amazing new space, successfully changing it from cluttered typical neglected bedroom to a very peaceful, relaxing  sacred space..and feel like Zen master / Shaman - deluxe; once the space is really nice and inspiring, then whether I am meditating, or tripping,  it is far easier to have a pleasant positive experience, and move thru stuff fluidly without getting stuck in loops.  Oh that reminds me, do you ever meditate or work out do anything to calm your thoughts/mind?  I heard it's good to have a good grounded/quiet/peaceful place-within that you diligently create in your regular life and that then when you are tripping, you can re-align yourSelf with 'your peaceful place you go when you meditate' - obviously sometimes while tripping the thoughts are pouring in at lightspeed but anyways.. I don't meditate much, and so I do end up thinking a lot, and the excessive thinking or 'monkey mind' will continue in-to a trip.   So... what is your Sacred Space like friend?     Is it conducive to positive journies?  I'm not suggesting everyone clean / repair things / re-arrange their home/life while tripping, but I personally sometimes get urges to repair/heal/fix/get-rid-of anything that catches my attention that seems to need a change.  Like a real simple example of good 'feng shui,'  (pronounced like FUNG-shway I believe) is where there was a pile of random clutter in the corner, you got rid of it all and in it's place you put a really nice potted plant.  Now every time you look at that corner, you get a good organic peaceful feeling.    When you walk in to a good-feng-shui office or home or business (or park, etc) you tend to feel light, spacious, and you feel pleased with 'what this person has done with this place.' I reccomend if there's anything needing making-nicer in your Trip Zone, go all out and make it amazing and put a nice crystal or plant or psychedelic poster where there was something less appealing/natural.  Surrounded by plants and crystals and good music, one tends to have an amazing journey.  When I was younger (and had no crystals..still have no plants..sigh) I sometimes just sat in a white apartment and listened to Pink Floyd and stared at my hands like the classic freak... whooaaaaaa... and idly scribble on a piece of paper or walk around town staring at things in awe.  Now I tend to use all the goodies that the universe has given us to help make a really good journey, fairly steer-able (like say..vaporizers..electronic music..instruments..super-foods..incenses..communicatings..nature-walks/camps, shamanic musics/chants or any other cool thing you can think of) - but wait, that leads to one last point: I also heard that the LSD molecule/Spirit doesn't neccesarily 'want to be controlled', or the user only ever take enough to 'remain in control,'  that sometimes ya just gotta get right saturated in the molecule and you may find you then move past the usual parts where you got stuck.  Unless of course you have a very wrong set and setting, state of mind going in, etc, where the tripper may find a stronger dose 'worse' or harder (imagine taking a larger dose than usual, around some folks you aren't really sure of.. now imagine taking it with some favorite close friends / partner in a sunny field on a perfect temperature day.. this is where I'd feel comfortable having that additional tab or two because I'd trust that it's going to be a great and positive experience in this field full of yellow flowers and butterflies and chirping birds and gently-swaying trees..     Okay it's getting late and hope that wasnt a dizzyingly-long answer or straying off topic.  We're trippers here, rambling should be expected at times! And late nights!! hahaha      Blessings on your future journies. May they be more flowing and smooth and positive!  And yunno, ya could always call a shaman/sitter to come over and light special incenses and play special healing songs while you 'feel uncomfortable' and you should start feeling much better, and as then as the band Phish sings, 'When the moment ends..'  well, you move past that loop, ya karate chop it hyaaah! hehe (martial arts dojos/practice-centers are usually good feng shui right?) and maybe with the help of some peaceful music and 'peacefulizing' (a word I made up) incenses, snacks, ideas of what to do if we start stagnating (stagnant = stuck, right?)   Sometimes eating an orange or something that is really luscious and healthy (and colorful?) makes my trip-vibe get all sparkly and better like I came around a psychic corner and am now just enjoying the smoother sailing.  You don't 'try to control' the substance, but you may like to gently guide it if it 'gets off track'..     (I think LSD truly does want to be our friend..and friendly..haha)    And how long did you wait in between trips?  I find if I only wait a few days or a week, it might not be as 'fun and sparkly' as if I waited a couple weeks or months.    And of course.. (we could go on and on!) - there yet the other highly-relevant subject of 'which tabs did you take?' - in this case, it appears you have only tried one variety of LSD, in your..new tripping-life.    I have tried countless kinds and there's still many highly-rated popular varieties I haven't tried! Well, you may discover along the way, the different flavors of LSD's and maybe some may be more think-y and some may be more feel-y and some may have the perfect balance and some may completely blow your mind (no more loops now, my mind is gone..hehe) and you feel reborn the next day, even though so underslept.  Wow I must really love talking about these things.. good luck friend!    Much love, and enjoy the mysteries!    Hope I helped a little with this one.. haha    Morning Light ",""

I've had this problem too, but I think it helps to realize that this is in fact not a problem at all but the very thing you're seeking. My usual approach to this is meditation - to focus on the breath and notice the crazy directions of my thoughts but always bring it back to the breath. There are other ways to achieve a similar effect: in PIT terms you might try finding a different resonant driver to synchronize to, much like the feedback network OotP described. Terence McKenna recommends singing, and I would add dancing. Whatever it is, you have to give yourself over to it; you described struggling against it and that very act is going to produce and amplify feelings of discomfort. Sometimes as simple a change as turning on a light can turn everything around, keeping in mind that everything is fundamentally OK. The psychedelic experience can tend to seize on such subtle aspects of experience and amplify them until they seem to dominate your attention.  Now that you have this experience under your belt you can go into the next one with full confidence that you can handle and integrate anything that might come your way, and that perspective will come to permeate everything.",""

Watch it, the whole thing. Somewhere in there he talks about how many people seem to report that around the 4 hr mark, LSD trips tend to take some kind of a turn, and usually get a bit edgier.   They have done studies on this and they have found that the serotonin and dopamine levels steadily rise together from the beginning of the trip, and at around the 4 hour mark the serotonin levels dramatically start a steady decline whereas the dopamine levels continue to rise.   They suspect that this overabundance of dopamine is what gives rise to the slightly edgier/paranoid state. I have personally witnissed this myself, Im actually considering trying a candyflip, and timing my mdma to kick in at the 4 hour mark to boost my serotonin levels and see what effect this has on that part of the trip, even if its just a small dose.  Regarding your actual question of how to get out of thought loops, I find music helps, or something to take your minds attention away from internalization. Although, sometimes the internalization is the best part depending on if its negative or positive, or even if its negative, can you do something positive with that information after the trip?",""

I'm looking to pick up some DMT and have my first experience with this fascinating compound. Sourcing it shouldn't be too much of an issue, but dosing might be. I'll give some background on why and I would love some input on my potential alternative.  THE PROBLEM: I realized the harm I was causing myself with nonstop marijuana use over a year ago while tripping, and don't want to go back to it. I know it can be smoked on other plants, but I don't smoke anything anymore. And vapor genies are a bit pricey, especially when it'd be dedicated solely to a medicine I've never tried.  Proposed Solution: I use rebuildable vaporizers that helped get me off of cigarettes a couple years ago. For those not familiar with vaping; These are basically batteries that when switched, heat up a handwrapped coil of resistance wire. This has liquid with nicotine in/around it thanks to a wicking material passing through the coil that's saturated with juice. This all sits in a chamber with airflow holes on the sides and a mouthpiece on the top.  If I were to wrap a tight coil (with no gaps for the DMT to fall through), sprinkle it with the dose, and pull, wouldn't this effectively vaporize it? My concerns are the proximity of the heat to the dose, similar to not wanting to burn less friendly drugs in glass ""crack"" pipes.   Is there a risk of burning or destroying the DMT, or just having it liquify and fall through the coil? I'm mentally comparing it to a a vapor genie where the screen heats up via a battery with adjustable wattage, or more simplistically, hot-knifing DMT.  tl;dr can I effectively vape dmt in an RDA on my mod?",""

Every Effect of psychedelics are dose dependent though does vary between substances. The mind space and stimulation seem to come earliest followed by CEV, OEV and then further distortions of reality including Ego death. If they are not dose dependent than when you take 300mg you should get the same effect as 700mg only at a lower intensity.    You will get OEVs at low doses but very different experience than a full hallucination at a higher dose. Ego death is the point you become completely overwhelmed to where you essentially cease to exist as a being mentally. Physically probably not functional. If this describes your experience on low doses of psychedelics then would call it Ego death.   Think 500mg of Mescaline would induce some Ego death pretty reliably unless you have a natural tolerance. Could not agree more about gradually increasing dosages, always do this myself.

On next boots you'll be able to get back to your wallet again using this seed.  In electrum you'll see there are addresses where you can receive founds. Give 3 to 5 of them each time you want to send money to the mixer of your choice. If you use only one address (be it your own TOR wallet, agora, a seller..) it's pretty easy for anyone looking on the blockchain to see that there is 1.78 BTC IN and 1.78 BTC (minus 2.5% fee if you use helix for example) OUT from another address. And even if you have plausible deniability you'd be better using more than one address to make your mixing stronger... If you are to pay to remove your coins'taint, then better do it right.  Localbitcoins with cash, cash in the mail or any thing that won't leave tracks back to you > mixer > tor wallet is quite good.   If you need more privacy you could send from mixer 1 to mixer 2 then to BTC wallet but it's probably not needed if you're a small time buyer and you use tor to connect to the tumbler...","Okey thanks. I see folks writing about that u should use 3-5 adresses and mixers to make it most unknown. Do you guys have any advice where I can get an email adress that is safe?"

Maybe the vendor has such poor OPSEC that they do not think they can get compromised and so keep detailed accounts and journals of all actions. Overconfident reckless people tend to fit this demographic.   Some vendors are intelligent enough to be able to source and distribute substances just long enough to get incarcerated (at minimal).

I've tried this in the past with clonazepam in my system and still had pleasant (but significantly muted) trips.

Not surprised you felt like a zombie. Most people use it as needed unless they are having very bad times. If your medical providers think you need this amount maybe tripping will not help.  You will get waves of anxiousness at times even with the best set and setting on LSD. If you cannot handle life without Xanax right now think what a bad anxious trip would be like. The medicine will dull LSD especially with such a low dose unless you are sensitive. I would not want to trip my first time not having the full experience. Underwhelming trips can be disappointing.

When i tried 4mg I simply did not like it, it made me into a zombie, i could not remember what i would do the next day. and no i don't have any mental disorders (not that am I am aware of). I guess my anxiety stems from an existential crisis, honestly. I look at pigeons, or a crow and I start to wish we could trade places. Why you ask? Because sometimes I feel like being a human is too big of a a cross to bear on my back. Sometimes I feel as if those pigeons and crows I look at are more free than me. Why? Because I am human, I am a slave to the dollar, I am just property of the government, a clog in the machine that is oiled with the blood of the innocent. This might be a bit too dramatic but ever since my 5g shroom trip, things just have not been the same for me. Psychedelics once showed me the world in such a wonderful and radiant light, but that 5g trip dragged me to the pits of psychedelic hell, it showed me how ugly everything can get.

That was 2 years ago, my last trip (mescaline) was amazing very powerful, moving and spiritual I dont know how much my friend gave me but it lasted 17 hours and it was simply amazing.

When you start with this shows I am a newbie people will assume you have almost no experience with psychedelics. Difference in responses. It sounds like you have limited experience based on not having done LSD yet. LSD is the representative molecule for psychedelics for comparing all other psychedelics. Would hesitate saying that I know the headspace, the feeling, what to expect about psychedelics, I believe you have a good idea for sure though. Picture you visiting some areas around my fatherland and trying to describe where I grew up based on surrounding areas. You will have an idea but not the whole thing. If you have not tripped more than 15 times over a period of years I would say you are a newbie. Not judging just trying to frame my response to help out. Glad you mentioned that about mushrooms. There is supposedly a sweet spot in terms of anxiety that was researched in the last 3-5 years. With 5g you are within the range for the potential for the trip to go bad at about 50%. Heard this repeated over the years about bad trips from mushrooms at higher dosage but never any evidence.  Do not think this applies to pure psilocybin but not sure.  A search should find the study, think it was survey based. It seems the potential for a bad trip on mescaline is lower overall. I am not very familiar with it but it has more empathogenic effects which I believe buffers this.  I would hesitate to compare LSD with mescaline or mushrooms in terms of potential to have a bad trip. DMT if smoked is way too short even if the intensity is higher. I had to ride out a bad trip once on LSD, the duration was the worst part as I am sure you know.Quote from: 88cutlasssupreme on April 23, 2015, 01:49:47 amThank you for the responses guys, but actually banana jack, the doc recommended 4mg a day. I did that for 2 days and I didn't like it, I was too out of it so I just took it down to 2 mg a day, 1mg in the morning 1mg in the evening. I dont feel like a zombie now, I am fully functional and can speak without slurring.4mg without any previous history is rare. I am glad to hear that was too high a dose for you, it would be for most people. It is odd a medical provider would give 4mg initially with no major daily panic attacks. That dosage is made to get you physically through the day not help you work things out. Your provider must have some evidence to start at such a high dosage. Usually the dosage balance point with a medicine is when the negative effects equal or outway the positive ones. This happens as dosage is increased so best to start low unless there was a reason.Could be you were on other similar medicines, you have mental disorders or medical conditions you are not discussing, you are more anxious then you realize or the medical provider is not that good (it happens).  The average starting dose is .5-1mg daily and then adjusted as needed over weeks usually. You may be thinking in terms of recreational doses that 4mg or even 2mg is not high, medically it is. I do not suggest you put your entire medical record here but if you have a history (including genetic) of mental disorders (especially anything harmful to yourself or others), physical disorders, and heavy recreational drugs use it can affect things. Besides basic things like your gender, ethnicity, age, eating habits, and any other substances you put in your body which can vary how medicine reacts.It sounds like you are going to do it either way. If you feel comfortable I personally think 100ug is safe but have no idea what your specifics are. I find lower dosages of psychedelics can be more anxiety causing especially LSD. Would take at least 200ug myself but it is better to build up. The terminal cancer patient study in Switzerland with LSD seems to show low 20ug doses to cause a bit more anxiety compared to regular 200ug doses in the short term. 20ug is below threshold so could be a placebo effect but would like to see more research.

When you start with this shows I am a newbie people will assume you have almost no experience with psychedelics. Difference in responses. It sounds like you have limited experience based on not having done LSD yet. LSD is the representative molecule for psychedelics for comparing all other psychedelics. Would hesitate saying that I know the headspace, the feeling, what to expect about psychedelics, I believe you have a good idea for sure though. Picture you visiting some areas around my fatherland and trying to describe where I grew up based on surrounding areas. You will have an idea but not the whole thing. If you have not tripped more than 15 times over a period of years I would say you are a newbie. Not judging just trying to frame my response to help out.   Glad you mentioned that about mushrooms. There is supposedly a sweet spot in terms of anxiety that was researched in the last 3-5 years. With 5g you are within the range for the potential for the trip to go bad at about 50%. Heard this repeated over the years about bad trips from mushrooms at higher dosage but never any evidence.  Do not think this applies to pure psilocybin but not sure.  A search should find the study, think it was survey based.   It seems the potential for a bad trip on mescaline is lower overall. I am not very familiar with it but it has more empathogenic effects which I believe buffers this.  I would hesitate to compare LSD with mescaline or mushrooms in terms of potential to have a bad trip. DMT if smoked is way too short even if the intensity is higher. I had to ride out a bad trip once on LSD, the duration was the worst part as I am sure you know.   4mg without any previous history is rare. I am glad to hear that was too high a dose for you, it would be for most people. It is odd a medical provider would give 4mg initially with no major daily panic attacks. That dosage is made to get you physically through the day not help you work things out. Your provider must have some evidence to start at such a high dosage. Usually the dosage balance point with a medicine is when the negative effects equal or outway the positive ones. This happens as dosage is increased so best to start low unless there was a reason.  Could be you were on other similar medicines, you have mental disorders or medical conditions you are not discussing, you are more anxious then you realize or the medical provider is not that good (it happens).  The average starting dose is .5-1mg daily and then adjusted as needed over weeks usually. You may be thinking in terms of recreational doses that 4mg or even 2mg is not high, medically it is.   I do not suggest you put your entire medical record here but if you have a history (including genetic) of mental disorders (especially anything harmful to yourself or others), physical disorders, and heavy recreational drugs use it can affect things. Besides basic things like your gender, ethnicity, age, eating habits, and any other substances you put in your body which can vary how medicine reacts.  It sounds like you are going to do it either way. If you feel comfortable I personally think 100ug is safe but have no idea what your specifics are. I find lower dosages of psychedelics can be more anxiety causing especially LSD. Would take at least 200ug myself but it is better to build up. The terminal cancer patient study in Switzerland with LSD seems to show low 20ug doses to cause a bit more anxiety compared to regular 200ug doses in the short term. 20ug is below threshold so could be a placebo effect but would like to see more research.     ","I'm not a complete newb when it comes to psychedelics, I must mention.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","axecandy","651.0","2014-07-06T15:12:35","Ayahuasca mothers terrifyingly compassionate destructive love","The Majestic Garden/Safety & Awareness","It was my first Ayahuasca experience. Paranoid about DOXXing myself so I will avoid any more info about where and who. Lets just say that the shaman knew what he was doing.  Before the ceremony we all needed to talk about our intentions. Was told that the stronger the intention, the clearer the experience. My intention was to get feminine nurturing. We were told that Ayahusca was a mother, like mother nature. I wanted a hug from mother nature! I took what they said with an open mind. little did I know what to expect. I went in thinking I would get cuddles and flowers...     The brew took some time to hit me. I thought it was not doing anything and started to look around grinning and feeling quite happy. Slowly the world began to tessellate into tiles with gold dots outlined by appeared to be circuit board patterning. As I slowly sank into the visuals, I began to be surrounded by delicate flowers and vines moving to fill my vision. I felt compelled to enter into this soft loving embrace but as I approached, they turned into thorns. It made me sad, so I tried again to touch them again the thorns became sharper and twisted around dark and foreboding. I thought mother was going to embrace me, but here she was rejecting me, telling me that it was not time for the hug. I got angry and took postured up and demanded a hug. I forced my way violently into the thorns but they pierced me and I was teleported to being a baby.  As a baby I was like a shining emerald seed. I grew into a boy, then a teen and a man. I was living a whole lifetime of experiences. I made love to a woman. I was happy and in love. I was selling drugs. I ended up in jail. I saw myself covered in someone else's blood. I was crying for the mother but she was nowhere to be found. Before I knew it I had become a tired old man, angry and in utter despair. I called for the mother. She did not answer. I screamed for her, threw a tantrum. Lying flat on the ground I began to beat it with fists angry and enraged at her abandonment of me. I beat the ground until I was exhausted and tears and snot dribbling everywhere.  As I lay flat on my face, immobile, exhausted and in grief, I felt her call me. She said, if you want me, hug me. I have been there all along, you just didn't see me. I stretched out my arms and hugged the ground. It was warm and soft. It smelled of fresh soil and I felt at peace. As I let go, I began to sink into the warm soft soil. As I disappeared into my grave, I felt so warm and safe in her arms. Completely immersed and secure, I was finally home. I was finally back to were I started. She loved me so much she gave birth to me to watch me play, suffer and live. Then when it was time, in her infinite love and wisdom she destroyed my body in the tightest warmest hug that I have ever felt in my entire life. In her love and wisdom we get the ultimate hug in the form of death. I felt so much love I could not help but laugh and cry uncontrollably. Came out that night, totally at peace with dying. For me, death was like going back into the warmest of wombs. Funny how womb and tomb are so similar. I never would have thought dissolving into a skeleton with a worm crawling out of my eye would have felt so good. Also the feeling of love and support from the shaman, the witches and other brothers and sisters in the circle was something I will remember for the rest of my life.  I might update this post with what I experienced on the second night of the ceremony once I have digested what happened. It was even more fucked up than the death experience that I am not even sure if I should share it.  Love all of you guys on this forum even though I have never met you. Feel free to share your experiences with Ayahusca here too, I would love to read them.  Axecandy",""

"The Majestic Garden Forums","axecandy","651.0","2014-07-09T07:09:54","Ayahuasca mothers terrifyingly compassionate destructive love","The Majestic Garden/Safety & Awareness","The second night of Ayahusca healing ceremony.  The first night had blown away any expectations. I went in with the intention of complete surrender to whatever intention the medicine would give me. I fully expected to purge like the others in the room this time and see more thorns but it was not the case at all. The shaman played beautiful music. Other musicians played too. I took the brew and settled down.  I felt myself sinking into the ground. I had the sensation that I became very heavy and vast and became the ground that everybody was sitting on. I felt firm and nurturing, feelings of overwhelming love and tender compassion washed over me and I felt it supporting all the others in the room. I felt VAST, and had infinite love to give. I felt as I was the earth herself supporting all life. I completely forgot who I was and just accepted that I was mother earth and in my love I was taking care of all these little plants and creatures.   I gave birth to this delightful little baby. Its hands and feet were so small and delicate, its little gurgles and laughs so sweet to my ears. I kissed the baby and nurtured it with my love and nutrients. A feeling far far far away reminded me that this child was my father but it was very distant like a memory that is either made up or forgotten. The baby grew and started to jump and play. I became the firm ground to support it as it explored its boundaries and expanded itself. I grew plants and animals to feed this child and watched it grow and mature into a strong independent man.  The man forgot about me and strove to work. He was so lonely and sad and had forgotten me. He worked so hard and struggled. He was pushing a huge ball of thoughts and ideas and memories in front of him everywhere he went, it grew and grew as he got older and more weary of his life. He ceased to play and find wonder. The ball of stuff he was pushing in front of him, blocked his view of everything. I loved him so much I cried and cried. I felt sorrow and compassion for him. I fed him still, nurtured him, nursed him. He had forgotten me but I loved him so so much. The ball got so big he gave up. He eventually collapsed into my arms and I held him close to me in a loving embrace. I took away the huge burden he had been carrying. He let out a sigh and fell into my arms and I held him and he became me once more. In my infinite love, I destroyed him and made him me once more. He rested and became me.  I felt that I was the earth, mother earth, I was my father, my mother, every single thing and person. They were all interconnected in such a way. There was so much love it can only be felt and not put into words. Every single thing was love and change playing hide and seek with itself. Every single act was love and not a single thing or act was out of place. It was perfect. It was time to dream and forget. I gave birth to myself, separated a part of me from the rest of myself.  At this point, I woke from the trip and found myself in the room once more. I felt energized and euphoric. The world around me was new and fresh. I felt like a small child who was showing off to newly discovered skills to his mother. It was my time to play and frolic for the delight and pleasure of the mother. I could not refrain from singing and dancing. I was no longer the mother. I was me. I was a separate little thing, fascinated with everything, curious and trusting. At this point, one of the witches saw me playing around like a baby, (which was probably hilarious to her, considering my physical size) so she came up and gave me a hug. I felt so loved and lovable I nearly burst into tears again.  I started to forget what it felt to be the mother, and it feels like a dream now. I am now separated and me again but its okay because that is the way it was meant to be.  I felt the mothers love was from within, that I was the mother and that I would return to her in death but she was always there outside and within. It was so bizzare that even days later I still collapse into tears and hug the ground. Whenever I walk past a little plant just starting to flower I feel the same love as I would feel to see my father as a child riding a bicycle and playing.

Feeling, and I try to learn from it, rather than try to immediately fix the issue, I just take note of it, and consider myself more educated and aware of the issues I'm dealing with.  Relief from  the burdens of life is a major reason to seek the psychedelic state.  Most people are really hard on themselves, I know I am, and I trip to improve myself as much as a recreational and intellectual pursuit.   I wish you many productive journeys!",""

The two things that I remember from this video that stuck out to me are that if you're starting to have a bad trip or veering off into unpleasant territory:  1. Sing. Just sing outloud in order to oxygenate the brain. This can help during the comeup especially as your brain is starting to transition to a tripping state.  2. Talk to it.

Changing your posture, activity, or setting can help. Focusing on your breathing. Remembering that this is just a drug, and that it will work it's way out of you in time.  My most recent trip was my highest dose yet and I ran into some rough spots. I thought of something Jack Kornfield had said about self love and I did a little experiment in trying to act on that. When images or emotions or thoughts frightened me, I remembered that everything I am feeling and seeing is manifesting from within me. Like, my trip was bringing things out of me that I didn't want to face.   So in the spirit of self-love (and with a little courage) I thought to myself ""I'm going to love this, too"" and faced the images/feelings head on. You confront it directly and think, yes, I love you. Even you, that which is upsetting me so deeply. Imagine your love expanding around the fear and enveloping it, give it a mind hug; it's just a sensation. When you focus on loving and accepting, you stop focusing on the fear, despair, or weariness. You begin to feed your energy into positive emotions and soon enough the negative ones fall away.  Look at what frightens you objectively but with love and you may notice just how delightfully silly it is. Treasure the act of feeling and observing, even if it's not you would have chosen to see or feel.

This is just my opinion on the matter on what happaned, but if i had to guess, at the point of Benzo abuse and alcohol, your already slowing down your brain functions, when you introduce DMT into the mix it introduces a constant surge of information where your mind can't handle..It's flooding every sense of yours, and that information doesn't go through..  It was so bad, that me and my friend stayed away from dmt for about 1-2 months. (which might not seem like alot but we were having so many great experiences it was a weekly thing with DMT).

The idea being with time distortion and the ability for most people to competently function performing being impaired that it should be avoided. Diabetic coma on your first trip would not be a great memory if you survived. People on psychedelics are not known for making the best decisions for their medical health while under the influence.  Even though there is evidence that psychedelics do not cause permanent psychosis to develop please note this was done on the general population (almost all Caucasian) by survey. Anyone that is having mental issues caution should be used. Not much is known how psychedelic usage affects certain ethnic populations so caution should be used there if that could be an issue. All of the classic psychedelics have been used almost exclusively by Caucasians and American Indians.   His motivation to try is a positive sign the set is coming along. If he naturally does not have a positive set have him focus on positives until or if you decide to trip. Encourage him to compare the differences between substances (including what dosage level sounds appropriate) especially if you can or will have a few to choose from. Let him come to their own conclusions and encourage curiosity. Have him be interactive in the process including what he is expecting, wanting to do and his goals if he is not already. Psychedelics are a class of substances that you get more out of the more you know (in the long term at least).   LSD tends to distort facial expressions and body types which can lead to guilt if he has self perception issues. This is something not studied just based on several individuals and their reaction to LSD specifically. No idea how they react to Mescaline but seems it would limit negative thoughts more.

The jury of twelve reached its guilty verdicts on all seven counts after deliberating less than four hours. Ulbricht faces up to life in prison. He'll be sentenced at a separate proceeding in a few months.  The seven charges include three drug counts: distributing or aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics, distributing narcotics or aiding and abetting distribution over the Internet, and conspiracy to violate narcotics laws. He was also convicted on a fourth count of conspiracy to run a ""continuing criminal enterprise,"" which involves supervising at least five other people in an organization. in addition, he was convicted on conspiracy charges for computer hacking, distributing false identification, and money laundering.  The verdict was handed up to US District Judge Katherine Forrest in a manila envelope. She gave it to her court clerk, who read it out. The judge then polled each juror, asking them to verbally concur in the verdict.  As the verdict was read, Ulbricht's father, Kirk Ulbricht, held his head. Midway through the reading, Ulbricht turned to face his family and friends, who filled about two rows of courtroom benches. After it was read, Ulbricht was taken out of the room by the same two federal marshals who led him in each day of the trial.  ""It's not the end,"" Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Ulbricht, said to her son as he was escorted from the courtroom. Several other relatives in front rows simply shouted out a quick goodbye. In the back of the gallery, a supporter shouted, ""Ross is a hero!""  The 30-year-old Ulbricht, who the authorities said made millions of dollars in commissions, put on a brief defense of just three character witnesses during the three-week criminal trial.  Ulbricht's defense attorney, Joshua Dratel, told reporters gathered outside the courthouse that he plans to appeal. Dratel said the judge presiding over the trial hampered his defense by excluding evidence and witnesses, a position echoed by the defendant's mother.  ""The defense was shackled,"" she told reporters gathered outside the courthouse after the verdict. ""It's not fair.""  Dratel didn't say much about the negotiations before the trial, but he did say the government didn't make a ""meaningful offer"" that would have reduced Ulbricht's possible sentence.  The trial proceeded over 11 days, spread over three weeks. During closing arguments Tuesday, Dratel told jurors that the data authorities seized from Ulbricht's computer connecting him to the site could have been created by others. ""The Internet is not what it seems,"" he told the six-woman, six-man panel. Dratel has said his client, who did not take the stand, had created the site but was the ""fall guy"" for the site's real operators.  Prosecutors countered Dratel, telling jurors there was a ""mountain of evidence"" that Ulbricht was the Dread Pirate Roberts. Thousands of pages of chats with Silk Road admins and other management documents were recovered from his open laptop.  ""There's no dispute when the defendant was arrested, he was logged in as Dread Pirate Roberts,"" prosecutor Serrin Turner told jurors. ""There were no little elves that put all of that evidence on the defendant's computer.""  ",""

Here is a current list:   Treaties  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) allow generally for the exchange of evidence and information in criminal and related matters. In money laundering cases, they can be extremely useful as a means of obtaining banking and other financial records from our treaty partners. MLATs, which are negotiated by the Department of State in cooperation with the Department of Justice to facilitate cooperation in criminal matters, are in force with the following countries:   Antigua and Barbuda,   Argentina,   Australia,   Austria,   the Bahamas,   Barbados,   Belgium,  Belize,   Bermuda,   Brazil,   Canada,   Cyprus,   Czech Republic,   Dominica,   Egypt,   Estonia,   France,   Germany,   Greece,   Grenada,   Hong Kong,   Hungary,   India,   Ireland,   Israel,   Italy,   Jamaica,   Japan,   Latvia,   Liechtenstein,   Lithuania,   Luxembourg,   Malaysia,   Mexico,   Morocco,   the Kingdom of the Netherlands (including Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Maarten),   Nigeria,   Panama,   Philippines,   Poland,   Romania,   Russia,   St. Lucia,   St. Kitts and Nevis,   St. Vincent and the Grenadines,   South Africa,   South Korea,   Spain,   Sweden,   Switzerland,   Thailand,   Trinidad and Tobago,   Turkey,   Ukraine,   United Kingdom (including Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos),   Uruguay, and   Venezuela.    In addition, on February 1, 2010, 27 U.S.-EU Instruments/Agreements/Protocols entered into force that either supplemented existing MLATs or created new mutual legal assistance relationships between the United States and every member of the EU.   In 2013, the United States entered into an MLAT with the Kingdom of Jordan, but it is not yet in force.   A mutual legal assistance agreement has been signed by the United States but not yet brought into force with Colombia.   The United States is engaged in negotiating additional MLATs with countries around the world. The United States also has signed and ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance of the Organization of American States, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Agreements  In addition to MLATs, the United States has a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA) with China, as well as a MLAA between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. The United States also has entered into bilateral executive agreements on forfeiture cooperation with 20 countries, including:   Andorra,   Anguilla,   Austria,   British Virgin Islands,   Canada,   the Cayman Islands,   Colombia,   Dominican Republic,   Ecuador,   Hong Kong,    Jamaica,   Mexico,   Monaco,   Montserrat,   the Netherlands,   Singapore,   Turks and Caicos Islands,   the United Kingdom, and   the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey (in drug cases only).  Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or an exchange of letters in place with many other financial intelligence units (FIUs) to facilitate the exchange of information between FinCEN and the respective countrys FIU. FinCEN has an MOU or an exchange of letters with the FIUs in   Afghanistan,   Albania,   Argentina,   Aruba,   Australia,   Belgium,   Bermuda,   Brazil,   Bulgaria,   Canada,   Cayman Islands,   Chile,   Croatia,   Cyprus,   Egypt,   France,   Fiji,   Guatemala,   the Holy See,   Indonesia,   Israel,   Italy,   Japan,   Macedonia,   Malawi,   Malaysia,   Mauritius,   Mexico,   Moldova,   Montenegro,   Netherlands,   Nigeria,   Panama,   Paraguay,   Philippines,   Poland,   Romania,   Russia,   San Marino,   Saudi Arabia,   Senegal,   Serbia,   Singapore,  Slovenia,   South Africa,   South Korea,   Spain,   Sri Lanka,   the Money Laundering Prevention Commission of Taiwan, Turkey,  and the United Kingdom.   FinCEN also exchanges information with other members of the Egmont Group of FIUs pursuant to the Egmont Principles for Information Sharing Between FIUs for Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Cases. During 2013, FinCEN established an MOU to facilitate the exchange of supervisory information with Mexicos National Banking and Securities Commission, in support of both agencies AML/CFT missions.

If it was a private citizen or business in one of these countries they would face great risk. If somehow you were able to contact a government and convince them to allow your project, I could see that potentially bringing conspiracy, espionage and/or treason charges if caught. I would be careful. Any country you set this up in will most likely be the government to protect you if something happens. You might find yourself living somewhere not friendly.   Could try an area of instability if the infrastructure was still intact. Would not be a permanent location and could easily be physically knocked out. Both could be desired if you are willing to move regularly or use other servers too. The increase in traffic would be very noticeable limiting time it could be run.  There are quite a few small countries which may not have the resources to monitor or traditionally arent monitored but are still technologically sound in places. Oceania and SE Asia has many, small isolated island countries that might do. Again traffic would spike compared to normal for those regions.  Not sure if a mobile platform would work, perhaps a barge or transport ship on long voyages. Would be weather dependent and not sure max data that can be relayed this way. Highly likely it would be well below average DN server rates limiting traffic and feasibility. Could stagger users by giving designated log in periods to increase your capacity.  ",""

"The Majestic Garden Forums","SpaceYourFace","420.0","2014-05-29T15:43:48","PGP trial thread.","Support/Security","Before I go on my little rant I'd like to reiterate the convenience and, most importantly, SECURITY of running/storing vitually everything you do on Tor and these markets on an external drive (USB flash drive, etc).  I've had such a hard time with PGP for Mac. A couple years ago I used PortablePGP, but when I recently got back in to using it I have errors coming from the terminal saying that my Java JCE files aren't signed correctly or something to that effect.  People have recommended online Java-based PGP services to me for their ease of use but that seems very very unsecure to me. I've heard mixed opinions.  To answer the two people above me, every PGP program I've ever used requires you to format your encrypted message to ""plain text"" (unless of course the program does it on its own) which is easy to do in any basic text editing program. As to the question regarding key strength - 4096 characters is perfect, but less is aqeduate, IMO, for anyone who uses these markets for personal use and is not a vendor. 1024 characters is a typical key-strength, but in theory is 4 times weaker than a 4096 character key.  All this is coming from someone who has a hard time with PGP myself. It is much easier on Windows, and actually the creator or PGP encryption has stated (something to the effect of) he won't personally use Macs because they don't work well with PGP. I have both operating systems that I have to switch between because also, from what I've learned/observed, Mac is just less secure when using Tor in general.  If anyone knows of a SIMPLE and SAFE Mac-friendly encryption software or understand my problem with the Java JCE (I've literally tried everything) I'd love some input. The same goes for those online PGP encrypt/decrypt services which I won't name here.",""

"The Majestic Garden Forums","Spitfire","420.0","2014-11-29T06:52:05","PGP trial thread.","Support/Security"," Good advice.    Portable PGP is a security clusterfuck, of the first order. I wouldn't be caught dead using it. I have seen people who used this abortion of a piece of software to generate their PGP keys. As far as they were concerned, the keys looked perfectly normal -- what they didn't realize was that the default keys generated with this software were/are dangerously insecure.   Here is what I mean -- here are the details from a key I generated with a copy of PortablePGP:   pub   1024D/DCBD1130 2014-11-24       Key fingerprint = 63F1 8B58 64F9 DD5A 1E39  2BD7 2852 D8C0 DCBD 1130 uid                  Piece of Garbage Key <pogk@localhost.onion> sub    512g/343CF912 2014-11-24  If you look closely, you will notice 3 things about this key:   1) The key format. This key is in the older DSS/Elgamal format, which was abandoned in 2009. The reason for its abandonment is the dependence of the Digital Signing Algorithm (DSA)/Digital Signing Standard (DSS) on the SHA-1 hash algorithm. While SHA-1 is not yet broken, it has proven weak enough for the developers of both PGP and Gnu Privacy Guard to effectively abandon it.   2) The primary key size, 1024-bits.  In 2009, the default key size was raised to 2048-bits; 1024-bit keys were felt to be increasingly vulnerable to attack/breakage. Five years later on, this is even more of a concern.   3) Most horrifying of all, is the encryption sub-key size, 512-bits. Keys this small were abandoned in the 1990s as insecure. Ten years ago, hobbyists were breaking keys this small on spare machines they had laying about the office.    Anyone who recommends services like iGolder to you is an idiot, and is doing you NO favors whatsoever.    You should have the plain-text radio button selected as default in your TextEdit preferences.    15 years ago, computers were slow enough that there was a performance penalty for using larger keys. Computers are fast enough now that this is no longer the case. EVERYONE should use 4096-bit keys, not just vendors.    1024-bit keys are deprecated -- NO ONE should be using that small a key anymore. 2048-bits is the absolute minimum I would recommend today, and even then only reluctantly -- larger keys are to be preferred.    You are mistaking bits for characters; furthermore, you do not appear to understand the mathematics involved. A 4096-bit key is many, many orders of magnitude larger/stronger than a 1024-bit key. (2^3072, to be exact. That works out to approximately 5.8x10^924)   You've been misinformed. Phil Zimmermann has never said any such thing.    In rough order of security from highest to lowest: Tails/Linux --> Mac --> Windows   GPGSuite will work properly, if you set it up properly. See the tutorial below for details.    No one their right mind will use Java-based PGP software like Portable PGP or online services like iGolder.   Now to your problems with GPGSuite:   I suspect that you have an older, broken version of GPSuite, as the key you have posted is characteristic of older, broken versions. Here is what I mean:   Your PGP has no encryption sub-key:   pub   4096R/B725B678 2014-05-31       Key fingerprint = 32A4 D835 9CFA C868 C2D4  FB72 6DC3 109D B725 B678 uid                  rockmercury <rockmerc@xxx.com>  If you look at the usage flags on your key, you will see that they are SCEA: Sign, Certify, Encrypt, Authenticate  pub  4096R/B725B678  created: 2014-05-31  expires: never       usage: SCEA [ unknown] (1). rockmercury <rockmerc@xxx.com>  Here is my (standards-compliant) key, for comparison purposes:   pub   4096R/8B245B85 2014-11-24       Key fingerprint = 296B 9C0D BFAA 5375 45D4  8CB0 C97D 32F2 8B24 5B85 uid                  Spitfire <Spitfire@MajesticGarden> sub   4096R/730FF9BD 2014-11-24  Note the presence of an encryption sub-key, as well as the usage flags on my key:   pub  4096R/8B245B85  created: 2014-11-24  expires: never       usage: SC   sub  4096R/730FF9BD  created: 2014-11-24  expires: never       usage: E    [ unknown] (1). Spitfire <Spitfire@MajesticGarden>  You're probably wondering, why is this important?   This is important, because in 2007, a German researcher found that keys used for both signing and encryption could leak some of the private key bits under certain circumstances, making the keys easier to break.   As a result of this discovery, in the Fall of 2009, the developers of both Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG) and PGP decided to switch to a dual-RSA key format, with the primary key used for signing/certification, with a dedicated sub-key used only for encryption.   Here is an excellent tutorial I found. This should help you with your problems with PGP on the Mac.   Download and install GPGSuite: https://releases.gpgtools.org/GPG Suite - 2013.10.22.dmg  I'm assuming you've already done that.  Once you have installed GPGSuite,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.  Keyboard shortcuts:  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.  To copy your key to a TextEdit document, open up TextEdit, so you have a blank document open. Then you can use the Insert My Key command, Shift-Command-K -- this will bring up a little dialog box, where you can choose your key from the drop-down box; click Choose Key, and the key will be inserted into your TextEdit document.  You can then use Command-A to highlight the key, and Command-C to copy it to the clipboard. You can then use Command-V to paste your public key into a PM (or an email) for example.   N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP messages/keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.  Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.  To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.  To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.  Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Spitfire@MajesticGarden).  When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.  To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.  Hope this helps.   Spitfire      ","Before I go on my little rant I'd like to reiterate the convenience and, most importantly, SECURITY of running/storing vitually everything you do on Tor and these markets on an external drive (USB flash drive, etc). ;I've had such a hard time with PGP for Mac.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","Thurgood","167.0","2014-02-21T10:17:39","/// MULTISIG CLUB \\\","Support/Security"," Centralized marketplaces are dead.  At this point in the evolution of deepweb marketplaces, decentralization is the only logical next step.  Many kudos to sites such as this that are beginning to move in this direction, I applaud you.  There is no better example proving why multisig is so important than the recent events at Silk Road. Our community would be $5 million (or whatever the new number people are tossing about is) richer if we would've adopted this technology earlier.  One of the most important elements of a decentralized market is a way to make safe, simple, trustless transactions.  Enter multisig.  Previously, this technology was rather difficult for your average user to wrap their head around - requiring using command line to create and handle these transactions.  Fortunately for us, the demand is there, and simplified web UIs are now popping up to make this process significantly easier.   So what is multisig?  Long story short, it's a way to eliminate having one centralized wallet holding all the coins, while still maintaining the benefits of a third party arbitrating.  The huge advantage in comparison to the escrow we're all used to is that the arbitrator cannot single-handedly decide the fate of the coins - making situations like what happened w/ not only the hackers, but also shutdown by LE impossible.  Multiple parties hold the keys to the transaction, and without coming to agreement the coins can't be moved (read: seized/stolen).  Here's a simplified example of how a ""2-of-3"" transaction, which would be the most suitable for our purposes, would work on a site like Bitrated.  This would differ slightly on other sites, but the basic premise remains the same.  1) Seller creates transaction, and sends the link to buyer w/ the stipulations of what is to occur should there be a dispute.  2) Buyer accepts transaction, and then both parties are presented w/ the multisignature transaction page.  3) Buyer deposits bitcoins to the address generated, where the coins are held until two of the three involved (buyer, seller, and arbitrator) sign w/ their private key.  Basically the arbitrator is just a ""tie-breaker"" should the buyer/seller not be able to come to an agreement on who gets the money.  At this point you can also deifne what portion goes to what addresses if it's an agreement that isn't 100% refund, or if the arbitrator has fees for disputes (feature only available on Bitrated).  4) If buyer is satisfied, they sign the transaction.  Their sig alongside the seller's releases the funds to the seller.  5) If buyer is unsatisfied, a dispute is made and sent to the arbitrator, who makes the final decision based on evidence provided and the agreed upon terms linked to the transaction.   So where do I start?  There are currently two websites I've found which offer a simplified service which doesn't require using console/command line.  Unfortunately neither of them are ideal for our purposes yet, but undoubtedly in the very near future there will be more advances in the technology - namely multisig being built into the gui of popular wallet services.  I'll compare/contrast the two below, and if you know of others please let me know!   ***Bitrated***  https://www.bitrated.com  + The most full-featured multisig site w/ clear, easy-to-follow instructions and fairly comprehensive documentation. + There is a clear text field for seller to list the terms before sending to buyer. + Arbitrator is not needed in any way should transaction not go into dispute. + Buyer/seller are given a URL containing their public key, which is all that needs to be held onto to complete the transaction. + Supports client-side key generation. +/- Arbitrators have a username which they can easily link buyers/sellers to, and either can begin the transaction.  In the future this username will have trust ratings similar to LBTC. - Both buyer and seller must be online simultaneously to initiate the transaction.  This is BY FAR the biggest issue, and if it weren't for this there would be no reason to use the other services. - Using this w/o an arbitrator who has set up an account using a client-side public key (instead of a private key generated on the website) is a BIG security issue when conducting the transaction over TOR. - Lacks end-to-end encryption during the initiation step when data must be sent between users. See bug report >>> https://github.com/shesek/bitrated/issues/1   ***Coinb.in***  https://coinb.in/multisig/  + Supports client-side key generation. + Allows types of multisig other than 2-of-3 (can't see many situations this would be helpful for us in though). + Buyer/seller do not need to be online simultaneously. + Any of the parties involved can create the transaction. +/- Barebones UI +/- No need for arbitrator or users to start an account. - Not very user friendly, and very little support documentation. - No support for sending percentages of transactions without creating multiple receiving addresses, and complicating the matter in the process.    What I propose is a multisig club of similar fashion to Pine's legendary PGP club on SR1.  Due to the numerous options available and need for coordination, we will have to work out a separate system for doing test transactions on each site.  I'm currently going over the possible methods for organizing this.  For the time being I'm just looking to see who would be interested in tossing a few bitcents back and fourth, as well as get some discussion going about the current/future options for multisig.  I would prefer to arbitrate transactions myself, but can also act as the buyer or seller simultanously to get a better feel for how both sides of these systems work.

Best to be cautious if you can but there are a few issues here that should be brought up if you are not cautious or aware.   Unique products will be confiscated if found. Anything new/unique to the area will be noted and reported to higher authorities. Most countries (with a high number of psychedelic users) do not just arrest on suspicion, need physical evidence. Minimal need some product or what you think is product. Every arrest may or may not have packaging methods but will have product. Packaging changes, your product stays constant.   No one carries decoy LSD to confuse LE when arrested. Very easy to put out confusing information, commentaries and reviews to hide your distribution network on websites. Finding unique product in a local arrest 2000km from where you send post is more definitive and BTC is not spent on an order.   If more people in an area are overdosing or having to seek medical treatment because of an illegal substance (not usually found locally) the trend is noted also.  Ordering from a vendor shows where someone deposited post to be sent out. Says nothing about where it goes because LE already gave the address. More valuable to know where it is being sent not where it can be sent. Assigning priority to investigate comes from knowing how large, efficient and long term an operation has been running. This can only be done by analyzing distribution patterns.   SR did not cause the invention of international distribution of psychedelics (or other substances) through the internet and mail. It did allow more people to connect efficiently but caused an increased security risk. More people with closer access to direct sources but poorer OPSEC than before. LE has data about known areas of production and distribution IRL especially since LSD became more widespread. They now have more routes to infiltrate these known areas because of DNM activity.   WoW compared to generic prints provides benefit only if someone has no training identifying potential illegal substances. Usually WoW is cut more precisely than a ripped piece of paper. If a small strip of dense, measured paper is found anywhere and there is a suspicion it may contain illegal substances it will be tested. LE would have a harder time with more common objects. Dosing or disguising anything that commonly is daily carried with LSD would be hard to identify to even test. WoW makes more sense from a vendor perspective. Can be any thick common semi-absorbent paper. The benefit of WoW is you can commonly buy it for other uses in bulk and very generic. Custom LSD art bought in bulk is not used for very many legitimate operations.  Do not make yourself a target. By the time an agency is ordering regularly off a vendor their distribution network has already been analyzed hence hundreds of orders. This vendor is already a high priority target would not waste major resources otherwise.   At this point drop locations are investigated. Triangulation of location can be done by analyzing post drops. Regular assumption is either you (or someone you know) is physically delivering the post. This creates a limit that can be traveled regularly because distance takes time (will be by ground transportation, not cost efficient or worth the risk otherwise). Not using a decent random number generator with a large amount of potential drop points will cause a probability distribution pattern to develop. The delay between the order, where it is sent from and when it is received can give a time frame you are normally placing orders.   Some vendors try to overcome this by only having certain periods to distribute. Would not do this. If you have the same temporal pattern of drops (i.e. you seem to start sending out post the next day consistently) far easily to predict on these designated days that everyone with extra post is a potential suspect. Do this a few times and can even compare video surveillance (if present) using just those days, LE does not need to even be present to monitor efficiently. Announcing when you will be vending if irregularly does not make sense. LE wants you to have limited scope or operations, you have narrowed down the data needed to process.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","Godel","643.0","2014-07-03T21:48:09","New revelations about NSA surveillance and Tor","Support/Security","http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_page-1.html  The investigation discloses the following:      Two servers in Germany - in Berlin and Nuremberg - are under surveillance by the NSA.      Merely searching the web for the privacy-enhancing software tools outlined in the XKeyscore rules causes the NSA to mark and track the IP address of the person doing the search. Not only are German privacy software users tracked, but the source code shows that privacy software users worldwide are tracked by the NSA.      Among the NSA's targets is the Tor network funded primarily by the US government to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states.       The XKeyscore rules reveal that the NSA tracks all connections to a server that hosts part of an anonymous email service at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It also records details about visits to a popular internet journal for Linux operating system users called ""the Linux Journal - the Original Magazine of the Linux Community"", and calls it an ""extremist forum"".    It is a small server that looks like any of the other dozens in the same row. It is in a large room devoted to computers and computer storage, just like every other room in this industrial park building on Am Tower Street just outside the city of Nuremberg. That the grey building is surrounded by barbed wire seems to indicate that the servers' provider is working hard to secure their customers' data.  Yet despite these efforts, one of the servers is targeted by the NSA.  The IP address 212.212.245.170 is explicitly specified in the rules of the powerful and invasive spy software program XKeyscore. The code is published here exclusively for the first time.  After a year of NSA revelations based on documents that focus on program names and high-level Powerpoint presentations, NDR and WDR are revealing NSA source code that shows how these programs function and how they are implemented in Germany and around the world.  Months of investigation by the German public television broadcasters NDR and WDR, drawing on exclusive access to top secret NSA source code, interviews with former NSA employees, and the review of secret documents of the German government reveal that not only is the server in Nuremberg under observation by the NSA, but so is virtually anyone who has taken an interest in several well-known privacy software systems.  The NSA program XKeyscore is a collection and analysis tool and ""a computer network exploitation system"", as described in an NSA presentation. It is one of the agencys most ambitious programs devoted to gathering ""nearly everything a user does on the internet."" The source code contains several rules that enable agents using XKeyscore to surveil privacy-conscious internet users around the world. The rules published here are specifically directed at the infrastructure and the users of the Tor Network, the Tails operating system, and other privacy-related software.   Tor, also known as The Onion Router, is a network of several thousand volunteer-operated servers, or nodes, that work in concert to conceal Tor users' IP addresses and thus keep them anonymous while online.  Tails is a privacy-focused GNU/Linux-based operating system that runs entirely from an external storage device such as a USB stick or CD. It comes with Tor and other privacy tools pre-installed and configured, and each time it reboots it automatically wipes everything that is not saved on an encrypted persistent storage medium.  Normally a user's online traffic - such as emails, instant messages, searches, or visits to websites - can be attributed to the IP address assigned to them by their internet service provider. When a user goes online over the Tor Network, their connections are relayed through a number of Tor nodes using another layer of encryption between each server such that the first server cannot see where the last server is located and vice-versa.  Tor is used by private individuals who want to conceal their online activity, human rights activists in oppressive regimes such as China and Iran, journalists who want to protect their sources, and even by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in their efforts to infiltrate criminal groups without revealing their identity. The Tor Project is a non-profit charity based in Massachusetts and is primarily funded by government agencies. Thus it is ironic that the Tor Network has become such a high-priority target in the NSA's worldwide surveillance system.  As revealed by the British newspaper The Guardian, there have been repeated efforts to crack the Tor Network and de-anonymize its users. The top secret presentations published in October last year show that Tor is anathema to the NSA. In one presentation, agents refer to the network as ""the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity"". Another is titled ""Tor Stinks"". Despite the snide remarks, the agents admit, ""We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time"".  The former NSA director General Keith Alexander stated that all those communicating with encryption will be regarded as terror suspects and will be monitored and stored as a method of prevention, as quoted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in August last year. The top secret source code published here indicates that the NSA is making a concerted effort to combat any and all anonymous spaces that remain on the internet. Merely visiting privacy-related websites is enough for a user's IP address to be logged into an NSA database.  An examination of the XKeyscore rules published here goes beyond the slide presentation and provides a window into the actual instructions given to NSA computers. The code was deployed recently and former NSA employees and experts are convinced that the same code or similar code is still in use today. The XKeyscore rules include elements known as ""appids"", ""fingerprints"", and ""microplugins"".  Each connection a user makes online - to a search engine, for example - can be assigned a single appid and any number of fingerprints.  Appids are unique identifiers for a connection in XKeyscore. Appid rules have weights assigned to them.  When multiple appids match a given connection, the one with the highest weight is chosen. Microplugins may contain software written in general-purpose programming languages, such as C++, which can extract and store specific types of data. The rules specifically target the Tor Project's email and web infrastructure, as well as servers operated by key volunteers in Germany, the United States, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. Beyond being ethically questionable, the attacks on Tor also raise legal concerns.  The IP addresses of Tor servers in the United States are amongst the targets, which could violate the fourth amendment of the US constitution.  The German attorney Thomas Stadler, who specializes in IT law, commented: ""The fact that a German citizen is specifically traced by the NSA, in my opinion, justifies the reasonable suspicion of the NSA carrying out secret service activities in Germany. For this reason, the German Federal Public Prosecutor should look into this matter and initiate preliminary proceedings.""  One of NSA's German targets is 212.212.245.170.  The string of numbers is an IP address assigned to Sebastian Hahn, a computer science student at the University of Erlangen. Hahn operates the server out of a grey high-security building a few kilometers from where he lives. Hahn, 28 years old and sporting a red beard, volunteers for the Tor Project in his free time. He is especially trusted by the Tor community, as his server is not just a node, it is a so-called Directory Authority. There are nine of these worldwide, and they are central to the Tor Network, as they contain an index of all Tor nodes. A user's traffic is automatically directed to one of the directory authorities to download the newest list of Tor relays generated each hour.  Hahn's predecessor named the server Gabelmoo, or Fork Man, the nickname of a local statue of Poseidon. After a look at the NSA source code, Hahn quickly found his server's name listed in the XKeyscore rules. ""Yes, I recognize the IP address of my Tor server called 'gabelmoo'."" he said. ""Millions of people use it to stay safe online, and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users, those people are put at risk."" The rule shown to Hahn, published below, has a fingerprint called 'anonymizer/tor/node/authority'. The fingerprint targets users who connect to Gabelmoo and other Tor Directory Authority servers. In Germany, the Tor Directory Authorities like Gabelmoo that are specifically targeted by XKeyscore rules are in Berlin and Nuremberg. Additional targets are located in Austria, Sweden, the United States, and the Netherlands.  The expression below performs essentially the same function, but it specifies the Tor directory authorities located in Five Eyes countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) separately from those in other countries. As the comment explains, the ""goal is to find potential Tor clients connecting to the Tor directory servers.""  Another rule catalogs users connecting to known Tor relays. This is not difficult, because the addresses of all normal Tor relays are published by the directory authorities so that the Tor software on users' computers can select its own path through the network. In addition to the public relays, connections characterized as Tor based on protocol identifiers are also cataloged.  Internet service providers in countries with strong censorship such as China and Iran frequently block connections to known Tor relays. To avoid this blocking, The Tor Project maintains a list of non-public relays called ""bridges"" to allow users to avoid this type of blocking. Bridges are run by volunteers and they share the details with the Tor Project to help censored users reach the internet.  Users can request a bridge address via email or on the web. The following fingerprints show two ways that XKeyscore attempts to track Tor bridge users. First, the fingerprint ""anonymizer/tor/bridge/tls"" records connections to the bridges.torproject.org server. Second, in order obtain the actual bridge addresses for the purpose of tracking connections to them in the future, the ""microplugin"" fingerprint called ""anonymizer/tor/bridge/email"" extracts data from the body of the emails that the Tor Project sends to its users.  This code demonstrates the ease with which an XKeyscore rule can analyze the full content of intercepted connections. The fingerprint first checks every message using the ""email_address"" function to see if the message is to or from ""bridges@torproject.org"". Next, if the address matched, it uses the ""email_body"" function to search the full content of the email for a particular piece of text - in this case, ""https://bridges.torproject.org/"". If the ""email_body"" function finds what it is looking for, it passes the full email text to a C++ program which extracts the bridge addresses and stores them in a database.  The full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it. XKeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using Tor, but who are merely visiting The Tor Project's website (www.torproject.org).  It is interesting to note that this rule specifically avoids fingerprinting users believed to be located in Five Eyes countries, while other rules make no such distinction. For instance, the following fingerprint targets users visiting the Tails and Linux Journal websites, or performing certain web searches related to Tails, and makes no distinction about the country of the user.  The comment in the  source code above describes Tails as ""a comsec mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist forums"". In actuality, the software is used by journalists, human rights activists, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who merely wish to protect their privacy.  The rules related to Tails clearly demonstrate how easily web searches and website visits can be spied on by XKeyscore. On June 25, 2014, the United States Supreme Court noted how sensitive this type of information is in their Riley v. California decision against warrantless searches of mobile phones: ""An Internet search and browsing history [...] could reveal an individuals private interests or concerns - perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD.""  In addition to anonymous internet access, Tor also provides a mechanism for hosting anonymous internet services called ""Hidden Services"". These sites' URLs contain a domain name in the pseudo-top-level-domain "".onion"" which is only accessible using Tor. The code shown below finds and catalogs URLs for these sites which XKeyscore sees in ""raw traffic"", creating a unique fingerprint for each onion address. Each .onion address found in raw traffic is extracted and stored in an NSA database.  There are also rules that target users of numerous other privacy-focused internet services, including HotSpotShield, FreeNet, Centurian, FreeProxies.org, MegaProxy, privacy.li and an anonymous email service called MixMinion as well as its predecessor MixMaster. The appid rule for MixMinion is extremely broad as it matches all traffic to or from the IP address 128.31.0.34, a server located on the MIT campus.  That server is operated by the Tor Project's leader Roger Dingledine, an MIT alumnus. The machine at this IP address provides many services besides MixMinion, and it is also one of the above-mentioned Tor directory authorities. Dingledine said ""That computer hosts many websites, ranging from open source gaming libraries to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium website.""  Sebastian Hahn, the Tor volunteer who runs Gabelmoo, was stunned to learn that his hobby could interest the NSA: ""This shows that Tor is working well enough that Tor has become a target for the intelligence services. For me this means that I will definitely go ahead with the project.  When asked for a reaction to the findings, the Tor Project's Roger Dingledine stated the following: ""We've been thinking of state surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists are threatened. Tor's anonymity is based on distributed trust, so observing traffic at one place in the Tor network, even a directory authority, isn't enough to break it. Tor has gone mainstream in the past few years, and its wide diversity of users - from civic-minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists, law enforcement, and companies - is part of its security. Just learning that somebody visited the Tor or Tails website doesn't tell you whether that person is a journalist source, someone concerned that her Internet Service Provider will learn about her health conditions, or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location. Trying to make a list of Tor's millions of daily users certainly counts as wide scale collection. Their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their ""collect all the things"" mentality - it's worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like China and Iran, and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country. Does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap act? Now I understand how the Google engineers felt when they learned about the attacks on their infrastructure.""  NDR and WDR wanted to know from the NSA how it justified attacking a service funded by the U.S. government, under what legal authority Tor Network users are monitored, and whether the German government has any knowledge of the targeting of servers in Germany. Instead of adressing the questions repeatedly posed to them, the NSA provided the following statement: ""In carrying out its mission, NSA collects only what it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes - regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence targets. The communications of people who are not foreign intelligence targets are of no use to the agency. In January, President Obama issued U.S. Presidential Policy Directive 28, which affirms that all persons - regardless of nationality - have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information, and that privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the planning of U.S. signals intelligence activities. The president's  directive also makes clear that the United States does not collect signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. XKeyscore is an analytic tool that is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system. Such tools have stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. The use of XKeyscore allows the agency to help defend the nation and protect U.S. and allied troops abroad. All of NSA's operations are conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law, including the President's new directive.""  However, the research contradicts the United States' promise to Germany that German citizens are not surveiled without suspicion. Using Tor in Germany does not justify targeting someone, the German attorney Thomas Stadler states: ""Tor users do not breach any laws, it is absolutely legitimate to act anonymously on the internet. There are many good reasons to remain anonymous.""",""

First, if you already have an account that you've bought stuff with you should SERIOUSLY consider making a new account for selling stuff. The main reasons for this is, any orders you've made from your account in the past means that vendor may (or may not) still have your name and address from that sale. This means if you start selling a lot of stuff on here and that other vendor who has your address gets in trouble, they may pass your info along to LE for a reduced sentence or, the original seller could already be associate with LE i the first place.  Either way its not very safe on your part to use a existing buying account for selling.  Your best bet is to register a new account with a username and password you've never used anywhere else!  Once you have your account you need to do some serious studying on the security basic's before setting up a vending account.",""

First of all, would be unperforated white, apparently perforations show up real easy on xray, which some countries like to use on their mail. Secondly, put a return address. Go to street view or take a drive somewhere and if the last house on a street is number 50 return it to number 53 or 58 or whatever because no return address does raise suspicion. And finally, this is probably a bit of a hassle but could pay of in the long run. Make your stealth relevant. If you are sending pills,find something that is legal to send places and camouflage it. If your sending blotts send them as samples from a real paper company. Powders could be sent from a cement company.etc...

New to the deepweb and dnms in general, I recently got some coin and made a purchase on Nucleus from a trusted vendor. However, I was then left over with a little change, and went searching for something to buy with what I had left over. I found a vendor selling single blotters, and decided to buy one, even though they had zero feedback. On top of wanting to spend my change, the product promised was something I desparately wanted to try. What could possibly go wrong? Maybe the guy's a scammer, and I lose $12? No biggie, I thought.    The day after, however, it hit me: is it not possible for a vendor with no feedback to in fact be LE? I am extremely frustrated with myself for being so careless. I spent so much time learning all of the necessary OPSEC protocols to stay safe and anonymous, only to (possibly) hand over my personal info directly to the fuzz.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","schuldig","483.0","2014-05-08T18:46:57","[GUIDE] TAILS","Support/Security","Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.  Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked. Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis."" You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere.  1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it - https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here - https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key 2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here - http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ 3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer 3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer 3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1) 3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2) 3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3) 3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least. 4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  Booting from a USB drive: If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings. You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue. Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar). (Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/ For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can read http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read this http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/ Any other questions, ask away. or PM. I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails... https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin Next up: Installing a Persistent Volume alongside a LiveUSB copy of Tails (this is why you need TWO USB drives) 5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional. 7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'. 7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install"" 7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!) 7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB. 8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required. 9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.) 9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!"" characters   ) 9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish. 9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything. 10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume. 11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (I was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).  Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails!   You are now finished! Feel free to click through all the menus and play with the applications.",""

"The Majestic Garden Forums","JudgeDredd","2194.0","2015-06-12T23:25:46","Drops / Delivery Locations / PO Boxes","Support/Security","So I've been toying with the idea of going for a bulk order of MDMA. For all past orders that I've placed, I have them sent directly to my door, with no second thoughts, as most of the stuff I've been ordering has been either on blotters or small amounts of powder. I've had absolutely no issues doing this, always clean house beforehand and practice good OPSEC.   However, from what I understand, bulk MDMA, especially from overseas, seems to be one of the more watched and regulated shipment types across DNMs. It seems that most CD stories I've read have always been an international bulk MDMA order. This worries me a bit, and I'd like to throw out some ideas that I've been floating around in my head now for the past week to see what others think.   So, idea #1: Clean house like normal, get it shipped directly to me.   What worries me about this method is that even if I have a clean house, and happen to get a CD, I am now and forever probably on the local (possibly Federal?) LE watch list, which, of course is bad for business. If this were the case, I would be done with ""the game"" as they call it, and would not touch DNMs again. The obvious advantage to this method is that I have the ability to step away from this scott-free if shit does indeed hit the fan, so long as I keep my mouth shut and lawyer up.  Idea #2 I get a quality fake ID and open a temporary PO box at the local mom and pop postage shop. I send some junk mail to the box to make it appear normal, then send my order there, wait a week or two, and then go and pick it up in the middle of the night, and then never step foot in that establishment again. The obvious disadvantages to this, is that if I'm caught, they will most likely be able to tell that the box was rented under a fake ID, and at that point all plausible deniability goes out the window and I am fucked. The advantage to this method would be that there would be no connection to my name whatsoever, and I would have a much more controlled environment so to speak. I would be able to check out the surrounding area before entering to retrieve the package, and could even fake a pick up to see if I get swarmed by LE on my way out.  If anyone has any experience with bulk international MDMA orders and would care to chime in, that would be sweet. I could also completely understand if people don't want to talk about their OPSEC methods. Feel free to poke holes in my methods, or throw me new ideas. I definitely appreciate good discussion. ",""

If you are not using tails already I would highly recommend it. It comes preconfigured with Tor, GPG, Off The Record, Truecrypt, IRC and electrum is very easy to add. This tutorial could be used with linux but you would need to manually install otr and configure the proxy. If anyone would like I can write a tutorial for ubuntu and debian based OS.  Open up pidgin messenger by either clicking the pidgin icon or going to Applications->Internet->Pidgin.  The first time you open it the manage accounts tab should pop up but if it does not go to Accounts->Manage Accounts->Add  Under accopunt type select XMPP/Jabber  Enter information as follows:  Username: Pick one Domain: jabber.ccc.de Resource : leave blank Password: create one Create New Account On This Server (check box)  Next click the Advanced tab Leave the Require SSL box checked Connect port: 5222 Connect Server : okj7xc6j2szr2y75.onion Leave the rest of the settings as they are  Next click the proxy tab It should say ""use global settings"" Leave that as it is  Click the Add button and it should log you on.    At this point it is important to create an OTR key.   Go to Tools->Plugins->OTR Off The Record and make sure it is enabled  Click configure plugin.  You will need to select the account you just created from the drop down tab. It should say no key present and generate key. Click generate key.   At this point you will have an OTR fingerprint. When you start talking to someone from the forums or here you will need to add them to your buddy list and start a private conversation with them. To do this go to the OTR menu in the chat box and click start private conversation. It will give you a warning that they are not authenticated. Click authenticate buddy and go to manual fingerprint verification. Have them send you a copy of their OTR fingerprint either through email or the forums encrypted with your PGP key. Once you have made sure that the fingerprints match click authenticate buddy.   At this point you are communicating in real time with perfect forward secrecy. This means that every chat session has a unique key and unlike email they cannot go back and decrypt your chats even if they recover your OTR key. Mixing the tor hidden service plus OTR provides you complete anonymity, privacy and plausible deniability.   This method does not use a hidden service for file transfers but all file transfers are routed over tor. I would not accept file transfers unless you completely trust the person sending the file.     Anyone wants to chat send me a PM.     This tutorial uses Chaos Computer Clubs Hidden service but you can substitute any other hidden jabber service.   Namaste  Inanna   ",""

I believe that we are creatures of habit and it is often very difficult to even acknowledge our loops of action because they feel so normal to us. I'm not knocking organizations such as the following because everybody needs a healthy escape, something they love. I had grown up going to al-anon meetings with a family member. The amount of worry and fear that this particular group of people had regarding others in their lives becoming ""addicted"" to verbs, struck me as absolutely absurd. I had a thought as an early teen while the group was religiously getting together for a meeting to feel comfort in their own situations, that addiction is simply a natural human response to avoiding hardships and trouble in our lives.   When something becomes uncomfortable we jump to wanting an escape that will relieve our struggle to find comfort. Whether it be drugs, sex, a friendly conversation or really anything you can enjoyably ""do"".  When I was in college, I struggled very much to complete my work (proudly pushed through it) because anytime things became uncomfortable I was tempted to ""escape"". My escape was to pack up the bong and power up the gaming rig. I'd lose myself for sometimes days on end skipping classes, meals and chances to build relationships.  To get back on topic, my definition of addiction is simply: To repeatably find comfort in a certain action. The word addiction has a very negative feel to it but in reality it can either be something that destroys us or builds us. Addiction to drugs can have you stealing from loved ones, addiction to learning, achieving and taking care of yourself will have much better side effects    Live in love, not hate    ",""

Perhaps we could like at the idea of Yoga. The union of the body,spirit and mind.  Physical addiction are the most widely accepted.It is hard to deny someone who is experiencing cold turkey. Mental addiction is very scary,When we have a traumatic experience say a divorce or a bereavement.Perhaps the loss we feel, is from the dependence mentally to the other person.  This may be an addiction that 'straight' society can understand.Let's face it everyone will have to face this demon at some point in there life.  So how about spiritual addiction? Well first of you could argue that religious dogma is a form of spiritual addiction? But I know everyone here has a deeper understanding of spirit than that. So coming back to my original question is addiction always a bad thing? Being addicted to spiritual awareness is perhaps our true human nature. Now saying that , If I was to dose on LSD,or MDMA every week or every day.If I become preoccupied with the largest does to show off,perhaps this actually a mental addiction. If on the other hand regardless of the dosage or regularity I devote myself mentally,physically and spiritually to the experience I imagine I will gain the best from it. ",""

To me, true addiction is when someone has such a strong habit, that the brain tells you that you NEED this, in a similar way that your brain tells you you NEED to eat, and you NEED to breath. This NEED is so strong that you find yourselves easily able to do things that society clearly looks down upon.  I don't really consider caffeine or marijuana addictive in a true sense. Yes they can both be extremely habit forming, however if I don't get my cup of coffee for the day or if I don't smoke some herb, I'm going to maybe be a bit irritated. I'm not going to freak out or go rob a cafe for its coffee. I'd like some coffee but I don't NEED it to survive. A nicotine addict on the other hand, will start picking up cigarette butts off the street or even steal them from a friend. A heroin addict will spend ALL his money on dope and stop paying for food for pets, a serious crackhead will rob you at gunpoint with zero reservation.   This is what I consider addiction. An unnatural dependency that is now hardwired into the brain to the point of somone easily and willfully committing actions that even they know, are obviously socially unacceptable.  True addiction is ugly, particularily when it is to hard drugs.  I once knew someone who was strongly addicted to MXE, wow.

When you are with that person, you are happier than you've ever imagined you would be.  Talking to them puts a smile on your face, and the days seem to just melt by.  Yet, when you can't talk to them, the days drag on, boredom sets in and you just want the day to be over.  The depressed hopeless feeling you get when you accept defeat and ""know"" that you can't be happy without them.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","Wilderness","2081.0","2015-06-02T08:21:28","""Tor connections to hidden services could be easy to de-anonymize""","Support/Security","Sigaint shared that on The Hub:   Source: http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/576210/tor-connections-hidden-services-could-easy-de-anonymize/ Github link: https://github.com/filosottile/hstools  Vendors, be careful if you decide to setup your own shop!  El Presidente said on The Hub:   Stay safe!  ","Identifying users who access Tor hidden services -- websites that are only accessible inside the Tor anonymity network -- is easier than de-anonymizing users who use Tor to access regular Internet websites.Security researchers Filipo Valsorda and George Tankersley showed Friday at the Hack in the Box security conference in Amsterdam why Tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks.One of Tor's primary goals is to provide anonymity for Internet users. This is achieved by routing their Web traffic through a series of randomly chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public Internet.The nodes that make up the Tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles. There are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the Internet.Internet servers that receive traffic from Tor users won't see the real IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of those users. What they'll see will be the IP addresses of randomly chosen Tor exit nodes.The Tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well. It makes it impossible for users to see the real IP address of a server that runs a Tor hidden service, like for example, a website.Hidden services use addresses that end in .onion, a pseudo top-level domain that doesn't exist on the Internet and only resolves inside the Tor network. This anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where Internet surveillance is common, but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement.The infamous online bazaar Silk Road where users sold drugs, arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services, operated as a Tor hidden service. The FBI eventually shut it down and arrested its owner, but other similar marketplaces have taken its place.The biggest threat to the Tor network, which exists by design, is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks. This means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays, they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites.The Tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network, so it's relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack. In addition, if an attacker wants to identify Tor users visiting a specific Internet website, they'd have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success, since the relays will be different for every connection.That's not the case with Tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with 100 percent reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between Tor users and specific Tor hidden services, at least for a period of time.Tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special HSDir (hidden service directory) flag to advertise themselves on the Tor network so they can be discovered by users. Every hidden service will select six HSDir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day. This selection is done from a pool of around 4,000 nodes based on a predictable date-dependent formula.With this formula both a Tor client and a Tor hidden service should select the same 6 HSDirs on a particular day. However, the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day.The researchers managed to place their own nodes as the 6 HSDirs for facebookcorewwwi.onion, Facebook's official site on the Tor network, for the whole day on Thursday. They still held 4 of the 6 spots on Friday.Brute-forcing the key for each node took only 15 minutes on a MacBook Pro and running the Tor relays themselves cost US$62 on Amazon's EC2 service.New nodes receive the HSDir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the HSDirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around US$200, the researchers estimated.This technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection, but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point. This can be achieved by someone who can monitor users' traffic before it enters the Tor network.For example, a government monitoring its Internet users through ISPs could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a dissident site hosted on Tor. A law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of ISPs to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a Tor hidden service.The goal of the two researchers was to prove that ""hidden service users face a greater risk of targeted de-anonymization than normal Tor users,"" because it's much easier to reliably control all HSDirs for a specific hidden service than to control all Tor exit relays that might be used to access a website.Runa Sandvik, a security researcher and former Tor developer who was at the conference, agreed that it's technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor Tor exit traffic, but pointed out that the Tor Project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time.There is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem, but also other potential issues, Sandvik said. In the meantime, the Tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of Tor hidden services, she said.A change in Tor that will be implemented soon will make it harder for new nodes to become HSDirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first, Valsorda and Tankersley said. This will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become HSDirs so it will make the attack more expensive, but not technically harder to pull off, they said.While users can't do much to defend themselves against this, the operators of Tor hidden services do have one option. They could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become HSDirs for their own hidden services.This won't prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions, because the attack is essentially a race condition. However, if this happens, it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on, the researchers explained.They released the brute-force tool they created for the attack on Github, as well as a separate HSDir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks.;This was first publicised by Donncha O'Cearbhaill in mid 2013. He described this technique and published some code (since removed) for calculating the relay key necessary to become an HSDir for a given HS at a given time.http://donncha.is/2013/05/trawling-tor-hidden-services/He looked at silkroadvb5piz3r amongst othersIt's good to remind people but we're  kind of suprised this made the news (again).We will chime in with our standard response which isRUN YOUR OWN GUARDS or use guards you trust."

Smiling at some of the stories, life is strange normally even stranger on psychedelics at these type of events     That sounds like a promising idea especially if you know your dosage with it.   Always try keeping the dosage proportionate to the amount of control you or your friend(s) have over the situation. A private, isolated, large personal setting with no interruptions is ideal for exploring dosage limits. Use this type of environment as your functional limit baseline. If you take 500ug in this environment and do not function well that would be your upper limit. Could be more or less depending on the individual.   Take this upper limit and divide by 3 (round to nearest 50ug). In this case it would be 150ug. This seems to give a relative safe dosage to utilize without being overwhelmed in a large, chaotic, public situation with little amount of control.   If you do not have an idea what your functional limit baseline would be than may want to reconsider tripping in a large public social setting.   Would suggest not going lower than 100ug or even 150ug since having a very mild trip can cause anxiety at times.    Psychedelics can cause you to condition yourself. Many people have a story involving something they cannot experience the same because of psychedelics whether for positive or negative. Try and put yourself in a better position to have chances at a more positive experience including taking caution.

Please feel free to add your own ideas on the topic.  - Never use a user name / password that you have ever used on the clearnet - Never use the same user name / password on more than one site - Always try to write in a neutral language - Change identities from time to time and change your writing patterns at the same time. - If you change your identity - don't disappear from the old one and appear with the new one but let both personae stay alive at the same time or... take some deserved rest from the network. - If you change your setup it can be the right time to change your online identity. - Avoid using windows for your darknet browsing - it is insecure. You can either create your own custom linux distribution with security in mind (full disk encryption, firewall to block non-tor traffic, hardened kernel, tor process / browser isolation...) if you feel like it or use whonix or tails if you decide to trust those who made these systems. - Tails is good because it will leave no tracks on your computer. Whonix is good because it provides some kind of isolation. Remove your hard drive when using tails if you can. - If you use an hard drive blank if from time to time and start fresh again. - Learn encryption (gnupg is a great tool) - create your own 4096 (or more) key and use it as much as you can. - If you are a vendor, a journalist in an oppressive country, or a paranoid mind traveler, you might want to work with encrypted material on another machine that stays offline. That way the computer connected on the internet would only be used for encrypted material, making it harder for an attacker to know the content of your encrypted documents in case your computer got compromised or had a backdoor. - Try to leave as little tracks of your activity as possible on the machine(s) you use. - Use an open wifi if you can to make it harder to get to you if tor was broken or you made an mistake in your OPSEC. - Remember that using tor might get you flagged as suspicious individual even in ""democratic"" first world countries. - Have fun, be kind to others - and remember ""if you're not ready to do the time, don't do the crime""...

These are:  -Light -Heat -Moisture  When storing your tabs/liquid, always avoid the above when possible. Even the most basic methods will keep your tabs good for a very long time if the proper care is taken.  Common/Basic Method of Storage  What you'll need: 1. Tinfoil 2. A book 3. A ziplock bag 4. A location that remains at room temperature or below.  Take your tinfoil and fold it around your tabs so that light cannot penetrate it. Place your wrapped tabs inside of a ziplock bag. Before zipping the bag, get as much air out of it as possible. Zip your bag up and fold it so that it may lay flat. Place your bag in between the pages of a book and close it. The pages of the book will absorb any moisture in the air. Store your book in a preferably cool room (temperature controlled is best, room temperature is fine as well).  This very basic method will allow your tabs to maintain their potency over time.  Do Not:  -Store your tabs in a freezer -Store your tabs in the fridge  Unless you have the proper equipment, do not attempt to store your tabs in the fridge/freezer. If you plan on taking them out, extreme temperature fluctuations can cause degradation. Your refrigerator produces moisture as well. Most appliances use tap water for cooling, and most tap water contains trace amounts of chlorine. Chlorine will destroy your LSD.

In this form it is usually reactive only at higher temperatures and with solutions that I am aware of. Any reactions caused would be very slow and only to the molecules having direct physical contact with the aluminum. It will not become gaseous and float around destroying moelcules. This precaution seems excessive to me. Everytime your LSD comes in contact with almost anything it is losing strength. Some will be left behind. I would try to minimize this. There is a thread dealing with the same issues for LSD solutions.   My advice there can be easily applied to other storage methods. I think a vaccum sealer would cause such a change in pressure as to degrade the molecules some. Could be calculated out to see what potential damage could be done by vacuum sealing but would need more information. Maybe 1-2% yield reduction? Just a guess.  The main issue to me is elimination of oxygen, do not get this confused with keeping something dry. Everything else is easy to deal with. Need an oxygen scavenger, but a dessicant will not hurt. LSD is fine with pure water interaction. Not with stuff in water such as oxygen and chlorine. This is always around and hard to control but can be done. Altoid box may have residual aromatic chemicals I would not want floating around. No idea what they could do.   If you want to keep for decades minimize oxygen.

Think this saves a lot of degradation. LSD does not do well when repeatedly exposed to ""normal"" conditions.   Agree a vacuum sealer will keep the atmosphere to a minimum but not sure how the difference in pressure would degrade the molecule (if noticeable). Might degrade as much or as little as 1-2% with each sealing but has not been tested. Can get an idea based on bond strength and fragmentation patterns from a MS. Feel this is a personal preference issue to use a sealer or not. Will definitely remove a bit of oxygen but not sure if it damages the LSD noticeably.  The smaller volume you can store LSD in the better, less atmosphere will be contained. Need to decrease LSD surface area contact as much as possible. Every time you transfer or expose LSD to oxygen, chlorine, UV or higher temperatures there will be less than you started.  Think oxygen scavengers are great for most storage issues and should be used if you keep any substance for months.

The pages of the book will absorb any moisture in the air.

Especially regarding the liquid storage, was just wanting to ask about that. I have heard that temp fluctuations significantly degrade LSD, not sure how this might differ with vials though. Also, if the Liquid LSD is in an alcohol based mixture, would this still freeze in the freezer? I assumed not but not sure if that relies on what % of the liquid is actual alcohol. Anyone that knows please reply!  I am actually tossing up what method would be best for storing liquid. I am not sure whether to just set aside at room temp, or put in the fridge, only thing holding me back from using fridge/freezer is the substantial temperature fluctations every thime I take it out to use (as mentioned above, would need to allow to reach room temp before opening, and then back in fridge where theres another temp fluctuation). Would really appreciate some input on all this! I would probably crack out the vial once, maybe twice a year.  As for tabs, my method is similar to others here. Maybe a bit more pedantic. I individually wrap each tab in foil, then vac-seal my tabs into 200-250ug dose lots. So one 200ug tab per vac-seal or two 100ug per vac seal. There are then stored inside an air-tight container with silica gel (yeh, over the top considering vac-seal) in my fridge.  Reason for individually vac sealing into these dose amounts is cos thats what I usually eat, so this way I can just quickly crack open the jar, remove the dose amount I want, and put straight back into the fridge without the rest of the tabs having to go through temperature changes before I open the jar.",""

Close it, then put it inside the slightly larger baggie with 1 more dessicant packet inside that one.   Empty out your boring coffee into a bowl or something, put your LSD stash in the bottom of the coffee jar, then pour the coffee grinds back over it nice and deep. then stick it in the back of the fridge.

""We hadn't seen ecstasy being seized in letter-class like that in a long time,"" said the Homeland Security special agent. ""Since I'd been at O'Hare.""  Der-Yeghiayan was speaking on Wednesday from the stand in a Manhattan federal courtroom, where 30-year-old Ross Ulbricht stands accused of being the mastermind in the most successful drug-dealing website of all time, the Silk Road.  Prosecutors showed a table full of more than 20 envelopes, with a few varying kinds of labels, all used to ship drugs. ""This was just one day,"" said Der-Yeghiayan, who pursued narcotics investigations from his office at the Chicago airport. ""We hardly had seizures of ecstasy in years past.""  When they did find pills in the mail, it was a one-off on a hand-addressed envelope. By 2011, he was seeing large amounts of printed letters coming from Europe and other countries, with fake business names printed on as return addresses, like StudyAbroad.com.  By October of that year, Der-Yeghiayan had opened an investigation of Silk Road. It would ultimately lead him to a long relationship with the website: first as buyer, then as seller, and ultimately as a staff member, becoming friendly with--and getting paid by--Dread Pirate Roberts, the boss behind the site. Two years after he began seizing those stunning amounts of drugs in the Chicago airport, Der-Yeghiayan came to believe that DPR was Ross Ulbricht.  The last chat would take place on October 1, 2013. It ended when federal agents set upon Ulbricht in a San Francisco public library, grabbing his laptop while it was still open to the chat page.  Walking a jury down the Silk Road  Testimony today was partly the narrative of his investigation, and partly a tour of the Silk Road. It was the jury's first look at the website.  The testimony, which began yesterday and continued throughout today, touched on some things not made public until today: private messages from Dread Pirate Roberts, secret staff-only chat areas, and DPR's guide for drug dealers, covering everything from packaging to ""philosophy.""  Der-Yeghiayan has close-cropped hair, a goatee, and a light beard. On Wednesday, he wore a conservative black suit with a dark tie. Clearly an experienced witness, he shifted his gaze from the prosecutor to the jury as he answered every question.  Shortly after the investigation opened, Homeland Security agents began to make buys from the site. They would compare the drugs they seized, or bought, to Silk Road listings they had seen--and found match after match.  Ultimately,Der-Yeghiayan and his team made 52 undercover buys from the site, from over 40 distinct Silk Road dealers in 10 countries. All but one of the 52 purchases came through with real drugs.  The jury was walked through a few examples, like a chunk of brown heroin, weighing .2 grams, shipped from the Netherlands. Der-Yeghiayan opened the package and showed photos to the jury. The packaging was pro: vacuum-sealed pouch wasn't visible behind a bluish sheet of paper, and the heroin was within not one but several plastic bags. Another photo showed cocaine wrapped in black foil.  In April 2013, they did another buy--a big one. This one was walked through more slowly, so the jury could understand how Der-Yeghiayan bought bitcoins, and what they were. He showed how he used the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange to turn $7,000 into 27.26610656 bitcoins, then logged into a Silk Road account he had taken over, called ""dripsofacid.""  At that point, the court reporter stumbled. ""Sorry?"" he asked.  ""Drips--of--acid,"" Der-Yeghiayan said more slowly.  Then prosecutors ran through the various sections of Silk Road. The Silk Road ""Community Forum"" was divided into five sections: Security, Shipping, Drug Safety, Philosophy, and ""Off Topic."" The Philosophy section was held out to users as the ""Home of DPR's Book Club.""  ""That's where they try to discuss how to use drugs safely, and just, effects of different drugs,"" was Der-Yeghiayan's description of the drug safety section.  ""Has anyone tried MDMA from these sellers?"" read a typical forum post, shown to the jury, which listed three Silk Road seller account names below the question.  On the site's wiki, jurors read about the site's built-in ""tumbler.""  ""Instead of doing a transfer from one account to another, they put a lot of other accounts in between,""Der-Yeghiayan said. ""That masks who the buyers and sellers are.""  ""Avoid abandoned buildings or anywhere it would be suspicious to  have mail delivered,"" read a wiki section called ""Receiving packages."" If you follow these guidelines, your chances of being detected are minimal.  From buyer to seller  Der-Yeghiayan also had access to at least one seller account, presumably from an arrest, called ""SuperTrips."" With that he was able to enter seller-only sections of the site.  On the Silk Road ""Seller's Guide,"" the rules read:      Never ask clients for personal information     Under no circumstances should you save a copy of your client's address.     Publish a public encryption key in your user description on your settings page so your customers can send you their information encrypted if they wish.     No selling ""out of escrow""  That last point was important. The Silk Road escrow system discouraged either side, buyer or seller, from ripping the other one-off. Money was held by Silk Road until both sides were satisfied.  ""Every caution must be taken to maintain the secrecy of the contents of your clients' package,"" advised another part of the seller's guide. ""Creatively disguise it in such a way that a postal inspector might ignore it.... It is your responsibility to stay up to date on the latest stealth packaging.""  Sellers should print their mailing labels, not hand-write on substances, the guide insisted. When selling any substances that had an odor, ""you MUST vacuum seal the package,"" DPR explained, not try to mask it with another pungent thing like coffee.  The seller's ""contract"" with Silk Road obliged them to ""describe your items accurately and truthfully."" Another part read like a corporate mission statement: ""Treat your customers with respect. Go above and beyond for them.""  Der-Yeghiayan read DPR's posts regularly. The site admin at first simply called himself ""Silk Road,"" adopting the Dread Pirate Roberts name in February 2012, around when HSI began buying drugs off the site.  For a drug kingpin, DPR's tone was sometimes quite emotional. One imagines scenes with a therapist.  ""Hey gang, really sorry for the dead time there!"" the site admin wrote after an outage in June 2011. ""This work is scary and exciting all at the same time, and I'm really very happy to be on this journey with you.""  In another post shown to jurors, DPR waxed emotional about the success of his project:      It's great to see that my words are resonating with so many of you. It's a privilege to have a stage to speak from here. It doesn't get said enough, and it is hard to get across in this medium, but... I love you <3      Who knew that a softy could lead an international narcotics organization? Behind my wall of anonymity, I don't have to intimidate, thankfully. But yea, I love you guys. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being my comrades. Thank you for being yourselves and bringing your unique perspectives and energy. And on a personal note, thank you for giving me the best job in the world. I've never had so much fun! I know we've been at it for over a year now, but really, we are JUST getting started. I'm so excited and anxious for our future I could burst ;D  The site's owner stopped going by simply ""Silk Road"" and took on the name Dread Pirate Roberts in January 2012.  In a later message, DPR got angry responding to users who had complained about increases in the commissions he charged on each sale. He wrote:      When have I lied? When have I cheated or stolen from anyone here? When have I treated anyone unfairly? When have I lead you astray? Why do you turn on me now when I have poured my heart and soul into this community and project?      10% on $50 orders? We are talking about an extra $1.88! A $10 order? An extra 38 cents! Do you think this site built itself? Do you think it runs itself? ... Do you have any idea the risk the people operating this site are taking? Do you have any clue what we've been through to get here today?      Whether you like it or not, I am the captain of this ship. You are here voluntarily and if you don't like the rules of the game, or you don't trust your captain, you can get off the boat.  From seller to admin  By July of 2013, Der-Yeghiayan had managed to take over the account of someone who was not only a Silk Road seller, but one of several staffers. Adopting the identity of ""cirrus,"" Der-Yeghiayan earned 8 bitcoins a week, about $1,000 at the time, to moderate forum posts. After several weeks, he got a raise to 9 bitcoins weekly. He kept getting the salary until the site was shut down in October 2013.  ""Cirrus has always been dedicated to our community at large,"" Dread Pirate Roberts explained in a private message sent to a small group of Cirrus and other administrators. The message was sent shortly before HSI took over the account.  It wasn't clear from testimony today how Der-Yeghiayan was able to take the identity of the trusted cirrus; presumably, it was the account of an arrested user, or one who otherwise made a deal with authorities.  Cirrus was part of a group of forum moderators, along with three other trusted users: ""inigo,"" ""Libertas,"" and ""samesamebutdifferent,"" who also went by SSBD.  ""I had admin rights,"" Der-Yeghiayan explained to the jury. ""I could search through the database of users, and I could edit, delete, and move posts on the forums."" There were other things he couldn't do; the distribution of such powers on the site was by DPR, and DPR alone.  In late August, DPR charged cirrus with moderating a new part of the marketplace's discussion boards.  ""You're going to be our quality control expert on this,"" DPR told him in a chat message.  ""So, we're going to be pretty strict about what gets through?"" Der-Yeghiayan wrote back, in his undercover persona Cirrus. ""So basically, the discussions have to be connected to products, not just bitching?""  ""Yes,"" wrote DPR. Users in the special forum should be ""calm, polite, etc."" This wasn't the general forum area of Silk Road, but a different one hosted on the marketplace, that only certain users had access to. ""The forums are the backyard party,"" explained DPR. ""This is the storefront.""  From admin to arrest  Der-Yeghiayan didn't know who Dread Pirate Roberts was, and even after his extensive testimony, it still isn't clear how he found out. On the stand today, he said that an IRS investigator told him Ulbricht was the suspect.  Ulbricht was easy enough to locate. By late September, Der-Yeghiayan was on his way to San Francisco, Ulbricht's adopted hometown. Around noon on October 1, he met up with a team of federal agents in the Glen Park neighborhood. They gathered at a cafe where Ulbricht had been recently. They wanted to see if he would return.  While agents physically monitored Ulbricht and his home, Der-Yeghiayan kept his laptop open on the Silk Road's staff chat channel. He had been watching DPR on the staff chat, and saw that he logged off, around 2:47pm local time. At that same time, ""I was notified that Ulbricht had left his home and was headed in the direction of the cafe,"" said Der-Yeghiayan.  Ulbricht walked into the Bello Cafe, looked around, and walked out, perhaps seeing how crowded it was. The Glen Park branch of the SF public library was just next door. Ulbricht went inside. At 3:08pm, Der-Yeghiayan saw DPR log on. It would be Ulbricht's last online chat for some time.      cirrus: hi      cirrus: are you there      dread: hey      cirrus: how are you doing?      dread: i'm ok, you?      cirrus: good. can you check out on one of the flagged messages for me?      dread: sure      dread: let me log in      cirrus: ok      dread: you did bitcoin exchange before you started working for me, right?      cirrus: yes, but just for a little bit      dread: not any more than that      cirrus: no. I stopped because of reporting requirements      dread: damn regulators eh?      dread: ok, which post?      cirrus: lol yep      cirrus: there was the one with the atlantis  It was a trap. When DPR typed ""ok, which post?"" Der-Yeghiayan knew it meant he was looking at a particular admin screen listing ""flagged"" posts. At that point, Der-Yeghiayan gave the signal, via email. Keeping his laptop open, Der-Yeghiayan told jurors how he walked from the cafe to the library.  Testimony on Wednesday didn't go farther than that: it was nearly 5:00pm, and time to release the jury.  But those following the story know how this ends, of course. Ulbricht was arrested, computer opened to exactly the page the undercover agent had told him to go to. The real cliffhanger isn't what happened in that library, but what happens tomorrow. That's when Ulbricht's lawyer Joshua Dratel will cross-examine Der-Yeghiayan, and begin to tell the story he promised yesterday--the story of how Ulbricht wasn't the Dread Pirate Roberts, but was somehow ""lured back"" to be a ""fall guy"" by the real head honcho of the site. While we don't know the details yet, it sounds like a wild story. It's also Ulbricht's last chance to stay free.  ",""

Thank you for sharing Spitfire    So sad. Cirrus. I remember him vividly. I wonder if forum members ever picked up on a diff in character when his account was overtaken.  All of this rouses abit of worry in me.  How do we know ,ever, if our beloved members of this community- namely the vendors, are overtaken?  How often do we hold vendors accountable by demanding a signed pgp message?  Is that even enough? What if one is to be extorted to give up their private key and password?  I have said this before and I say it again- admins and some members need to have a set of shared secrets with vendors - some kind of info that would not be obtainable or knowable by a mole.   Then again- how would these measures be effected unless some type of suspicion was raised?  I have a feeling if a vendors' account was overtaken on here or elsewhere, it would be seemless,invisible- just like on SR. No-one would know the better. So for all we might know, we are conversing and conducting some sort of biz with an HSI agent.  I'd like to not think so. I'd like to believe in the integrity of vendors stealth and personal opsec. I'd like to think that the underlying technology is robust and virtually impenetrable if all proper measures are taken. Perhaps this is why Agora and Evolution are still up.  Spitfire, you seem to be very security focused. What is your take on this?  Do you have any ideas for ways to prevent\discourage account takeovers and ways to  determine if there is one or to uncover a mole?     ",""

I too had some great experiences with music being almost orgasmic but the next time everything just sounded normal. Of course it would be great if music would always have these exceptional touch to it but it doesn't, so just go on and don't let this ruin your trip and your enjoyment of music in general. Maybe you should try listening to music sober and try to appreciate it that way. Sometimes a longer break from psychedelics can be a very good thing. I think psychedelics worked best when you don't need them anymore to better your life and when you're able to appreciate every aspect of your life to the fullest even in a sober state. So why not starting the other way around and trying to appreciate your life to the fullest without psychedelics and then return to psychedelics from time to time. In the end the consumption of psychedelics shouldn't be self purpose and probably need a lot of time in between.  Anyway, I don't want to sound like a parent here and give advice to a person I don't know. It's just what I would try to do. I hope you can appreciate music again, because it is for sure a wonderful thing.   @topic I also tried some combinations and up to now everything combined very well with LSD If it was DOM, Mescaline, 2C-B, DMT, MDMA or MDA it all worked well and the trips sometimes changed dramatically. N2O is also fun while tripping. ",""

I am sure there is something psychological but I mean..it gets really bad at times..some songs literally slow down to a crawl, others are whiney and very few of them sound good. It has lost that loving, ""spacey"" vibe to it all. Throughout the trip I may get maybe 30mins if music sounding decent. I do wonder if this is due to me feeling incredibly guilty about doing psychedelics. I really feel that I do not deserve to enjoy them cause of other circumstances in life.  In my opinion I also feel that I discovered psychedelics late in life, and I really love to enjoy them, not as an escape from life, but I just really love the whole tripping aspect of it all..and I guess the outlook that our life is limited in order to enjoy these can sometimes rush me to do them. But like I said I have calmed down, which sucked since the summer is when I really wanted to enjoy them all...but I'm down to once a month now..  Actually, one of the things I forgot to mention is that listening to music sober has actually been MUCH better. I am not sure if its a placebo effect or in my head, but it seems like while it isn't great on psychedelics I now get that ""spacey"" sound to alot of the songs I listen to now, which I love, it also seems like there is more love to the songs and the sound quality is better as well.  Visually, being sober I noticed a few things different...first being is that birds/bugs are now leaving trails. At night peoples faces can also have certain shifting effects to them and after meditating colors are brighter and I get a small waviness going on.   Dreams on the other hand have been on the verge of I dont know what the hell is going on. They def are not dreams, and they dont feel like lucid dreaming. They are basically DMT trips while waking up is best as I can describe them.    I think alot of the problems stem from me wanting to end my life before psychedelics, and in the span of 1 1/2 years I've literally gone through a huge amount of extreme life changes. I wonder if that is what can be doing alot of this too. I am changing at maybe a too fast of a rate and I may need to ""catch up"" with myself if that makes any sense. It's literally like getting plugged into the matrix and now readjusting into life has been a bit difficult. I've actually found life to be harder now that I am in a happier stage.  From mental,spiritual,relationships,friendships,works, psychedelics have transformed me at a pretty quick rate..especially with LSD I have no idea what type of person I will be after the trip is done, but so far its been doing great things.   But I will say, psychedelics absolutely are fascinating to me. I don't know if all these trips are basically just our imagination going wild or if its really an outlet for something much bigger than we can even think. Between the visits I get from whatever is out there, them talking to me, even warning me (which I didn't listen to and everything came true)..I mean..its crazy...I've never felt so amazed by the knowledge I've learned on trips and at the same time how little I really know about everything.  @DaFunkFuzz - As far as AL-LAD tolerance goes me and a few other friends have done it weekly and it really resets back to 100%. But 2cb for me I've noticed a tolerance too lol. ",""

I'm new to both so they may have possibly interfered with the trip.)  So I had today set aside to try out 2 hits of LSD acquired from a trusted local friend. He and his girlfriend took the stuff a month or two prior and said 2 hits had them pretty spaced. No suspicious tastes or tongue-numbness reported, so I decided to give it a try.  I don't know if the potency somehow went down DRAMATICALLY in the 2 months I had it stored ( freezer --> jar --> ziploc bag --> foil-wrapped, with dessicant packets, though I did take the jar in and out a few times to get other goodies from it...) or if I got a lousey batch... but I basically got nothing but a buzzy stoned feeling about 2 hours in. Music had a little more depth to it though, and laying with my eyes closed with headphones on let me experience more amplified daydreaming which was kind of nice, but I kept feeling a little annoyed that I couldn't go deeper.  Figured that since I wasn't having the trip I planned, I'd do a little experimentation. Took about 100mg of Phenylpiracetam at the 3 hour mark, well after the peak, to see if it'd change anything this late in the game.    Result:[/u] Aside from the normal energy you get from racetams, no change. No visuals, emotional, or mental changes really. Just kind of wished I was at the gym.

Normally I take psil in double-doses, but I've had pretty good visual-heavy/mystical trips on single doses from this supplier.

This was posted a long time ago on another forum.  I want to know people's opinions on this post!! Any insight is appreciated.  Not all of it deals with the topic at hand, but I will post the relevant part in its entirety for the purposes of context and continuity. :-)  Original Post:  Is it long? Yes. But it is valuable and very interesting.  Please let us know what you think.  Safe travels!!","Piracetam, as I have tried to shown, is safe & beneficial for young, old, and drug users alike, although it helps the most significantly with those that suffer the worst. Therefore if you take piracetam like many transhumanist nootropic enthusiasts do expecting it to take you from average to super smart and don't experience a damn thing then well, don't cry to me. Take much of what is said about intelligence enhancing, memory enhancing, etc, with a hefty dosage of salt (but not too much sodium - ! ) because everyone will respond differently. Personally I have gained enormous benefits from it, and I've been using it for about three years.It's extremely cheap, it's available on drugstore.com in a 500 gram case for $30. A common dosage is anywhere from 800 mg to 8 grams at once or over the day, some people recommend using an introductory attack dose while others only respond well to lower dosages. Once again, experiment to find that sweet spot.A NOTE ON PIRACETAM INTERACTIONS:Piracetam, when mixed with various drugs, produces interesting effects. It most certainly increases the intensity of psychedelics and can give you very out-there trips, and although everyone responds differently most people agree that it potentiates psychedelics. There are many drugs that it interacts with, so here is a short list I've compiled myself, based on what I know personally. Don't take what I say as the word of god...Piracetam potentiates these recreational drugs:MDxx (although I have not tested every various related chemical, piracetam greatly increases ecstasy's euphoria, notably increases hallucinations (CEV & OEV), as well as having a positive effect on the sexual side of the whole experience - and as a male I personally find it easier to get in touch with my feminine & weirdly other side. Expect increased insomnia, though)LSD/LSA (LSD is greatly potentiated by piracetam, except the piracetam to emphasize the clean & mental high that LSD can bring, especially if ergoloid is also brought into the mix; LSA is also potentiated but I've noticed that it is not quite as noticeable as with LSD, your hallucinations will definitely be more vivid & distinct though)Mushrooms (emphasizes, like MDxx, the feminine aspect & allows great connection, when piracetam is mixed with mushrooms it feels like your brain is introducing all kinds of new connections while you connect with the universe, OEVs will most likely be energy-based and not overwhelming but full of inner meaning, while CEVs should transport you to another universe)2c-x (I've only mixed piracetam with 2c-b and it makes it speedier, more euphoric, as well enhancing visuals, although in general piracetam doesn't seem to increase other bodily sense and acts primarily in its memory enhancing effect through some visual component; in addition I find trips are much easier to recall & integrate to life if piracetam is used)Amphetamine (apparently this combination might induce cytotoxicity although I have not researched it conclusively. there are several aspects of this I want to look into but for the most part piracetam potentiates all stimulants)Cocaine (I'm not much of a coke head but I think piracetam affects it in a similar manner to speed)Methylphenidate (your ritalin will probably be a bit stronger but piracetam isn't going to turn your shitty ritalin experience into anything amazing)Ketamine (both times I tried ketamine I'm fairly sure I was on piracetam, and I got very high off of a relatively small amount both times so my gut guess is that it does indeed help but piracetam & how it relates to glutamate and NMDA antagonists should be looked into, too)Caffeine (a good coffee buzz when combined with piracetam results in a low to mid grade amphetamine buzz, with plenty off mania & irritation)Nicotine (because of its effects on choline, I think that being on piracetam greatly potentiates nicotines effect and you may find yourself getting nicotine rushes even if you chain smoke; apparently it is also helpful in stopping smoking and is probably why I can smoke as much as I want sociallyand rarely crave it in private)Alcohol (except to get really sedated, possibly more irritable as well as more sexual although with alcohol your judgement is so clouded it can be hard to tell, although piracetam definitely has a general enhancement effect on alcohol. there was something specific about this mix I was going to touch on but I forgot)Nutmeg (this combination is pretty fucking sweet, especially in a cocktail involving any of the above. part of nutmeg's mechanism of action is anticholinergic iirc while also having effects similar to more classic psychedelics. it is my opinion that piracetam makes nutmeg more stimulating and can offset some of the heavy sedation that comes with it, while enhancing visuals, thought process, and especially libido. nutmeg itself is a fairly decent nootropic, and the combination feels like a fairly calm MDMA roll but with a mindset much more similar to LSD...music can also be greatly enhanced, which happens on piracetam occasionally, regardless of it being combined)Piracetam offsets the effects of:Scopolamine/datura (I made several posts about this before, at a later date I copy paste some info here, but basically piracetam greatly reduces the amnesia induced by datura and can make datura actually worth trying in low dosages, responsibly)Memory loss, brain aging, and cognitive impairment (its main use)Piracetam combined with other nootropics:Hydergeine- another nootopic which deserves a write up of its own, it was invented by Hofmannhimself and combined with piracetam it has a synergistic effect that has been reported by many. I don't think there has been much research into why this happens but the synergy is fucking amazing and can be a very powerful, double-edged sword. On the one hand this combo will definitely help you with learning & memory, as well as increase motivation, energy, creativity, and in general revitalizes your brain and overall well being like no other. As a very interesting side note, lucid dreaming is very greatly enhanced by this combination as are all psychic & paranormal powers. Whenever I get the chance to I order hydergeine, although its price makes it fairly prohibitive compared to inexpensive piracetam. Using piracetam means you can use much less hydergeine and still get double the effects you'd get using either on their own. ""Double"" is a general term here and not an exact medical term, lol. When these two are mixed with psychedelics all bets are off because you will trip way harder then you've ever tripped. I think that at some point every acid head has to try Hofmann's Special: ergoloid and LSD, especially in re: piracetam combination. I've tried the three of them together twice before, and each time were universe-shatteringly epic acid trips. The first time was the most amazing and was a very positive experience that has influenced me forever. The other trip also involved some salvia which made an already very intense experience into a mockery of everything we know as reality as every causal law was bent, broken, or burnt up in the hells of the abyss where I met Satan and learned my way through the very bottom of the Kabbalah's tree of Life.Bromocriptine - piracetam also works well with this, although not nearly to the degree that hydergeine and piracetam do. all three of them together is a sure fire recipe for inducing your own style of manic genius, if the conditions are ripe (i.e.; you have that sort of passion and are capable of learning). the only downside to bromocriptine really is that it always clogs my sinuses.provigil - this combination is very amphetamine like, although with caffeine like jitters. if you stay up for a while and experience sleep deprivation hallucinations from provigil (especially if you abuse it), the piracetam can cause some pretty intense CEV/OEV hallucinations that are very different from classic hallucinations.DLPA - enhances the amphetamine feel to DLPA and it can make one feel very ""on it"", although this combination has a very few times also induced psychedelia which was slightly distracting and seemed to be non-local information that was analogous to my inner state. for instance when I first tried mixing DLPA with a dosage of piracetam (and I think caffeine as well), I was sitting at the computer reading about it when I look up at an unnaturally chaotic red sky, with a 3 dimensional grid like matrix which I have also seen on LSD & mushrooms, although it was of a slightly different nature. this combination can cause some definite anxiety, mania, and the urge to walk around thinking about things.Alright, I've been working on this post for like two hours straight, right after a meff session so I'm going to stop now and take care of mein needs. Excuse all spelling/grammar mistakes, this is a work in progress. If I got something wrong or if you have something to add please let me know, and don't take everything I say as gospel because not only am I merely a passionate amateur without a full college education on the subject and also am generally very high & prone to making stupid mistakes. All it takes is confusing agonists with antagonists to cause a deep fundamental flaw in whatever theory you might have, resulting in mass confusion and looking like a noob.

I just got them today and waiting on OOTP's 100ug WoW tabs.  Now, the setting is going to be comfortable as it is a group of friends (about 7 including myself) with a fire and food and good vibes. We also have a sitter who will be completely sober and can be trusted.  This will be most of our first time doing acid and me and my friend who ordered the shrooms will be doing 200ug for the first time. I'm excited and can disclose I am not using them for some theraputic shit, whatever I learn from the trip is what I learn and reflect for experience.  So it will be a six to eight hour trip for us.  Now the next day we were going to try the philosopher stones, about 1.5g for each of us.  Is this okay? Do we need to eat food before both trips? Wait? (Never understood the food and drink aspect because I read something about fasting)  I would like to know before taking one of the (possibly) greatest experiences of my life.  _Eyeseeker_",""

Seems that Psilocybin has less tolerance associated. LSD is generally more overpowering.   Also tripping two days in a row can be exhausting especially if you do not trip much. LSD the first day will be much longer and cause you to be more tired the next day. Another reason I would suggest Psilocybin first.  LSD enters the blood stream directly so eating before will not affect, not so with fungi which need to be digested.  Agree with Knuckles, 1.5g would be a normal, smaller dose for mushrooms not stones. May want to rethink that.   ",""

But, for dosing those Stones out.  If you went to a coffeeshop in amsterdam, they'd tell you 15g of fresh stones is a good solid dose.  15g fresh dries down to 5g dry. For a good average stone dose, 5g dry is on par with a standard dose of LSD level, albeit shorter than an LSD dose in duration. If you wanna hit a 200ug level, I'd take 10g dry (30g fresh).  This is a 'woohoo' level dose to me, and I can't be in a public place while going through it.

Reading your posts it seems like you have little to no experience with psychedelics. If this is not correct please let us know. Changes how to approach to ensure a quality experience.  If you do not have much experience would highly suggest reconsider tripping for multiple days. Will speak from personal experience that multiple day trips tend to turn into one long trip with varying intensities.

Psychedelics seem to be the same only the effects are more mental than physical. Usually need a mental recovery period even if you are using purely for recreational purposes.

The lower the stone dosage taken the more you will feel the LSD the next day. Either way will feel less than 200ug unless there is variation and actually a far higher dosage is present.  If you take 4g of stones the day before you should definitely trip and probably still feel something off the 200ug. The 200ug may not be as intense but you will get effects. Taking less stones would probably lead to two mild trips or no trip the first day and a mild one the next. Taking more stones would probably lead to one very solid trip and a very diminished or no LSD trip the next day.  Either way more initially is better for trip effects/intensity, more later is better for extending but not enhancing.

Do not obsess too much about it just make sure you take enough to get the experience and you have a positive set and setting. Can be frustrating when you are on the edge of tripping but not. Set a time to dose and an amount to dose then enjoy your time no matter how much you are tripping. Higher trip levels in psychedelics do not mean more enjoyment necessarily.

Best thing I ever did for spice vaping. 1000% better than the machine. Instead of chore boy pad, get Ceramic Vapor Discs, then you can preload discs with 40-50mg (heat it up to melt it into the disc same as you would with chore boy) and carry them around in an altoids tin to share the love!  As for vendors, coming from a vendor, who used to vend DMT but then quit when the elves warned against it. Do not buy it. Extraction is easy peasy.   Grab some MimosaHostilis from a reputable vendor and extract your own magic.  One good extraction run will net you multiple grams of pure white spice if done right. My method is.  Acid Soak bark powder in a glass bottle (I use 1 gallon apple juice bottles as the neck narrowness helps me nab the naptha later) that is in a water bath with the water around it on low boil/simmer for 4 hours  Remove bark powder from liquid using 100% cotton tshirts as strainers  Basify and again simmer the water bath for 4 hours  Allow to cool  Add naptha  Shake/Roll (to avoid emulsion do not do this vigorously) for 5 minutes  Pull your first pull, I use a 100ml Glass Barrel and Plunger Syringe from the early 1900s for livestock, search ebay or amazon for large glass barrel syringe, they also come with massive needles that make you wince at the thought of getting a shot with one, and they double as a great costume piece for your mad scientist costume!  Add naptha  Shake/Roll (to avoid emulsion do not do this vigorously) for 5 minutes  Pull your second pull  Combine pulls and reduce under a fan to about 2/3 or even down to half, should get pretty damned milky white  Line a jar with Baking Parchment  add reduced solvent  stick in freezer with lid on jar overnight (it will go on with the parchments over the lip still)  wake up and rejoice at the white snow in the paper  Lift out paper being careful with the cold naptha  Put parchment in a tray with a fan that is not blowing on it too hard to avoid  blowing away spice goodness  Once dry scrape spice off paper with a card  ---Recrystallize if needed, though once you get this down you can get right to snow white on your initial extraction.  Store in little glass makeup jars available on Amazon (clear jar black lid)  ---Alternatively if you do not mind a little colour to your spice and want a LOT more. Leave the bark in during basicification stages, this will yield you pee yellow Naptha and slightly yellowish spice. Volume increases significantly this way. Say we do a 500 gram powdered bark extraction. Remove the bark and pull 2.5 grams or so of ultra clean no wash necessary spice. Do not remove the bark and pull 4-8 grams of yellowish spice needing a cleaning.   ---Salting really helps increase yields.   ---Full evaporation is another method of removing spice from your solvent, for some reason doing this leaves a light tannish coloured spice. In a double blind I can tell the diffference bwteen orange/yellow and white spice, but oddly not between tan and yellow. Polymorphic crystals for the win!  Yes I acknowledge that a half percent is small yields. But I am about purity over quantity, and I find that if I do it the bark in base method my product comes back yellowed and needs multiple washes to get white, during which I lose spice anyway.   I just opt to show the spirit respect and allow it to give what it wishes within reason. And to be honest I have not ran out of spice in a long time using this method, more bark always comes to me when I need it and the spice keeps a flowing, for the Spice MUST flow.   Dammit, time to load a vapour disc up and vape.  House ",""

My usual rule of thumb is to wait two weeks (at least) between full blown trips, both for tolerance and planning's sake. A week and a half is the longest time I've felt a drop in efficacy compared to a similar dose.  My question is: does the weakening from tolerance scale based on the initial dose? Or is it sort of a ""one and done"" type thing where once you trigger it, it starts the reboot period, no matter how low the dose?  I know that if I took multiple 100ug tabs each weekend for two weekends in a row, i would notice a difference. If i took one (or less than one), how would that impact a multi-tab dose a week later?

Leave 2 days without dosing in between the microdose and the trip, and there'll be virtually no tolerance. You may want to leave a full week just to be sure, or in order to more intensely feel the novelty effect of the trip.  In doubt that tolerance may occur, just add your microdose to your trip dose. For example, instead of taking 100ug for your trip, you can take 115ug.  ",""

I value your experiences and tales thereof.  Banana jack, you're absolutely right. Great info and advice too, re: experimenting for yourself. From my own recent tests I've found that 5 days after ~20-35ug, I noticed virtually no difference on a ~200ug dose. Same for a ~400 ug dose 5 days after another minidose, which makes sense.

"The Majestic Garden Forums","Banana Jack","1839.0","2015-05-23T12:57:00","Microdosing and Tolerance","The Majestic Garden/Safety & Awareness"," These are the kind of tests that need done at least to get an idea for micro dosing and tolerance. Thanks for sharing the information (1+).  Would also be very interesting to see if multiple days of micro dosing followed by a controlled relatively known medium dose (to test for intensity) would cause an actual trip.   So dosing schedule would go as follows; T+0 10-20ug T+1...+4 10-20ug T+5 400ug  If micro dosing causes additive tolerance than 400ug on T+5 should have little to no effect. Assume tolerance doubles each day then by T+5 a micro dose of 20ug should be equivalent to 640ug (320ug assuming all doses are 10ug) if it simply doubles daily. Suggesting 400ug since this would provide a lower bound and if effects are present would show tolerance does not double daily with micro dosing. If no effects are present is a large enough dose to show micro dosing does affect tolerance.  Can also use 400ug as a basis to see if diminished. Think you would trip but would feel closer to 150-200ug for you.   If someone was going to or is currently micro dosing and tried this would be very beneficial for everyone.   ""Acid casualties"" are those individuals which seemed to never really return from the psychedelic state of perception. There are many popular culture references to them mostly being portrayed as having become insane or burnt out. The action of becoming an acid casualty in popular culture references normally happens after large amounts of LSD are dosed (usually accidentally) or after years of long term heavy substance usage.   These people do exist but not in the fictionalized version stated. There are quite a few verified media reports of LE being heavily dosed with liquid LSD and none have shown signs of neurological damage. It does seem that long term psychedelic usage can have consequences on cognitive functions. Usually an individual which regularly and in the long term uses psychedelics will use other substances. Is it the LSD or the other substances?   Can try to compare naturally psychedelic consuming cultures for answers but hard to do. The amount of psychoactive substances in general regularly available in the last century is orders of magnitude greater than previous generations. Not nearly enough evidence.

So lets start    First youll probably screw up somewhere and save something you shouldnt on your local unsafe disk. Dont worry we have a cure for that also      I recommend a free software called Eraser which does a pretty good job. You can download it from http://eraser.heidi.ie/  Next is our favorite TOR which you can download from https://www.torproject.org/  Now I wont cover these programs in depth since they are rather simple and easy to use or have a big community which can explain the details much better than I myself can. I will mostly just draw your attention to their existence so that you may better prepare yourself.  The next software you will need is TrueCrypt which sadly has been discontinued but unlike his mom and pa the internet wont let their child so easily rest in peace.  I suggest you go to https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm To find out more about its history and possible future. You can also download the 7.1a version which unlike 7.2v allows you to encrypt your precious information.  I suggest reading the guide on their site but truth be told its such a magnificent software that its a tutorial in itself. If you manage to get lost in it you are truly and amazing human being or just a human whos to lazy to read a few lines of text    Now you need something with which you can encrypt your private messages on the forums or on the website. We use PGP for this and the 4096 byte encryption.  The program which was recommended to me for this task is gpg4usb which you can download from http://gpg4usb.org/  This software is better than Gpg4win because it allows you to run it from an USB stick which can be encrypted and with no need for installation. Its also much safer since Gpg4win makes backups of your keys and contains several other issues which I read upon the forum that may or may not be true but better be safe than sorry.  Now how to use it. By going to their website you have tutorials that are already well made and that contain pictures which guide you through the whole process. http://gpg4usb.org/docu.html ",""

It comes from sources IRL and my own thoughts. Use common sense when reading; I am just relaying the information. If it does not apply to you or you cannot do it well then skip it.   These are some general methods to hide your identity or at least your regional writing identifiers. Especially if English is not your primary language. There is no reason not to do this if you are able.  Terminology, slang, word choice and spelling vary tremendously around the globe and over short distances within English. Use universal terms if you can. Currency, units of measurement, and references to common objects or actions should be watched closely besides cultural references. What is the area you make toilet in called? Depends on where you are. Greetings and farewells also tend to be regional. Drug slang it should be obvious is regional. Use what the community generally uses even if it sounds odd.  Word check everything, you can pick from British or American standard based on what program you use. Become friends with a thesaurus. If you use a word commonly use a synonym instead. Read blogs or personal websites from English speaking countries. Take the speech of the native speakers and use it.   Grammar and syntax give distinct patterns but usually require more writing samples to analyze. Punctuation usage of an exclamation point, comma, and emoticons should be watched. Do you write like this?!?!? Or maybe like this How about this one   Pay attention to these things. Your spacing, sentence and paragraph pattern too. Do you write very long sentences that could be broken up into little sentences but instead tend to keep going on and on then finally end? Then a small one next. That is a pattern. Even if you vary all your other identifiers most people miss this.   I would advise against writing in a completely different style every time. You will make mistakes that will show you are giving false information and then that information will be ignored for recurring patterns. These patterns left will be your native patterns. It takes less writing samples to cross check than most think. Better to be consistent, pick a style and stick with it. Establish and maintain false patterns that will be confused with true ones.   Last do not fall into your false patterns IRL or outside of Tor. Any other general ideas? ",""

"The Majestic Garden Forums","Spitfire","2050.0","2015-05-30T00:00:00","Harm Minimisation - Seeking Research Participants","The Majestic Garden/Safety & Awareness","Zaphod, over at the Hub, posted some warning information about this survey, which I agree with:    All fine and good.    I can see where the survey would be voluntary... anonymous, not so much, perhaps (more on that below).    The problem, as I see it, is that with respect to anonymity, your needs (and goals) and ours, are in conflict. For  your purposes, using a survey company prevents you from ever knowing who the participants are, or linking any responses to any individual participant (or group thereof). I see this as likely required by ethical guidelines/professional standards.   From  our perspective, our needs and goals are to prevent  anyone from determining our real-life identities, not just you, as a researcher. The method you are proposing that people use on here, will prevent  you from potentially determing our identities; it will not, however prevent the survey company from doing so as far as I can tell.    Naturally, there is no way of enforcing this requirement, is there?    I have a problem with this-- the Participant Information Statement simply cannot be accessed without accessing the survey site. In order to access the survey site, one requires Javascript to be enabled, which potentially could be used to deanonymize survey participants.    Irrelevant, really. This does not provide any real reassurance, as it is a mere assertion that cannot be proven either way.    Given that the information is posted to their server, how can they NOT have access to it?    If you say so. In essence, you are asking us to trust not only you, but also an American survey company, with servers in the United States, which servers require Javascript to function.    We can't see your email address, to verify that it is, indeed, a student email. No one (with two working brain cells, at any rate) should be contacting you via email. The fact that you have not posted a PGP key is also problematic.    Sorry mate, but with all due respect, I would  strongly argue against people on here taking this survey, at least in the manner you have provided-for. Call me paranoid if you wish, but insufficient paranoia all too often leads one to end-up in a jail cell.   That URL you posted appears to require Javascript; at the very least, it would not load on my machine, which has Javascript disabled. In this community, this is a major faux-pas. Javascript can be used to deanonymize people. Furthermore, the server would appear to be hosted in the United States and, more specifically, in Provost, Utah. This makes me even  more suspicious.   Using this type of server  makes sense, from an auditing point of view; capturing the IP addresses of participants, would help ensure that the data has actually been contributed by external participants, as opposed to being submitted by the investigator(s) themselves. (I can see where this would be a useful measure to combat fraud, in any other context but this one.)   This is fine and good, for  your purposes, but it directly conflicts with  our need for provable anonymity.   You state that your survey contains multiple-choice questions, plus space for participants to add their own comments. If I were in your shoes, I would post the plain-text questionnaire in the open, here on TheHub, and let people copy it to their own machines, where they can fill-in the responses they wish to make on their own computers.   If people wish their responses to be anonymous, I would suggest that they setup new identities here, and use these new identities only for the purpose of participating in this survey. From our perspective, this would:   1) Prevent any linkage of information contained in prior postings to the survey responses, and;      2) The use of Tor and PGP would ensure their privacy as well as anonymity.   From your perspective, the only downside of this would be that you would know that the responses came from survey participants on TheHub.   I notice you have NOT published a PGP key -- you should do so, ASAP. Participants should use this PGP key to encrypt their survey responses to you, preventing anyone (including TheHub staff) from viewing the responses. This would have the advantage of (from the participant's point of view) of having Tor guarantee anonymity, as opposed to merely taking someone's word for it.   The process I have outlined above would be the  ONLY manner in which I would urge people to participate.

Â« on: Today at 06:23:01 am Â» -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Ok every one,  I will give the entire run down detail for detail...  We got a message from a buyer here on the forums, asking us whether or not we are set up on this new BS place blueskymarket. We where given a link to this imposter profile.  We did not have an account there, so we made one so we can see what this scammer is trying to pull.  We made our account (seller account) name TheRealOG_. We see this imposter profile (that was copied and pasted from our SR profile, word for word) with the user name ""ogs"". Clearly this was not us, so we open a support ticket with 'support' (LOL) stating the situation, and providing our signed message we explained that this 'ogs' is an imposter and to ban the account. At least one buyer of ours did the same, and i assume they got the same treatment we did. I come back now a short time later to see if 'support' had responded. Essentially what they did was close the support ticket. Then change the imposter account handle from 'ogs' to our 'TheRealOG_'. Then they pasted our pgp signed message into the profile of the imposter account.  They are attempting to make our account there look like the imposter account. Now given the way this is going down, when i say they, it is apparent that 'they' are one in the same or on the same team at the very least (support/admins/mods/market owner/operator/OG_ impersonator).  It is now 100% obvious that it is the market owners/operators that are the ones attempting to impersonate us here at OG_ , and pull a massive scam using our hard earned reputation.  We are in a small way quite flattered that we have gained such clout as a vendor in such a short time that we have been targeted by these pathetic little people. Never the less, we will not just sit back and let them go on to try and tarnish our good name.  Now that we have explained what these idiots are attempting to do, we urge every one who reads this to STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THAT MARKET.  Please every one, stay as far from blue sky market as you possibly can. Tell every one that you know and care about to do the same.  What message does it send that the owner/operator of the site is not only a scamming cunt rag, but they are stooping so low as to single out and impersonate an individual vendor as the cherry atop the scam-sundae.  If any one has any questions or inquiries of any sort, please do not hesitate to message us.  This has been a public service announcement brought to you by the REAL OG_ ( we never in a million years would have thought we would be having to defend our reputation against such fuckery, heh).

Basic OPSEC Tips  First off your on the the âdeep webâ so you have some what of brain finding your way here. Any ways your anonymity is still in danger due to you not knowing what your doing or being a retard, Tor is safe its had some hiccups but nothing really major all the story's you hear like the JS exploit used against âFreedom hostingâ can prevented with some changes to your browsing behaviour. So this is where OPSEC comes into play as Tor can't protect you from your stupid mistakes you have to learn to adapt into this new anonymous network.    JavaScript, Plug-ins, and Other Applications Can Leak Your IP  As of this write up Tor Browser doesn't come with NoScript enabled by default, Java script is by the far the most dangerous threat to your privacy and anonymity as it can be used to do a number of things.   JavaScript may be used to cause drive-by downloads.Possibility of cross-site scripting attacks.Possibility of being used to execute exploits on your browser.May lead to your IP address being leaked. Just listed a few many other possibilities.  To further harden your Tor Browser go to NoScript on the far left hand side Options > Embeddings  Check off the following:   Forbid Java                          Forbid <AUDI> / <VIDEO>        Forbid Adobe Flash              Forbid <IFRAME >Forbid Microsoft Silverlight   Forbid other plugins             Forbid @font-face  Make sure to check off âApply these restrictions to white listed sites tooâ  These option may break sites as they heavily require Java script if your browsing the clear net you can temporally allow JS but be cautious anyways, they probably don't have some secret zero day exploit against Tor after all Tor was originally designed to be used to surf the web anonymously tor hidden services came later in the development.  If you are browsing tor hidden services having JS disabled is an absolute must!    Your ISP monitors your Tor Traffic  Another concern is your ISP, some such as ComCast monitor users activity for Tor. An easy solution to stop your ISP or any one on that network from knowing you using tor is to get a VPN. Your most likely to have used or at least of heard of a VPN by know but some of the most popular VPNs can make your life hell at the worst moments possible. VPN/Proxy providers like âHide My Assâ which rank up the list for most used actually keep IP address logs of there users. Now if law enforcement come knocking at their door they will hand over that data which will identify you, this was seen when Kretsinger used  HideMyAss which linked him to his online persona ârecursionâ to several high profile hacks. HideMyAss  keeps logs of usersâ IP addresses and logon/off times, a UK court order was issued to HideMyAss to turn over the logs related to the offending account, which were then used to identify and arrest Kretsinger. Now what VPN can you trust? Well that's a hard question since a, lot of VPN providers are based in hell (America ). Anyways there is still hope some VPNs like Tor Guard, BT Guard, ShadeYou  and some others don't keep any logs.You have to choose carefully when looking for VPN be sure to check for the following.   Does not log any information that could be used to identify you. Requires minimal personal information to sign up, example only email address or just username and password. Accepts cryptocurrency, you should only pay using BTC if possible.  Also look at their user agreement and terms of conditions to see if they log or keep any user data that could be used to identify you. Take a look at the following chart below for some of the best VPNs to use in terms of privacy.     Here is a list of some bad VPNs that log your IP and other data.     I recommend using Tor Guard or BT Guard, but there in Canada and US doesn't that mean they have to keep logs? There is no law to data of this write up that a VPN provider has to legally keep user logs but in Canada and the US they do have to cooperate with law enforcement. Its best however to choose a VPN provider that is not based in US or Canada like PRG or Shade You. The following two I listed  Tor and BT Guard have multi-platform software available for Linux and android I haven't had any problems with them but you should not heavily rely on a VPN provider to protect you from the authorities. Setting up a VPN is very easy plus a lot of these company's have software for easy setup and use.   Interacting  in the DeepWeb  Know exploring and engaging in the âdeepwebâ are much different, you now need an alias and need to be more careful what you put out there. To start off you should pick a alias/nickname that is generic at best, look at my name for example âPingâ literally cant get more generic than that. Reason being it makes extremely difficult for anyone to identify you as its not associated with you or any other specific person. In addition you can not Google search it an have a specific websites show up related with your name. Next thing is your writing style which if you don't know all ready can identify you as well. There are some recent studies and news such as the NSA identifying users based on how they write text messages on their phones. Some basic tips do not use similar word phrases that you would use when messaging on social media also function words are very specific to the writer. Even if you are writing a thesis, you'll probably use the same function words in chat messages. Your forum posts can be analyzed by law enforcement using specific techniques they could reveal your identity for example if your a botnet owner or a malware tool author. All though I feel this is trivial subject as there is not enough information in just regular forum posts or blogs to single out or reveal a user just based on that data.    Emails, OTR and Jabber  Now you stumbled upon this new hidden internet but how do you communicate? Well your not going to use your Gmail account or you, don't answer that as some people have. The most common way to âsecurelyâ communicate with some one is email, there are a couple big names out there currently number one being Sigaint others include Torbox, Mail2tor, and older ones such as tormail. However there is a big issues what happens if these get seized, well your fucked if the admins haven't taken the necessary steps to secure your data. This is seen in the âFreedom Hostingâ incident where Tormail was seized the FBI had everyone's emails and contacts. Other recent case's such as Sigaint reporting 70 bad tor exit nodes which were reportedly used by a law enforcement agencies, As well Torbox had there own issues when there was an IP address leak. You shouldn't trust a email service but if you choose to use one like me its absolutely crucial to use PGP encryption with all your emails in the case that it does fall in the hands  of law enforcement you wont be affected as its all encrypted. Some other alternatives include Jabber/OTR I slightly better option than email service as it uses OTR (Off the record encryption) the problem comes up when your not using it properly for example not having OTR be default or your friend not encryption on his end can reveal the conversation. As well if you or a friend are arrested and LE get access to his/her computer and there is chat logs of all your conversations. However there is a very low chance of that happening but there is also another option with OTR you can use Ricochet an alternative to TorChat which is no longer maintained. Through these tools you should have secure and anonymous contact with who ever you wish.    Conclusion  There is a short write up and could have gone into a little more detail and expanded on a few points but you should get the idea. Were all humans so were bound to make a few mistakes here and there hopefully the don't cost us jail time, as long as you don't do anything stupid  and keep your âdeep webâ alias as far away from your true identity there will be nothing to worry about. Will maybe write a part 2 on buying goods and services, i2p tutorial and what not anyways hope you enjoyed this  let me know what you think. ",""

There is a great too just for this its called OnionShare which can be found here  https://onionshare.org/   Step 1: Install  Easiest way to install is through the repos for Ubuntu.   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:micahflee/ppasudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install onionshare For Arch Linux,    yaourt -S  --nocolor aur/onionshare For other Linux distros follow the instructions here  https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/BUILD.md#gnulinux.  Once you got it installed open the Tor Browser as its needed before you can share a file.   Step 2: Setup & Share  Next open OnionShare and add your file or files it will automatically compress everything for you.     You also have an option to turn off the web server automatically once the download is finished, this is very helpful if your a vendor for example selling digital goods you can create a one time download link for your customers. Anyways once ready click copy URL.     Send the URL through OTR like jabber or ricochet, once your friend has the download link they will see this.     Once your file has been downloaded you will see that the web server has stopped if you enabled that option as well it will have the download progress of the user.      That's it you can share any files you want completely anonymously but remember to be running the latest version of the tor browser and OnionShare.     OnionShare Command Line  If your having issues for example the ""stop server automatically"" is still occurring even though you have disabled it, its best to use onionshare through the command line. Very simple just use,   onionshare '/home/ping/hostname/' --stay-open Replace   '/home/ping/hostname/' with the location of your file or files and the  --stay-open will leave your web server on in till you stop it. What it should look like,   [ping@Linux ~]$ onionshare '/home/ping/hostname/' --stay-openConnecting to Tor control port to set up hidden service on port 34406.Preparing files to share. * Running on http://127.0.0.1:34406/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)Waiting for HS to be ready:Trying...

Before we get started you should have tor installed and running Linux, but if you must the same instructions can be used on Windows and Mac.   Step 1: Install Pidgin and Tor.  Before we begin make sure to have installed pidgin and tor   https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en  https://www.pidgin.im/download  Once you got them installed start tor through the command line or Vidalia.      Step 2: Run Pidgin and Creating a New Account over the Tor hidden service  The first step is to run Pidgin and then open the 'manage accounts' menu item. Then choose 'add a new account'.      After filling in the new account screen, click on the 'Advanced' tab and fill in the 'Connect Server' with this address ijeeynrc6x2uy5ob.onion. Be sure that the 'Create this new account on the server' check box is selected or don't if you all ready have one.     When that's done, click the 'Proxy' tab and choose ""Tor/Privacy (SOCKS5)"" enter in the following.     Once finished click add and wait. Within a few moments, a new window will pop up titled 'Create a new account'  fill in the username part of your Jabber ID and the password you want. Then hit the 'OK' button.     If all goes well you will see 'Registration successful'. Now all you have to do is enable that account within Pidgin's 'Manage accounts' screen and add your contacts.      Step 3: Using the account and ensuring OTR is always used.  In order to actually send messages, you will need to ensure that the OTR Messaging plugin is installed and enabled in your Pidgin client, and ultimately that your client always sends OTR encrypted messages. If you send messages that are not encrypted with OTR then the messages will be rejected by the server with an error message.  Go to the Plugins menu  Scroll down through the list of plug-ins until you get to ""Off The Record Messaging"". Make sure the OTR plugin is enabled.     Double-click on the ""Off-the-Record Messaging"" plugin and its preferences window will open.  First, make sure the right account is selected in ""My private keys"". Generate a private key if you don't have one already. Make note of your private key's fingerprint. You will need this later when you do key verification with your contacts. Remember that your buddy must also follow all of these steps before you can have an encrypted conversation.      Next, you want to change the ""Default OTR Settings"" as shown to  1) Require private messaging 2) Automatically initiate private messaging.  By default, OTR encrypted conversations are not logged it should stay that way!   Step 4: Communicating with your contacts using OTR encryption   Close the Plugins window. Next, go to the 'Buddies' menu of Pidgin and select 'Add a Buddy'. When it asks for the buddy's username you would enter something like  cock@jabber.ccc.de  Start a conversation with your buddy. When the window opens you will notice that near the lower right-hand corner there is an icon with a warning symbol and it says ""Unverified"".      For your buddy if he/she is using Chat Secure.     Click on that icon and select ""Start private conversation"". Assuming that the software the person on the other end is configured to use Off the Record also, you should then get a notification saying something like ""Unverified conversation with  cock@jabber.ccc.de started."" To start a private conversation choose one of these three methods that pidgin supports  : Question and Answer, Shared Secret, and Manual fingerprint verification. If you know that the person on the other end is also using Pidgin or Chat Secure, you can choose any of the methods. Be aware that if you choose Shared Secret or Question and Answer that your secret or answer must be exact ( including capitalization and spacing ) or else verification will fail.        For your friend.        Once you both authenticated successfully your conversation will now be private!      That's it you got secure messaging with any one you like!   How To: Setup Ricochet (alternative to TorChat)  Now that takes some time to configure and setup another anonymous and fast way to contact some one is torchat but it hasn't been updated for over three years now! This poses a security risk a very good alternative is ricochet which can be found here  https://ricochet.im/.   Step 1: Install Ricochet  This is multi-platform so it can be easily installed one every OS , to get started either install it from your repos for example Arch Linux.   yaourt -S  --nocolor aur/ricochet If its not available in your local repository then build it from source or download it here  https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/releases   Step 2: Setup & Add Friends  Now that you have it installed open it and you will see that it will start tor for you.     Once ready click on the plus sign to add contacts.     Fill in your buddy's info and hit add, once you he accepts you will see him in your contacts.     Now you can securely message your friend!     Well that's it I went through a lot of shit so if I made any mistake let me know, hope this helped you out.   ",""

Before we get started you should have tor installed and running Linux, but if you must the same instructions can be used on Windows and Mac.   Step 1: Install Pidgin and Tor.  Before we begin make sure to have installed pidgin and tor   https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en  https://www.pidgin.im/download  Once you got them installed start tor through the command line or Vidalia.      Step 2: Run Pidgin and Creating a New Account over the Tor hidden service  The first step is to run Pidgin and then open the 'manage accounts' menu item. Then choose 'add a new account'.      After filling in the new account screen, click on the 'Advanced' tab and fill in the 'Connect Server' with this address ijeeynrc6x2uy5ob.onion. Be sure that the 'Create this new account on the server' check box is selected or don't if you all ready have one.     When that's done, click the 'Proxy' tab and choose ""Tor/Privacy (SOCKS5)"" enter in the following.     Once finished click add and wait. Within a few moments, a new window will pop up titled 'Create a new account'  fill in the username part of your Jabber ID and the password you want. Then hit the 'OK' button.     If all goes well you will see 'Registration successful'. Now all you have to do is enable that account within Pidgin's 'Manage accounts' screen and add your contacts.      Step 3: Using the account and ensuring OTR is always used.  In order to actually send messages, you will need to ensure that the OTR Messaging plugin is installed and enabled in your Pidgin client, and ultimately that your client always sends OTR encrypted messages. If you send messages that are not encrypted with OTR then the messages will be rejected by the server with an error message.  Go to the Plugins menu  Scroll down through the list of plug-ins until you get to ""Off The Record Messaging"". Make sure the OTR plugin is enabled.     Double-click on the ""Off-the-Record Messaging"" plugin and its preferences window will open.  First, make sure the right account is selected in ""My private keys"". Generate a private key if you don't have one already. Make note of your private key's fingerprint. You will need this later when you do key verification with your contacts. Remember that your buddy must also follow all of these steps before you can have an encrypted conversation.      Next, you want to change the ""Default OTR Settings"" as shown to  1) Require private messaging 2) Automatically initiate private messaging.  By default, OTR encrypted conversations are not logged it should stay that way!   Step 4: Communicating with your contacts using OTR encryption   Close the Plugins window. Next, go to the 'Buddies' menu of Pidgin and select 'Add a Buddy'. When it asks for the buddy's username you would enter something like  cock@jabber.ccc.de  Start a conversation with your buddy. When the window opens you will notice that near the lower right-hand corner there is an icon with a warning symbol and it says ""Unverified"".      For your buddy if he/she is using Chat Secure.     Click on that icon and select ""Start private conversation"". Assuming that the software the person on the other end is configured to use Off the Record also, you should then get a notification saying something like ""Unverified conversation with  cock@jabber.ccc.de started."" To start a private conversation choose one of these three methods that pidgin supports  : Question and Answer, Shared Secret, and Manual fingerprint verification. If you know that the person on the other end is also using Pidgin or Chat Secure, you can choose any of the methods. Be aware that if you choose Shared Secret or Question and Answer that your secret or answer must be exact ( including capitalization and spacing ) or else verification will fail.        For your friend.        Once you both authenticated successfully your conversation will now be private!      That's it you got secure messaging with any one you like!   How To: Setup Ricochet (alternative to TorChat)  Now that takes some time to configure and setup another anonymous and fast way to contact some one is torchat but it hasn't been updated for over three years now! This poses a security risk a very good alternative is ricochet which can be found here  https://ricochet.im/.   Step 1: Install Ricochet  This is multi-platform so it can be easily installed one every OS , to get started either install it from your repos for example Arch Linux.   yaourt -S  --nocolor aur/ricochet If its not available in your local repository then build it from source or download it here  https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/releases   Step 2: Setup & Add Friends  Now that you have it installed open it and you will see that it will start tor for you.     Once ready click on the plus sign to add contacts.     Fill in your buddy's info and hit add, once you he accepts you will see him in your contacts.     Now you can securely message your friend!     Well that's it I went through a lot of shit so if I made any mistake let me know, hope this helped you out.   ",""

Basic OPSEC Tips  First off your on the the âdeep webâ so you have some what of brain finding your way here. Any ways your anonymity is still in danger due to you not knowing what your doing or being a retard, Tor is safe its had some hiccups but nothing really major all the story's you hear like the JS exploit used against âFreedom hostingâ can prevented with some changes to your browsing behaviour. So this is where OPSEC comes into play as Tor can't protect you from your stupid mistakes you have to learn to adapt into this new anonymous network.    JavaScript, Plug-ins, and Other Applications Can Leak Your IP  As of this write up Tor Browser doesn't come with NoScript enabled by default, Java script is by the far the most dangerous threat to your privacy and anonymity as it can be used to do a number of things.   JavaScript may be used to cause drive-by downloads.Possibility of cross-site scripting attacks.Possibility of being used to execute exploits on your browser.May lead to your IP address being leaked. Just listed a few many other possibilities.  To further harden your Tor Browser go to NoScript on the far left hand side Options > Embeddings  Check off the following:   Forbid Java                          Forbid <AUDI> / <VIDEO>        Forbid Adobe Flash              Forbid <IFRAME >Forbid Microsoft Silverlight   Forbid other plugins             Forbid @font-face  Make sure to check off âApply these restrictions to white listed sites tooâ  These option may break sites as they heavily require Java script if your browsing the clear net you can temporally allow JS but be cautious anyways, they probably don't have some secret zero day exploit against Tor after all Tor was originally designed to be used to surf the web anonymously tor hidden services came later in the development.  If you are browsing tor hidden services having JS disabled is an absolute must!    Your ISP monitors your Tor Traffic  Another concern is your ISP, some such as ComCast monitor users activity for Tor. An easy solution to stop your ISP or any one on that network from knowing you using tor is to get a VPN. Your most likely to have used or at least of heard of a VPN by know but some of the most popular VPNs can make your life hell at the worst moments possible. VPN/Proxy providers like âHide My Assâ which rank up the list for most used actually keep IP address logs of there users. Now if law enforcement come knocking at their door they will hand over that data which will identify you, this was seen when Kretsinger used  HideMyAss which linked him to his online persona ârecursionâ to several high profile hacks. HideMyAss  keeps logs of usersâ IP addresses and logon/off times, a UK court order was issued to HideMyAss to turn over the logs related to the offending account, which were then used to identify and arrest Kretsinger. Now what VPN can you trust? Well that's a hard question since a, lot of VPN providers are based in hell (America ). Anyways there is still hope some VPNs like Tor Guard, BT Guard, ShadeYou  and some others don't keep any logs.You have to choose carefully when looking for VPN be sure to check for the following.   Does not log any information that could be used to identify you. Requires minimal personal information to sign up, example only email address or just username and password. Accepts cryptocurrency, you should only pay using BTC if possible.  Also look at their user agreement and terms of conditions to see if they log or keep any user data that could be used to identify you. Take a look at the following chart below for some of the best VPNs to use in terms of privacy.     Here is a list of some bad VPNs that log your IP and other data.     I recommend using Tor Guard or BT Guard, but there in Canada and US doesn't that mean they have to keep logs? There is no law to data of this write up that a VPN provider has to legally keep user logs but in Canada and the US they do have to cooperate with law enforcement. Its best however to choose a VPN provider that is not based in US or Canada like PRG or Shade You. The following two I listed  Tor and BT Guard have multi-platform software available for Linux and android I haven't had any problems with them but you should not heavily rely on a VPN provider to protect you from the authorities. Setting up a VPN is very easy plus a lot of these company's have software for easy setup and use.   Interacting  in the DeepWeb  Know exploring and engaging in the âdeepwebâ are much different, you now need an alias and need to be more careful what you put out there. To start off you should pick a alias/nickname that is generic at best, look at my name for example âPingâ literally cant get more generic than that. Reason being it makes extremely difficult for anyone to identify you as its not associated with you or any other specific person. In addition you can not Google search it an have a specific websites show up related with your name. Next thing is your writing style which if you don't know all ready can identify you as well. There are some recent studies and news such as the NSA identifying users based on how they write text messages on their phones. Some basic tips do not use similar word phrases that you would use when messaging on social media also function words are very specific to the writer. Even if you are writing a thesis, you'll probably use the same function words in chat messages. Your forum posts can be analyzed by law enforcement using specific techniques they could reveal your identity for example if your a botnet owner or a malware tool author. All though I feel this is trivial subject as there is not enough information in just regular forum posts or blogs to single out or reveal a user just based on that data.    Emails, OTR and Jabber  Now you stumbled upon this new hidden internet but how do you communicate? Well your not going to use your Gmail account or you, don't answer that as some people have. The most common way to âsecurelyâ communicate with some one is email, there are a couple big names out there currently number one being Sigaint others include Torbox, Mail2tor, and older ones such as tormail. However there is a big issues what happens if these get seized, well your fucked if the admins haven't taken the necessary steps to secure your data. This is seen in the âFreedom Hostingâ incident where Tormail was seized the FBI had everyone's emails and contacts. Other recent case's such as Sigaint reporting 70 bad tor exit nodes which were reportedly used by a law enforcement agencies, As well Torbox had there own issues when there was an IP address leak. You shouldn't trust a email service but if you choose to use one like me its absolutely crucial to use PGP encryption with all your emails in the case that it does fall in the hands  of law enforcement you wont be affected as its all encrypted. Some other alternatives include Jabber/OTR I slightly better option than email service as it uses OTR (Off the record encryption) the problem comes up when your not using it properly for example not having OTR be default or your friend not encryption on his end can reveal the conversation. As well if you or a friend are arrested and LE get access to his/her computer and there is chat logs of all your conversations. However there is a very low chance of that happening but there is also another option with OTR you can use Ricochet an alternative to TorChat which is no longer maintained. Through these tools you should have secure and anonymous contact with who ever you wish.    Conclusion  There is a short write up and could have gone into a little more detail and expanded on a few points but you should get the idea. Were all humans so were bound to make a few mistakes here and there hopefully the don't cost us jail time, as long as you don't do anything stupid  and keep your âdeep webâ alias as far away from your true identity there will be nothing to worry about. Will maybe write a part 2 on buying goods and services, i2p tutorial and what not anyways hope you enjoyed this  let me know what you think. ",""

There is a GPU rootkit and a GPU based keylogger available on github. (clearnet)  https://github.com/x0r1/jellyfish (clearnet)  https://github.com/x0r1/Demon  It is a little rough around the edges, but with a small amount of work it can easily be ported to windows. It copies the code from a .dll into the GPU ram, making it difficult to detect. It also demonstrates how to achieve survival after reboot.  A companion project is the Demon keylogger, which uses the DMA architecture in combination with GPU rooting. The logger code runs on the GPU, and the keystrokes are transferred via DMA to be analyzed by the GPU. Since DMA and the GPU aren't able to be checked by AV, it is almost completely undetectable by current tools.  It uses the NVIDIA CUDA library, so is limited in that respect. Intel supposedly supports CUDA, but I haven't tested it on any intel boards yet.  It has worked on every NVIDIA card I've tested so far...16 in all. It has worked flawlessly out of the box. Both projects used the new Pelles C environment. The rootkit is completely dll based, all you have to do is write your malware entry into the .dll, compile, and go.  I plan to add this to most of my future malware. Do a quick test for CUDA support and multi-core GPU status, if true, root to the GPU, else some other root.    ",""

There is a great too just for this its called OnionShare which can be found here  https://onionshare.org/   Step 1: Install  Easiest way to install is through the repos for Ubuntu.   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:micahflee/ppasudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install onionshare For Arch Linux,    yaourt -S  --nocolor aur/onionshare For other Linux distros follow the instructions here  https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/BUILD.md#gnulinux.  Once you got it installed open the Tor Browser as its needed before you can share a file.   Step 2: Setup & Share  Next open OnionShare and add your file or files it will automatically compress everything for you.     You also have an option to turn off the web server automatically once the download is finished, this is very helpful if your a vendor for example selling digital goods you can create a one time download link for your customers. Anyways once ready click copy URL.     Send the URL through OTR like jabber or ricochet, once your friend has the download link they will see this.     Once your file has been downloaded you will see that the web server has stopped if you enabled that option as well it will have the download progress of the user.      That's it you can share any files you want completely anonymously but remember to be running the latest version of the tor browser and OnionShare.     OnionShare Command Line  If your having issues for example the ""stop server automatically"" is still occurring even though you have disabled it, its best to use onionshare through the command line. Very simple just use,   onionshare '/home/ping/hostname/' --stay-open Replace   '/home/ping/hostname/' with the location of your file or files and the  --stay-open will leave your web server on in till you stop it. What it should look like,   [ping@Linux ~]$ onionshare '/home/ping/hostname/' --stay-openConnecting to Tor control port to set up hidden service on port 34406.Preparing files to share. * Running on http://127.0.0.1:34406/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)Waiting for HS to be ready:Trying...

Setting up a VPN is very easy plus a lot of these company's have software for easy setup and use.   Interacting  in the DeepWeb  Know exploring and engaging in the âdeepwebâ are much different, you now need an alias and need to be more careful what you put out there. To start off you should pick a alias/nickname that is generic at best, look at my name for example âPingâ literally cant get more generic than that. Reason being it makes extremely difficult for anyone to identify you as its not associated with you or any other specific person. In addition you can not Google search it an have a specific websites show up related with your name. Next thing is your writing style which if you don't know all ready can identify you as well. There are some recent studies and news such as the NSA identifying users based on how they write text messages on their phones. Some basic tips do not use similar word phrases that you would use when messaging on social media also function words are very specific to the writer. Even if you are writing a thesis, you'll probably use the same function words in chat messages. Your forum posts can be analyzed by law enforcement using specific techniques they could reveal your identity for example if your a botnet owner or a malware tool author. All though I feel this is trivial subject as there is not enough information in just regular forum posts or blogs to single out or reveal a user just based on that data.    Emails, OTR and Jabber  Now you stumbled upon this new hidden internet but how do you communicate? Well your not going to use your Gmail account or you, don't answer that as some people have. The most common way to âsecurelyâ communicate with some one is email, there are a couple big names out there currently number one being Sigaint others include Torbox, Mail2tor, and older ones such as tormail. However there is a big issues what happens if these get seized, well your fucked if the admins haven't taken the necessary steps to secure your data. This is seen in the âFreedom Hostingâ incident where Tormail was seized the FBI had everyone's emails and contacts. Other recent case's such as Sigaint reporting 70 bad tor exit nodes which were reportedly used by a law enforcement agencies, As well Torbox had there own issues when there was an IP address leak. You shouldn't trust a email service but if you choose to use one like me its absolutely crucial to use PGP encryption with all your emails in the case that it does fall in the hands  of law enforcement you wont be affected as its all encrypted. Some other alternatives include Jabber/OTR I slightly better option than email service as it uses OTR (Off the record encryption) the problem comes up when your not using it properly for example not having OTR be default or your friend not encryption on his end can reveal the conversation. As well if you or a friend are arrested and LE get access to his/her computer and there is chat logs of all your conversations. However there is a very low chance of that happening but there is also another option with OTR you can use Ricochet an alternative to TorChat which is no longer maintained. Through these tools you should have secure and anonymous contact with who ever you wish.    Conclusion  There is a short write up and could have gone into a little more detail and expanded on a few points but you should get the idea. Were all humans so were bound to make a few mistakes here and there hopefully the don't cost us jail time, as long as you don't do anything stupid  and keep your âdeep webâ alias as far away from your true identity there will be nothing to worry about. Will maybe write a part 2 on buying goods and services, i2p tutorial and what not anyways hope you enjoyed this  let me know what you think. ",""

There is a GPU rootkit and a GPU based keylogger available on github. (clearnet)  https://github.com/x0r1/jellyfish (clearnet)  https://github.com/x0r1/Demon  It is a little rough around the edges, but with a small amount of work it can easily be ported to windows. It copies the code from a .dll into the GPU ram, making it difficult to detect. It also demonstrates how to achieve survival after reboot.  A companion project is the Demon keylogger, which uses the DMA architecture in combination with GPU rooting. The logger code runs on the GPU, and the keystrokes are transferred via DMA to be analyzed by the GPU. Since DMA and the GPU aren't able to be checked by AV, it is almost completely undetectable by current tools.  It uses the NVIDIA CUDA library, so is limited in that respect. Intel supposedly supports CUDA, but I haven't tested it on any intel boards yet.  It has worked on every NVIDIA card I've tested so far...16 in all. It has worked flawlessly out of the box. Both projects used the new Pelles C environment. The rootkit is completely dll based, all you have to do is write your malware entry into the .dll, compile, and go.  I plan to add this to most of my future malware. Do a quick test for CUDA support and multi-core GPU status, if true, root to the GPU, else some other root.    ",""

Before we get started you should have tor installed and running Linux, but if you must the same instructions can be used on Windows and Mac.   Step 1: Install Pidgin and Tor.  Before we begin make sure to have installed pidgin and tor   https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en  https://www.pidgin.im/download  Once you got them installed start tor through the command line or Vidalia.      Step 2: Run Pidgin and Creating a New Account over the Tor hidden service  The first step is to run Pidgin and then open the 'manage accounts' menu item. Then choose 'add a new account'.      After filling in the new account screen, click on the 'Advanced' tab and fill in the 'Connect Server' with this address ijeeynrc6x2uy5ob.onion. Be sure that the 'Create this new account on the server' check box is selected or don't if you all ready have one.     When that's done, click the 'Proxy' tab and choose ""Tor/Privacy (SOCKS5)"" enter in the following.     Once finished click add and wait. Within a few moments, a new window will pop up titled 'Create a new account'  fill in the username part of your Jabber ID and the password you want. Then hit the 'OK' button.     If all goes well you will see 'Registration successful'. Now all you have to do is enable that account within Pidgin's 'Manage accounts' screen and add your contacts.      Step 3: Using the account and ensuring OTR is always used.  In order to actually send messages, you will need to ensure that the OTR Messaging plugin is installed and enabled in your Pidgin client, and ultimately that your client always sends OTR encrypted messages. If you send messages that are not encrypted with OTR then the messages will be rejected by the server with an error message.  Go to the Plugins menu  Scroll down through the list of plug-ins until you get to ""Off The Record Messaging"". Make sure the OTR plugin is enabled.     Double-click on the ""Off-the-Record Messaging"" plugin and its preferences window will open.  First, make sure the right account is selected in ""My private keys"". Generate a private key if you don't have one already. Make note of your private key's fingerprint. You will need this later when you do key verification with your contacts. Remember that your buddy must also follow all of these steps before you can have an encrypted conversation.      Next, you want to change the ""Default OTR Settings"" as shown to  1) Require private messaging 2) Automatically initiate private messaging.  By default, OTR encrypted conversations are not logged it should stay that way!   Step 4: Communicating with your contacts using OTR encryption   Close the Plugins window. Next, go to the 'Buddies' menu of Pidgin and select 'Add a Buddy'. When it asks for the buddy's username you would enter something like  cock@jabber.ccc.de  Start a conversation with your buddy. When the window opens you will notice that near the lower right-hand corner there is an icon with a warning symbol and it says ""Unverified"".      For your buddy if he/she is using Chat Secure.     Click on that icon and select ""Start private conversation"". Assuming that the software the person on the other end is configured to use Off the Record also, you should then get a notification saying something like ""Unverified conversation with  cock@jabber.ccc.de started."" To start a private conversation choose one of these three methods that pidgin supports  : Question and Answer, Shared Secret, and Manual fingerprint verification. If you know that the person on the other end is also using Pidgin or Chat Secure, you can choose any of the methods. Be aware that if you choose Shared Secret or Question and Answer that your secret or answer must be exact ( including capitalization and spacing ) or else verification will fail.        For your friend.        Once you both authenticated successfully your conversation will now be private!      That's it you got secure messaging with any one you like!   How To: Setup Ricochet (alternative to TorChat)  Now that takes some time to configure and setup another anonymous and fast way to contact some one is torchat but it hasn't been updated for over three years now! This poses a security risk a very good alternative is ricochet which can be found here  https://ricochet.im/.   Step 1: Install Ricochet  This is multi-platform so it can be easily installed one every OS , to get started either install it from your repos for example Arch Linux.   yaourt -S  --nocolor aur/ricochet If its not available in your local repository then build it from source or download it here  https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/releases   Step 2: Setup & Add Friends  Now that you have it installed open it and you will see that it will start tor for you.     Once ready click on the plus sign to add contacts.     Fill in your buddy's info and hit add, once you he accepts you will see him in your contacts.     Now you can securely message your friend!     Well that's it I went through a lot of shit so if I made any mistake let me know, hope this helped you out.   ",""

So what is the answer? well happily there are a number of options available right now. All you need to know are: * MBB - moisture barrier bags* Mylar bags* Heat seal foil bags A non permeable layer must be included, for example when shipping small quantities of powders the layering can consist of a few variations, it may be a good idea to dispense with the zip lock baggy as the zip can be felt through the envelope. The use of double MBB cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol to remove any particle traces is one very effective method. The final stage must of course be done in a clean environment to avoid transferring any particle residue to the outer packaging, wear gloves and discard before completing this stage. The best stealth is sometimes the simplest, envelopes must be as flat as possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands of others going through the system. If an envelope is singled out for extra attention it's gone, that usually only happens when a dog reacts to it._____________________________________________________________________________________________________ VENDORS ALREADY USING THESE METHODS ARE LISTED BELOW >>> Please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non permeable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor.

Mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters. 2. If arriving from a ""flagged"" country it's directed to sorting area A in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country it's directed to sorting area B for normal manual sorting. 3. At the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything that's oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). Over-sized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog) 4. Once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country. 5. Any mail that can't be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again. So using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine. Country of Origin - The intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has ""flagged' isn't made publicly available but one could assume they include - The Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, China, Vietnam, Thailand among others. As well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling. Initial Mail Sorter - Has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesn't attract a second glimpse. Ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one that's thin and soft and likely to tear. Ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure it's as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag! Drug detection dog - USE MOISTURE BARRIER BAGS! PE and Foil layered are the best, followed by PE and Mylar. You should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, you've wasted your time and it will be detected. Final Automatic Sorting Machine - Make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. Make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes) Use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. This includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc._____________________________________________________________________________________________________ HOW TO ENSURE YOUR MAIL GOES THROUGH THE SORTING MACHINES WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE SORTED MANUALLY BY ONE OF THOSE PESKY HUMANS (AU SPECIFIC) The info below is taken from the Australia Post guidelines for international mail, and they're based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines, if a letter falls outside of these guidelines, there's a much bigger chance it will end up being manually sorted by a person. (when you receive a letter than doesn't have one of those faint orange barcodes on it, it means its been manually sorted. This doesn't apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to 1000's of people though) Recommended Envelope Sizes and Max Weight and thickness - Small Letter -DL 110 mm Ã 220 mm   125g max     C6 114 mm Ã 162 mm   125g max      No more than 5mm thick Large Letter -C5 162 mm Ã 229 mm    125g max     C4 324 mm Ã 229 mm    250g max     B4 353 mm Ã 250 mm    250g max      No more than 20mm thick Envelope Quality - White 100gsm Paper Address Font  - Courier or Helvetica Font - 12 point or 10 pitchIt should contain no full stops or commas or other punctuation. You can use '/' but it's recommended not to.There should be no advertising/logos etc near the address.The street number should be 2 spaces away from the unit/suite numberThe suburb and country should be in capitalsThe post code should be 2 spaces away from the stateCharacters should be between 2mm & 4mm talland between 0.3mm & 7mm wideThe space between lines from 1mm to 2.5mm Address example - John SmithSuite 10  52 Silk RoadPORT HEADLAND WA  3001AUSTRALIA Some of these things are going to the extreme and probably not necessary, besides, the huge majority of orders make it without any issues anyway but if you want perfection, this is where it's at. Guideline books (see these for the correct address layouts and where stamps, addresses and logos etc should/shouldn't be placed. - http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/l â¦ -guide.pdfhttp://auspost.com.au/media/documents/i â¦ -guide.pdf Educational video about the mail process (clearnet) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WumR2qpqP8 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Some important info for vendors from Farmer Bob. Very useful in terms of picking the right packaging and cleaning the surface to ensure any traces have been removed. [author=Farmerbob link=topic=76.msg62827#msg62827 date=1385533965]I'm glad to see this is finally getting adopted but there's a lot of misinformation going around. #1 Ignore Mylar & foil!!   only use laminates that were designed and manufactured to be used as moisture barrier bagging.  MBBs are a subset of ""Mylar"" but Mylar does not equate to MBB.  Many products that are referred to as Mylar and maybe even look and feel just like MBBs are not suitable for use here.  Beware of product substitution. #2 don't use Irons, curling irons, or food vac sealers.  They won't give you the consistency & quality of an impulse sealer.  Get a quality impulse sealer (5mm+ width) and read online how to check seal quality.  You should be able to see the outline of the seal-line insulation fabric imprinted on one side.  bond some pieces and pull, the bag should tear rather than the seal peeling apart.  Once you get your heat setting where you like it keep it there but re-check it every few hundred seals. #3 leave some air in the package, clean in in a sink with detergent/soap and rinse in bleachwater.  when it's in the detergent sink squeeze the bags to look for air leakage, no bubble should come out.  Before you pull them out of the bleach bucket wash your hands well.  At this point neither a bloodhound nor a mass spectrometer will pick up a scent from any enclosed drugs provided you don't re-contaminate the bag or contaminate the mailing materials. #4: Purchase MBBs from wherever you like, plutopete, amazon, ebay, etc (anonymously).  There are survivalists, hobbyists, and plenty of small businesses that buy these.  They went out of style with the big-time smugglers decades ago.  Purchasing them won't be suspicious and it's perfectly legal.  Removing Trace Particles Properly: [author=Farmerbob link=topic=76.msg68691#msg68691 date=1385853735] The ""right"" way to do it is to ensure you wash off both polar and nopolar surface contaminants.. so detergent wash followed by IPA and/or acetone followed by deionized water rinse would be the technique you'd use if you could do it properly.  The issue is ""do it properly"" good cleanroom surface cleaning technique is difficult to master.  You have to wipe in one direction only and rotate the rag as you wipe, OR you have to spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down.  The risk is that most people, even trained ""professionals"" cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove it.  sodium hypochlorite bleach (Clorox in north america) is probably a better choice for the masses.  Bleach will oxidize most organic molecules.  Residues that are left behind after a detergent wash will react with the bleach in the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis (MS swab test). An alternative for the lazy is to just throw the packs in your dishwasher with a splash of bleach.  I've done that when I was vending and I had a lot of weed orders to go out and didn't feel like spending too much time cleaning them.  In my case I used a peroxide bleach but everyone else should be fine with Clorox.

If the dog barks and they take it seriously they have to stop the conveyor, run it backward and let the dog point to the area. Then take the mail out of that area and let the dog find the suspicious one. No dog is going to work hard at that 8 hours a day. They get bored just like humans and ignore the conveyor.

Forget convenience when using Tails in a Mac on DVD. It's just no good period. You can't create a persistance volume and the user experience is terrible. I was disappointed not to be able to use a Tails USB but the answer simply is learn Linux on a good second hand laptop. I'm doing it now. I've tried the dual Linux/OS X booting on my mac and it's crap. I've never used Windoze. If you're not buying on DW then just browse on the Mac with TBB on an SSD with a different OS installed and in an external caddy. That's the best for just browsing in private. Don't be plugging stuff in your laptop in Starbucks.  For buying and selling I was told on this forum you need a VPN. I've heard of VPL (Visible Pantie Line) apparently though you need a VPN. So there's another thing you gotta learn. I'm learning Linux (basic stuff is not hard). Linux is good to learn anyway. Don't ask me why yet, it just is, the clever people say so. So, sell your fancy Mac and buy loads of drugs and a good laptop suitable for Linux/Tor/Tails/Loads more. It's the future  Any techies please feel free to correct me.","Edelweiss wrote:Hello,Can somebody give me advise regarding MAC and darknet... Now im using booted Tails DVD on my Mac.

It is signed with Tails Devlopers key ID 0x1202821CBE2CD9C1.gpg --verify tails-i386-0.22.1.iso.sigThe above gpg command should produce the following output: If everything checks out, proceed with the next step.Step 2 - Burn the downloaded TAILS ISO image to the blank DVD.Wait for the DVD burning to complete before proceeding to the next step.Step 3 - With the burned TAILS DVD still in the drive, restart your computer and go to the boot menu then select to boot from the DVD drive.On most computers, you enter the boot menu by pressing either F8 or F12 (depending on your pc) while it is powering up.Shortly after TAILS begins to load, an on-screen menu will show ""Live"" or ""Live (Failsafe)"" - ignore it and it will continue loadind. Then when the greeter asks you ""More Options?"" set the green checkmark â to NO, then click Login and wait for TAILS to finish loading.Insert your USB drive before proceeding to the next step.Step 4 - From the menu at the top-left of the desktop screen, go to Applications > Tails > Tails Installer, then select Clone and Install. A Target Device drop-down list will appear. Select the USB drive from the drop-down list (it should be the only one there)then click Install Tails, then YES and TAILS will begin installing onto the USB drive.The installation will take several minutes. Wait until the installation is complete before proceeding to the next step.Step 5 - Now reboot your computer from the cloned TAILS USB drive. As TAILS loads the greeter will again ask you ""More Options?"" - select NO, then wait for TAILS to finish loading.Step 6 - From the menu at the top-left of the desktop screen, go to Applications > Tails > Configure Persistent Volume, This opens the Persistence WizardStep 7 - Enter your Strong Password twice then click ""Create"".Do not forget this password! You (nor anyone else) will EVER recover any saved persistent data without this password!Step 8 - Check the persistence options you want to enable. For now, put green checkmarks â next to the first two items only - Personal Data and GnuPG.Step 9 - Reboot from the USB one last time. Now when the greeter presents you with ""More Optons"" (check NO as always) it also asks ""Enable Persistence?"" - check YES and enter the password.Now you can save files by storing them in the ""Persistence"" folder and also your pgp keys are not all lost at the end of every session","gpg: Signature made Mon 09 Dec 2013 10:50:48 PM UTC using RSA key ID BE2CD9C1

There are other types of metadata that can also betray your anonymity. Easiest way: Screenshot. If you're on Windows Vista/7, use that snipping tool. Don't leave a trace. If you're on Windows 8, there might be some similar app. If you're on Linux, do full screenshot then crop. If you're on Mac, get a real computer. Note that if you do full screenshot and crop, sometimes the software used to edit the image will be recorded in Metadata. If you use something very generic like M$ Paint then not too much problem. If you use a very specific one like Photoshop Version x.x.x then it could be used to identify you. Same thing with ""Select All and Paste"".

If you know how to use a hex editor, open the image in hex and you can even mislead LE by changing stuff into what you want them to believe. If you trust Python and know coding, use the exif.xxx() functions in Python. (Note that it only deals with exif. XMF and others are still there.) My personal favorite: install a very generic image editor and erase its name in regedit. The software name left behind in exif is the same as in your regedit so erase that and it shall be blank in your images. Bear in mind that the lack of evidence can be an evidence itself. If it's too clean, they know you used one of those few things that can actually clean it all.

"Utopia Forums","PolishBug","14","2013-12-28T22:16:18","Topic: True Crypt","UTOPIA MARKET FORUMS/Security / Safety","Copied from BMR, Credits to sh4d3r1950 ! What is TrueCrypt? TrueCrypt, for those who don't already know, is an encryption software for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It is basically a way of creating areas of your hard drive that are encrypted so that you can hide sensitive data and information there.Furthermore, you are able to encrypt your entire hard drive so that at boot, your computer will not be able to start without entering the correct password. This excerpt from TrueCrypt's website offers a more detailed explanation than I can provide: Documentation - TrueCrypt (truecrypt(dot)org/docs/) Why should I use TrueCrypt? TrueCrypt is a must for anyone doing anything illegal or blackhat through the use of a computer. Even if you are not participating in blackhat activities, there are still a plethora of reasons, limited only by your own creativity, as to why you would want to use TrueCrypt for privacy & safty. There is an interesting story going around about one individual that used TrueCrypt and avoided certain jail time because of it.For those that don't feel like reading it, basically the story is that this individual downloaded ""maybe 30"" CP images to see what it was like and ended up getting raided because of it. All of his computers were seized, and he was taken into custody. Upon analyzing his computer, they agents hit a dead end once they found that he had used whole drive encryption on all of his hardware.I'm sure there's more to the story that he has you believe about him not being involved in CP, but nevertheless, the story goes as on, & I am not much interested on CP or discuss the stories on that. this is just certain example for your idea & creativity, I gave here. Is using TrueCrypt illegal? In some countries, the use of encryption of any kind is illegal. This includes TrueCrypt. If you happen to live in one of these countries, are being charged with a cyber crime, and they find any encrypted contents on your hard drive, you can bet you're in for a rough time.They will physically beat the shit out of you and torture you into providing them with the password or key-files to the volume.Furthermore, it can even be illegal for you to transmit encrypted files from one country to another.I urge you to check up on the laws in your country and ensure that the methods outlined below are actually legal in your country and you're not just digging yourself a bigger hole. If you live in the European Union countries like UK, Germany, France, Austria, Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Romania... etc  few Asian Countries like Russia, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan... etc United States, Canada... TrueCrypt is legal, and the passwords for your archives are protected under the Amendments & law on computer privacy. Even if you live in a country where it is illegal, there are things you can do to use TrueCrypt a bit more safely. One example is to use a Hidden Archive. This is basically like a suitcase with a false bottom.One password - the one you would give to authority's if interrogated and tortured - will open the archive and display certain contents, while the second password will open the same archive but display different contents.However, this doesn't change the fact that using encryption is illegal if you are in such a country. My Disclaimer I sh4d3r1950 take no liability for consequences of using this tutorial - including hard drive failure, loss of data, and legal or illegal tongue action of any kind. Although I have striven to provide complete accuracy, and my time, this information is provided ""as is"" with no warranty. smile Alright,============= Lets get started =============== Download a copy of TrueCrypt for your system here (truecrypt(dot)org/downloads) Encrypting File Containers and System Drives To start with, you're going to need to download and install TrueCrypt from above link. Simply select your operating system.If you are going to be encrypting a flash drive or external hard drive with TrueCrypt that you want to take with you wherever you go, and use the flash drive on computers that don't have TrueCrypt installed, you'll need a portable version of TrueCrypt that can be found in the same installer. [I recommend you to install complete on your operating system not as portable] It is a clean download link. direct from TrueCrypt official webpage. Once installed, You can get it yourself by navigating to the directory you have TrueCrypt installed to, and copying all the files in that folder to your flash drive or external HD.Simply copy the folder to your flash drive and you will be able to mount any file after opening TrueCrypt.exeThere is another way to mount an encrypted flashdrive, but I'll go into that later. Creating an Encrypted File Container Use this method if all you want to do is create a file as big as you want with encrypted contents that can be stored anywhere, and then mounted as a drive letter through TrueCrypt. [just similar like a .iso file and you mount it later] Method #1 does not have the ""suitcase with a false bottom"" effect talked about earlier that Method #2 does. But both have their advantages and disadvantages. Method #1: No Hidden Archive 1. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed. Then select ""Create Volume"".2. From the three choices, select ""Create an encrypted file container""3. Click Next and then select ""Standard TrueCrypt Volume"".Click next again.4. Click ""Select File"" and navigate to the location on your hard drive where you want your volume to be, and specify a name for it.You actually have to give it a name, rather than just select a file. In my case for example, I simply named mine ""Volume 2"", as I already have a Volume 1 that I use.You can move and re-name this after it is created.5. Make sure that the box ""Never Save History Is Checked"". And click next.6. Choose your encryption and hash algorithms.All methods are very strong and you're safe with them all. You can just leave them as the defaults (AES & RIPEMD-160).7. Enter the size of the volume that you wish to create.8. Enter your desired password. Ideally, make it longer than 35 characters.I don't recommend using keyfiles, because they can get deleted and you will be unable to recover the data in the archive.Just use a really good password consisting of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.If you can't think of a password that is that long, try combining a few different passwords you may know, maybe a bank account number, some song lyrics, and keyboard configuration.Just basically anything that's going to get you to that length.This step is critical. Passwords are the biggest weakness.9. Next just move your mouse around randomly for as long as you have patience to do so, and then select format.10. Depending on the size of volume you chose to make, it may take a while to create a volume.11. That's it you're done! You have learned to create a ""simple encrypted container"" Method #2: File Container with Hidden Archive 1. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed, on the tabs at the top, select the drop-down menu ""Volumes""2. Click ""Create New Volume""3. From the three choices, select ""Create an encrypted file container""4. Click Next and then select ""Hidden TrueCrypt Volume"". Click next again.5. Select ""Normal Mode"" from the two options available.You can experiment with Direct Mode if you wish, but it requires you to have a volume already made, that you wish to convert into a hidden archive.6. Click ""Select File"" and navigate to the location on your hard drive where you want your volume to be, and specify a name for it.You actually have to give it a name, rather than just select a file.The name and location can be changed after creation.7. Click next to begin specifying the options for the outer volume.This is the part of the volume that you are going to be giving up to someone in case something very bad happens.Ideally you should still use a strong password, and posssibly keyfiles to make it look legitimate.8. Next click ""Open Outer Volume"" and put in some documents that are somewhat sensitive that you may have a legitimate reason to hide.Examples of this could be your bank account statements, a text file containing your own passwords, documents outlining how to make explosives. Use your imagination.But make sure that whatever you put in there isn't going to get you in too much trouble, but that it still explains your purpose for using TrueCrypt.9. Click next. Now we begin to specify the settings for the hidden volume. It is important that you make this one stronger than the first with regards to password length etc.10. Next specify the space you wish your archive to fill.You are limited to the difference of the space between what you initially made your Outer Volume, minus the contents you put in your Outer Volume. e.g. (Outer Volume Space - Contents of Outer Volume = Max Space Available for Hidden Archive).So it's important to make sure that your Outer Volume is initially created with an adequate size for both your Outer and Hidden Volumes.11. Next enter your password and use and key-files that you may want for your Hidden Archive. If you still haven't got it yet, you need to use a separate password for both your Outer and Hidden Volumes.12. Depending on the size of volume you chose to make, it may take a while to create a volume.13. And then you're done! now in #2 you have learned to create encrypted outer volume & hidden volume in a ""container"" For instructions on how to mount and use your TrueCrypt file container see refer to the section ""Mounting Your TrueCrypt Volumes"" Encrypting a USB Drive or Drive Partition 1. Insert the flash drive or connect the external hard drive to the computer.2. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed, on the tabs at the top, select the drop-down menu ""Volumes"".3. Click ""Create New Volume"".4. Select ""Encrypt a non-system partition/drive"".5. Select whether you'd like to create a standard or hidden TrueCrypt volume.If you don't understand what these are, refer to an earlier section.For this demonstration, we will be creating a standard volume.If you are creating a hidden volume on a USB or system drive, the steps are the same as creating a hidden file container.6. Hit next, and then click ""Select Device"". This will bring up a list of all the drives attached to the computer.7. Select the drive or partition that you wish to encrypt from the list.8. Now there are two options at this step.If you have data on the drive that you wish to preserve, select ""Encrypt partition in place"" - it will take longer, but nothing will be deleted.This only works on NTFS Drives.Alternatively, if you don't really care about anything on the drive, or make a backup you plan on moving in, you can select ""Create encrypted volume and format it"" - This will delete all data on the drive!9. Next select your encryption methods.10. Enter your desired password.Ideally, make it longer than 35 characters.I don't recommend using keyfiles, because they can get deleted and you will be unable to recover the data in the archive.Just use a really good password consisting of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.If you can't think of a password that is that long, try combining a few differnet passwords you may know, maybe a bank account number, some song lyrics, and keyboard configuration.Just basically anything that's going to get you to that length.This step is critical. Passwords are the biggest weakness.11. Next click ""Format"" a dialog box will appear notifying you that all data on the drive will be deleted. Click OK to continue formatting.12. Depending on the size of volume you chose to make, it may take a while to create a volume. And then you're done! For instructions on how to mount and use your TrueCrypt volume, refer to the section ""Mounting Your TrueCrypt Volumes"" Encrypting a System Partition or Entire System Drive This is the method you would use if you are interested in full drive encryption. You will need to have TrueCrypt installed on your computer in order to do this. At this time, you are unable to run TrueCrypt in portable mode to encrypt your whole computer. [Highly recommended by me] We are also not going to go into hidden operating system's and duel boot setup's right now, as there are many YouTube video tutorials and articles online that outline this beautifully, and it is beyond the scope of this tutorial, as there are many possibilities.With the instruction below, you will simply learn how to encrypt your whole hard drive to be decrypted upon boot after the correct password is entered.Furthermore, if you decide that full drive encryption is not for you, you may decrypt it permanently, and also change the password if you desire.It is good advice to back everything up onto external hard drives before using this method in case something goes bad, and you loose your data, but it is not necessary. In my experience, you will not notice your computer speed reduced at all by encrypting your entire hard drive. 1. Open TrueCrypt after you have it installed, and then click on ""Create Volume"".2. Select ""Encrypt the system partition or entire system drive"" and click next.3. Select ""Normal"" and click next. You are free to experiment with the any other options, but I recommend starting with a  normal archive just to get your feet wet.4. Now when selecting which area to encrypt, I recommend you just select ""Encrypt the whole drive"".You may choose the other one but the setup will change a little, and it is more for those with multi-boot setups.5. Next it will ask you whether you want to encrypt the ""Host Protected Area"".I recommend that you do not encrypt this (e.g. select NO), but again it is up to you to know whether your computer manufacturer uses these areas to store data or not.So assuming you selected No, click next to continue.6. Next click Single-Boot. Unless you have multiple operating systems and decide you want the other's encrypted as well.The majority of users here probably only have a single boot system.7. Now choose your encryption and hash algorithms. As noted earlier, all methods are very strong and you're safe with them all. You can just leave them as the defaults (AES & RIPEMD-160). If you wish to research more on the methods, and come to a conclusion on which is best, feel free to do so.8. Choose the password that you will use every time your computer is turned on.Do NOT forget this password. EVER.If you decide to change this later, you may. Also note that key-files are not supported for full drive encryption.9. Next just move your mouse around randomly for as long as you have patience to do so, and then select next.10. You will now have to create a ""Rescue Disk"" for three reasons that are outlined in the TrueCrypt dialog box.Please read over these steps and become familiar with them.The rescue disk will basically allow you to boot your operating system from a disk to repair it if something becomes damaged.Even if someone, including you, finds this disk, they will be unable to boot the computer without knowing the password. So again, DO NOT forget your password.So select the location where you want the save the ISO, and name the file.11. You will now need to burn this ISO to a disc.If you are confused about how to do this, or need software, just Google itI recommend PowerISO/UltraISO/ImgBurn/ImTooISO burner for burning ISO files.It can be found for download online [full versions contact me, PM me for custom listing on BMR]12. Upon successfully burning the ISO file to the disc, you can click next, and TrueCrypt will verify that you have done it correctly.13. Now you will have to decide what kind of Wipe Method you want to use.Depending on you computer's speed, and your patience, you can choose a different wipe method over another.This step basically help's keep the data secure and unrecoverable.Of course I recommend the Gutmann 35-pass method, but this is not appropriate for everyone. However, I suggest that you at least use SOME method of wipe.Please note that you will still be able to use your computer if you decide to use the Gutmann or DOD methods, it will simply run in the background when your computer is started until it finally finished wiping and encrypting.Just as an example, I have a 1TB hard drive, and when encrypting it, I used the Gutmann method. It took almost 4 days of running it non-stop on 8GB of RAM and an Intel 3rd gen quad 3.0 Ghz processor.14. After you have decided on a Wipe method, TrueCrypt will want to make sure everything is going to work properly in a System Encryption Pretest. Click Test.A dialog box will appear with instructions about what's going to happen, and what to do if something malfunctions.I recommend copying the contents of this to a text file and e-mailing it to yourself in case you need to read it from another computer.15. You will now have to restart your computer. Click ""Yes"" to restart.16. Upon booting up your computer, you will come to a black CMD screen which says ""TrueCrypt Boot Loader 7.0a - Enter Your Password"" etc.17. You will need to enter the password you chose here. It will then flash ""Booting"" across the screen and your operating system will be loaded like normal.18. Once your computer is booted, TrueCrypt will be loaded and it will tell you that the Pre-Test was completed successfully.Next click Encrypt to start encrypting. It will give you another dialog box pop-up. It is a good idea to copy this down in a text file and e-mail it to yourself like the last set of instructions.19. Now it will start encrypting your hard drive.Depending on whether you chose a wipe method or not, and how large your hard drive is, this can take anywhere from an hour or so all the way up to weeks before it completes.As explained earlier, you can still use your computer while this process works in the background.20. After it is done encrypting, TrueCrypt will now tell you that it has completed the encryption successfully. Hit ""OK"", and then finish. ================ now lets learn mounting steps =============== Mounting Your TrueCrypt Volumes Now that you've made your TrueCrypt volumes, you may be wondering, well how the hell do I access these super-duper-highly-secure-and-encrypted volumes?This depends on the type of drive you created earlier that you are trying to mount. We will run over the three different types. Mounting an Encrypted File Container The method is the same for mounting both hidden and normal volumes.If you wish to mount either the public or hidden portion of a hidden archive, simply use the different password that you specified while creating your volume. 1. Open TrueCrypt and select the drive letter that you wish to mount your volume to.2. Click ""Select File"" and navigate to the location that you have your file container at and select your container. Then click open.3. Next click ""Mount"", with the drive letter you want your volume to be mounted as.4. You will be prompted to enter your password, and load any key-files that you may have used. Leave the box ""Cache passwords and keyfiles in memory"" unchecked.After loading any keyfiles, and/or entering your password, click OK.5. You will now see your drive mounted under ""My Computer"" and TrueCrypt as the drive that you selected when you mounted it.You may choose any available drive from letters A-Z.6. It now act's like a normal drive. You can cut, copy, paste anything to and from the drive.7. When you are done with the archive, you may dismount it.8. Dismount the drive by ensuring that every process or location utilizing that drive is first closed to prevent damage to the volume.9. Next, select the drive from TrueCrypt, and select Dismount. The drive will disappear from TrueCrypt and from My Computer Mounting a USB Drive or Encrypted Drive Partition There are two ways to use TrueCrypt with a USB/Flash Drive/External Hard Drive. â¢ Encrypt the entire drive so that there is no empty space left on it.- This is the method outlined earlier under ""Encrypting a USB Drive or Encrypted Drive Partition"".It will require you to have TrueCrypt installed on the computer that you are trying to mount the removable media to. â¢ Create an encrypted file folder large (or small) enough to fit onto the flash drive or external hard drive.- It allows you to actually have TrueCrypt on the removable device so that it's contents may be mounted wherever you are. I highly recommend this method over the first for removable storage like USB drives but not for External HD.If using this method, the way to mount the drive is exactly the same as mounting an Encrypted File Container because, well, that's exactly what it is. But, for external HDs I recommend Encrypt entire HD with hidden volume If you have decided to encrypt your entire external hard drive or flash drive, then you will need to follow a slightly different set of instructions which is outlined below. Remember that for this way, you need to have TrueCrypt installed on the computer in order to mount the volume. 1. Open up TrueCrypt, and this time, instead of clicking ""Select File"", click ""Select Device"".2. Have your device (USB/External HD) already connected to the computer.3. Next select your device from the list of available devices and partitions, then click OK.4. From here on out it is just like mounting a file container. If you initially created a hidden folder on your device/drive, you can enter a differnet password to get to that area of the drive.5. It will then become visible under TrueCrypt, and My Computer, as the drive letter that you specified for it when mounting.6. To dismount, make sure all folders and processes utilizing the drive are closed, then simply highlight the drive in TrueCrypt and select ""Dismount"". Mounting a System Partition or Entire System Drive This is the easiest drive to mount. Once you turn on the computer with the encrypted hard drive, you will be prompted to enter the password at a command line looking screen.Upon entering the correct password, your operating system will boot. If you wish to disable TrueCrypt in the task bar after booting your system, follow these steps:1. Open TrueCrypt, and under settings, at the top, select preferences.2. Uncheck the box ""Start TrueCrypt Background Task"" under ""Actions to perform upon logon to windows""3. Click OK and then Exit. Restart to see the changes take place. You will notice that TrueCrypt no longer is in the task manager, and that it is not running in the processes under Task Manager Useful Tips and Tricks â¢ Tip #1: When working with detected files, malware in particular, it can often times be frustrating when your Anti-Virus deletes the files that you are using.To avoid this problem, add an exclusion in your Anti-Virus as an entire drive letter, such as drive Z:\. Then create a TrueCrypt file container, and inside the TrueCrypt volume, keep all the files that are detected, along with all your hacking material.Mount this file container as that drive letter you added to your exclusions list in your AntiVirus.This keeps all of your sensitive files safe from prying eyes, and allows you to scan your entire computer for infections, with the TrueCrypt volume dismounted, without worrying about false positives.Nothing gets in, and nothing gets out, without your permission. â¢ Tip #2: Think about setting up a Virtual Machine that you do alot of your hacking from, and keep this in a TrueCrypt container.This will make it so that some of the temporary files, time, and system logs that Windows and other operating systems keep are never found, and there will be no evidence, or time log against you in case of a lawsuit.You can use your normal operating system, but you need to be good at deleting your logs using a secure deletion method. I recommend five main things to stay safe. First, use a VPN + Socks/RAT proxy to Hide Your Ass and avoid being aprehended in the first place.Truecrypt is your second line of defense.And if you decide, your third line of defense is a hidden file container. Secondly, you must have whole drive encryption. I don't care if you have multi-booting operating systems or not, but whole drive encryption is a must! Third, I recommend that you keep everything that is hacking related or otherwise illegal locked inside a highly secure file container on your encrypted hard drive somewhere. Make this container as big as you need. double protection. Fourth, use a strong password! I'm talking dozens of characters long. I gave some hints earlier about how you can memorize a password of this length. DO NOT write it down. Fifth, if you are not going to reformat your entire hard drive, wipe the data, and start over with a clean slate, which I recommend - nothing beats a fresh reformat, then you need to wipe down the free space of your hard drive using a secure deletion method. Lastly, I took much time writing, editing, formatting & posting it here for BMR users to stay safe. have some pity on my private time spent on this. just worth my effort fellows.

But it is based on internet spread rumors and not facts. Of course it is very possible that the Government bought out Symantec PGP and installed their backdoor on it.  But they could and may have done that with any PGP program out in the market. The US Government has the resources to  buy any and all the GPG, PGP, GPA, whatever, etc. encryption program on the market.  They have the resources to create a program or any program and put it out there as a trap.  They have the resources to promote programs, and to spread rumors about legit programs. I'm sure that most LE ""Cyber Crimes"" divisions are now very well funded to whatever they want. So, what makes any of these programs legit?  I would say go for the ones that have open source codes.  These are the only ones that can be checked and rechecked by the technical community.

You are correct that the VPN service wont be able to monitor what you do WITHIN the TOR Browser, but it ""could"" collect your source ISP IP and also any Exit Node details.  This statement also applies to regular ISP's - i.e,  if you ONLY used Tor directly with no VPN at all...your ISP would not see within the Tor Browser but could collect certain details......again not recommended for Exit Node information, etc. The main (important) difference by connecting to Tor and then Tunneling your VPN through your TOR socks proxy....is that your VPN service will NEVER see your real ISP IP address and any Exit Nodes will be referenced to your torified VPN IP address which is hidden/useless to your ISP / VPN providers. Your ISP will only ever be able to divulge your TOR IP connection (which changes) and your VPN service will appear invisible (i.e. it will only ever be connected WITHIN TOR).  Essentially, it's prevents your ISP from seeing a link between your ISP's IP address to your chosen VPN service address (whether it's logged or not).  - TOR gives you ANONYMITY.- VPN gives you PRIVACY. It's always best to go ANONYMOUS (Tor) first and then enable your Privacy (VPN) through that anonymous network. If you enable Privacy (VPN) first and then enable Anonymity (Tor) second, you leave a trail from your ISP to your VPN service which is simply a link best NOT to have on your ISP logs.  You end up placing ALL your trust in the VPN provider.

Until this morning I did not know even about the risk of using a VPN ***prior*** to launching Tor.  I have now read up on this and am shocked that this particular risk is not highlighted very clearly to users of marketplaces everywhere. I found this info at ""Tor & VPN"" http://ysas7uv4drg7rlwv.onion/viewtopic â¦ 9250#p9250 and from the posters signature, I was able to do the guide to update my PGP from 1024 to 4096!! (I have read that 2048 is able to be hacked??) Link to the guide I used: http://ysas7uv4drg7rlwv.onion/viewtopic.php?id=658 After initially feeling dumb as fuck and more than paranoid.I started importing others public PGP keys and noticed that the site admins (of all people) are only using 1024 and 2048 bit encryption! SWIM = 2048bitJlaw = 1024bitDarkGL = 2048bitILS = 2048bit This initially made me feel better about me slacking.....but then i thought if it only took me 10 mins to go to 4096bit, then why wouldn't site admins? C'mon Leaders - lead by example - increase your PGP to 4096 and perhaps post a sticky to explain that VPN then Tor is BAD BAD BAD BAD. First and last post from me (over my Tor THEN vpn connection). inormallydontdoforums",""

This is simply not true.    Tor based tumblers are only used for illegal activities, buying drugs being the least worrisome of them. So if you are buying drugs at best you are exchanging with other people buying drugs, which accomplishes nothing. At worst you are exchanging with people buying CP which now connects you to a worse crime. So people tumbling to buy drugs are paying a fee to cover for people doing worse crimes.    LE has never used their resources to actively used the blockchain information to track down and arrest buyers. If this was going to be done, it would have been done after SR1 was taken down, but its simply not worth it to them to arrest drug users. They want big headlines to justify their massive budgets, they like pictures of officers standing next to stacks of money and drugs so tracking down buyers would be a waste of resources.    Tumbling can be accomplished better and cheaper without Tor tumblers. If you did actually want to 'tumble' your coins, it would be better to move it to a BTC exchange and make a few trades. You could exchange your coins with people using their BTC to buy things legitimately for ~0.5-1% depending on the number of trades. This is more effective and cheaper than the average costs of 4% on tor tumblers.    If someone has the resources to track your transactions through the blockchain, it is unlikely the techniques implemented by the tumblers would be effective.If you disagree, or think I overlooked something please share it but right now I see no rational reason anyone would use BitcoinFog or similar services.;maxhavelaar - great quality at the sharpest prices.Marijuana - MDMA - Germany Domestic Shipment  Profile: Utopia torchat: h37jwquycc7thqj6"

As chinks in the armour of such encryption systems go the one exploited by Forensic Disk Decryptor is small but potentially useful to forensic engineers in some circumstances. Normally, a volume (or smaller container) encrypted by one of these software programs is secured using a password, which canât be broken using any known brute-forcing attack as long as it is long and complex enough. However, according to Elcomsoft when this password has been entered and the volume âopenedâ the keys to access the volume and its files are kept in memory as âdumps or (where the PC has entered hibernation), as âhibernationâ files. These temporary files allow access to the key used to secure the volumes if the target PC is discovered in its powered state or in a state of hibernation. Files can also be retrieved from a system that has been turned off as long as the PC entered hibernation while the volume was open prior to being powered down. In summary, files encrypted with BitLocker, PGP and Truecrypt are safe from this product as long as volumes are opened or mounted and then closed and demounted in an orderly way; doing this destroys the insecure memory dump. For extra safety, hibernation should be disabled. For the record, ElcomSoft doesnât explain in detail how it finds and analyses the memory dumps used to retrieve the encryption key, although the company does admit the technique â specifically via FireWire - isnât particularly new, just infrequently discussed. âThe new product includes algorithms allowing us to analyze dumps of computersâ volatile memory, locating areas that contain the decryption keys,â said ElcomSoftâs CEO, Vladimir Katalov, in a blog on the new software.  âSometimes the keys are discovered by analyzing byte sequences, and sometimes by examining crypto containersâ internal structures. When searching for PGP keys, the user can significantly speed up the process if the exact encryption algorithm is known.â Given that the software costs $299 (around Â£190) a license, its capabilities are likely to appeal to professional forensic analysts working for police forces. Such individuals need a means of accessing encrypted data without altering the information in a way that would cause problems in subsequent prosecutions. Elcomsoft has a long track record of picking up on the weaknesses in encryption and other security systems, including the iPhone, BlackBerryâs data archive, and even Canonâs digital camera image verification system.","Wtf is (Insert Here)"
