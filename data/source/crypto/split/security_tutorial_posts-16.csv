If you see a single certificate error when you are not expecting it (if you don't know then assume you are not expecting it) then please :  1) Hit ""New Identity"" in Tor - this will give you a different exit node 2) Log out of the site (by hitting logout) that was affected - just to kill any session data just in case 3) Log back in to the affected site - possibly change your password if you are unsure ",""

In that case you don't get a certificate error because the connection is simply downgraded to HTTP and you must be observant of that in the URL bar. In a few versions of Firefox the beginning of the URL bar would be blue for SSL/TLS connections but now it's more subtle, simply showing a gray lock with the https:// part visible while http:// is hidden on non-encrypted connections.

What are your thoughts on this?","BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its security and stability. The major BSD projects include FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD, with a number of tangential projects including pfSense, FreeNAS and PC-BSD. BSD software such as OpenSSH is the default communication tool for innumerable devices on the internet. BSD software is renowned for its internet infrastructure role since its earliest days.The Tor Project continues to play a critical component in anonymity and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship, Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since originating with the US Naval Labs in the 1990âs. Hundreds of thousands rely on Torâs operation in a world filled with threats to anonymity and privacy.While recognizing that the Tor Project is dynamic open source project with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achillesâ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. Diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.There are three aspects of the TDPâs approach:    to increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs, focused on the server/network layer    to develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer    to engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity networkCurrent TDP work includes:    guides for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays    the creation of an OpenBSD Tor Browser port    organizing various events for engaging BSD users about Tor, including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetingsWe look forward to inquiries and involvement in TDP. Please use this contact form for any communications."

Lizard Squad, which took credit for denial of service attacks that kept Xbox Live and PlayStation Network offline over Christmas, tweeted earlier today that it was going after the Tor encryption service.      To clarify, we are no longer attacking PSN or Xbox. We are testing our new Tor 0day.     â Lizard Squad (@LizardMafia) December 26, 2014  Earlier today, Tor's service was flooded with new relays â the routers that users' data is passed between in order to make it untraceable â with the name LizardNSA. ""Hi, do you guys still give away shirts for relay owners? We need about 3000,"" Lizard Squad bragged on Twitter. A member of Reddit's Technology board noted the influx, and security researcher Nadim Kobeissi posted a similar shot.      This is what the Tor network looks like right now. pic.twitter.com/0QQAGVTRRI     â Nadim Kobeissi (@kaepora) December 26, 2014  Kobeissi, who developed the chat client Cryptocat, pointed to metrics that showed ""LizardNSA"" relays made up a significant part of the network. ""Currently there's actually almost 10,000 relays, about 3,000 to 6,000 of those seem to be Lizard Squad's,"" he said over email. Theoretically, a group that controls enough of these nodes could track the traffic over them, compromising users' anonymity. The tactic of creating malicious relays isn't a new one; earlier this year, Tor reported that an unknown attacker had potentially captured some user data by setting up about 100 of them.  In a conversation on Twitter, Kobeissi and security researcher Frederic Jacobs expressed some concern, but the implications of all these new nodes aren't clear yet. ""The attack won't be effective unless Lizard Squad's relays obtain enough consensus with the rest of the network, which is currently not happening due to the newness of the relays and their low bandwidth allowance,"" says Kobeissi. According to an explanation from Tor last year, new relays are initially capped at a very low bandwidth of about 20 KB/s, which means that they get ""basically no use"" for the first three days.  Lizard Squad, which supposedly halted its gaming network attacks after being offered gift vouchers by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, has not elaborated on its intentions for Tor, although its Twitter bio currently reads ""I cry when Tor deserves to die."" We've contacted Tor for comment but did not immediately receive a response.  http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/26/7451293/lizard-squad-hackers-set-sights-on-tor-network  Stay Safe everyone  ",""

They wouldn't dare take down the tor network, especially considering sp3c1alist and most of the other DKode use it, themselves.  ""Hacking"" it is not really what they're doing.

"The Hub Forums","DarknetMarkets","9993.0","2015-06-14T00:51:56","Confused with Blockchain > Helix Mixer > DM's","Start Here/For Beginners","I would also recommend a VPN.  You should be alright with the way you sent your coins, but if you plan on ordering regularly and value anonymity over about 5-10 minutes of extra time spent on each order, I would suggest doing something more like this (for several reasons I will explain below):  I will describe this using blockchain.info for the wallets in this example as that is what OP is using, but you can do the exact same thing with electrum or whatever wallet you are comfortable with.  1- Create a wallet on the blockchain.info clearnet site. (wallet #1)  2- Buy Bitcoins, send them to wallet #1.  3- Create a second wallet using Blockchain.info's hidden service. (wallet #2) NOTE: Always double check that you are using the correct link for this and every hidden service, as malware and phishing sites abound. Also make sure that you never use the blockchain.info clearnet url over tor; doing that opens you up another possible vulnerability (malicious tor exit nodes).   Blockchain.info hidden service URL is: https://blockchainbdgpzk.onion/ Secure short link (maintained by us): https://drk.li/BC  4- Send your bitcoins from wallet #1 directly to wallet #2. The reason for this is to add plausible deniability between your clearnet wallet and in-person purchases. If you are ever investigated by LE, or the company from which you are buying coins (happens with Coinbase.com especially), you can reasonably claim that you sent them to someone else who controlled wallet #2 for whatever made-up reason you have in mind as your excuse for your BTC purchase. After that you have no idea/don't care what that person did with them, nor should anyone expect you to.  5- Create a third wallet, also using blockchainbdgpzk.onion. (wallet #3).  6- Pick your mixer and set up your transaction there, using the address(s) from wallet #3.  We recommend Helix by Grams and then Bitmixer as the two seemingly best in a group of imperfect options. They have both been extremely reliable so far while processing millions of dollars. DO NOT use blockchain.info's shared send or any other coinjoin product as your mixer, as it does not hide your trail like the others.  Helix Grams URL: http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix Secure short link: https://drk.li/Helix Helix light (no account needed): https://drk.li/HelixLight  NOTE: Turn off JavaScript before doing this step if you are using HELIX, bitcoinfog, or bitcoinblender. (""S"" icon before address bar in the tor browser, then >Forbid Scripts Globally"".)  Sadly Bitmixer still requires users to have javascript enabled.  Save the ""Letter of Guarantee"" if you are using bitmixer, if you are using helix save the URL it sends you to after you enter your address(s).  7) Go back to blockchainbdgpzk.onion, and select the ""Temporarily allow all this page"" option from the NoScript icon. Now log in to wallet #2, and send to the coins to the address generated by your mixing page.    If you don't already have your market deposit address, log in and get it while having JavaScript disabled. Never use any market that requires you to enable JS.  9) Log out of your market account, ideally close and restart the tor browser. Now go back to blockchainbdgpzk.onion again, turn JS back on (""Temporarily allow all this page""), and then send the coins to your market address.   The reason you should create an extra wallet in between your mixer and market account, is in case you ever run in to any type of problem with your account (lost password, hacked/phished, lost PGP key etc), you can use the fact that you control all of the recent deposit address as proof that you are the rightful owner of this account.  You should also create a wallet you control in between any coins you may ever withdrawal from a market, and a mixer. This is in case the market takes a long time to put your deposit through (which happens, trust me). Mixers only keep track of the addresses it generates for you for a set amount of time, usually about 24 hours I think. If you initiate a withdrawal from a market directly to a mixer's bitcoin address, and the market runs into problems and doesn't send your withdrawal for say 48 hours, you face a very real risk of the mixer not forwarding your coins. This would not be the mixer's fault, as they are open about how they work. They purge records every X hours for privacy.  I probably made this sound more complicated than it actually is. All in it should only take about 10 minutes of you actually doing things, and it is worth doing if you value your privacy and want to make sure you never lose any coins!  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have or suggest any alternatives that may be better!",""

Taken (unneccessary information removed for this post) from bitcoin blender's home page.  1. Why Mix Your Coins  3. Other Methods  5. Mix in, Mix out  ::: 1. Why Mix Your Coins :::  Using Bitcoin does not protect your anonymity. This is because Bitcoin works on a public ledger, meaning anyone anywhere can see and follow every transaction you ever make. From the moment you buy your coins, to the moment you cash them out... they can be followed. And if anything along the way can be linked to your identity - for example if you bought or sold using your bank account, face to face with cash, or even using a voucher from a store with CCTV - then an agency with the right tools could theoretically find you without much trouble. Classic examples of people who might follow your online activity and reveal your identity, are Law Enforcement Agencies, somebody with a grudge, or hackers who have noticed you are moving large amounts of money around.  But by 'mixing' your Bitcoins, you are essentially breaking the link between your identity and your transactions - Bitcoin Blender lets you prevent Blockchain Analysis by swapping your coins for somebody else's. In other words, you deposit your coins into one 'pot', and we send you coins from another 'pot', breaking the chain.   ::: 3. Other Methods :::  There are several ways of 'mixing' your coins, however many of these do not provide the same protection against Blockchain Analysis as Bitcoin Blender (and other similar hidden services).  Perhaps the most common method aside from using a hidden service mixer like Bitcoin Blender, is the Coin Join method found on services such as Shared Coin. The way this method works is by attaching your transaction to a number of other transactions, thereby making it difficult to tell which has gone where. And although this method does help maintain a certain degree of anonymity, it still provides a level of 'taint' for somebody experienced in Blockchain Analysis. 'Taint' can be seen as the trail your transaction leaves behind, and although techniques used by services like Shared Coin certainly blur that trail, they do not remove it completely - for best results, you should find a service that sends you coins from a completely different 'pot'.  5. Mix In, Mix Out Your 'buy in' and 'buy out' are the most vulnerable parts of your transaction trail, as they are the most likely points that you will be identified. If you do not wish your transactions to be followed, mix all coins you buy before you spend them, then mix anything you withdraw again on their way back out.","Can someone explain what's tumbling? in fact I need a guide on how to buy things in the dark we with bitcoins... how to make them anonymous and stuff like that.

"The Hub Forums","Vixty","8583.0","2015-04-28T19:48:02","Tor Browser 4.5 is released","General Discussion/Security","Update now   There are a lot of new stuff in this update that I really like  The Tor Browser Team is proud to announce the first stable release in the 4.5 series. This release is available from the Tor Browser Project page and also from our distribution directory.  The 4.5 series provides significant usability, security, and privacy enhancements over the 4.0 series. Because these changes are significant, we will be delaying the automatic update of 4.0 users to the 4.5 series for one week.  On the usability front, we've improved the application launch experience for both Windows and Linux users. During install, Windows users are now given the choice to add Tor Browser to the Start Menu/Applications view, which should make it easier to find and launch. This choice is on by default, but can be disabled, and only affects the creation of shortcuts - the actual Tor Browser is still self-contained as a portable app folder. On the Linux side, users now start Tor Browser through a new wrapper that enables launching from the File Manager, the Desktop, or the Applications menu. The same wrapper can also be used from the command line.  We've also simplified the Tor menu (the green onion) and the associated configuration windows. The menu now provides information about the current Tor Circuit in use for a page, and also provides an option to request a new Tor Circuit for a site. Tor Browser is also much better at handling Tor Circuits in general: while a site remains in active use, all associated requests will continue to be performed over the same Tor Circuit. This means that sites should no longer suddenly change languages, behaviors, or log you out while you are using them.  On the security front, the most exciting news is the new Security Slider. The Security Slider provides user-friendly vulnerability surface reduction - as the security level is increased, browser features that were shown to have a high historical vulnerability count in the iSec Partners hardening study are progressively disabled. This feature is available from the Tor onion menu's ""Privacy and Security Settings"" choice.  Our Windows packages are now signed with a hardware signing token graciously donated by DigiCert. This means that Windows users should no longer be prompted about Tor Browser coming from an unknown source. Additionally, our automatic updates are now individually signed with an offline signing key. In both cases, these signatures can be reproducibly removed, so that builders can continue to verify that the packages they produce match the official build binaries.  The 4.5 series also features a rewrite of the obfs2, obfs3, and ScrambleSuit transports in GoLang, as well as the introduction of the new obfs4 transport. The obfs4 transport provides additional DPI and probing resistance features which prevent automated scanning for Tor bridges. As long as they are not discovered via other mechanisms, fresh obfs4 bridge addresses will work in China today. Additionally, barring new attacks, private obfs4 addresses should continue to work indefinitely.  On the privacy front, the 4.5 series improves on our first party isolation implementation to prevent third party tracking. Specifically, blob: URIs are now scoped to the URL bar domain that created them, and the SharedWorker API has been disabled to prevent cross-site and third party communication. We also now make full use of Tor's circuit isolation to ensure that all requests for any third party content included by a site travel down the same Tor Circuit. This isolation also ensures that requests to the same third party site actually use separate Tor Circuits when the URL bar domain is different. This request isolation is enforced even when long-lived ""HTTP Keep-Alive"" connections are used.  We have also improved our resolution and locale fingerprinting defenses, and we now disable the device sensor and video statistics APIs.  Our default search provider has also been changed to Disconnect.  Here is the complete list of changes in the 4.5 series since 4.0:      All Platforms         Update Tor to 0.2.6.7 with additional patches:             Bug 15482: Reset timestamp_dirty each time a SOCKSAuth circuit is used          Update NoScript to 2.6.9.22         Update HTTPS-Everywhere to 5.0.3             Bug 15689: Resume building HTTPS-Everywhere from git tags          Update meek to 0.17         Include obfs4proxy 0.0.5             Use obfs4proxy for obfs2, obfs3, obfs4, and ScrambleSuit bridges          Pluggable Transport Dependency Updates:             Bug 15265: Switch go.net repo to golang.org/x/net             Bug 15448: Use golang 1.4.2 for meek and obs4proxy          Update Tor Launcher to 0.2.7.4.

You know how your Tor makes a circuit with 3 relays to connect to a clearnet website? Well, when you connect to a hidden service, you actually make a circuit (3 relays) to a rendezvous point in the middle, and the hidden service makes a circuit (3 relays) to the same rendezvous point. That's why you can see 3 relays (known) that you use, and 3 relays (unknown) that the hidden service uses to hide.  Hope this helps.

It was discovered by Abdul Alhazred, when he explored the ideas of non-euclidean 3-space, after Poincare and Yogthoth.  You have to be a hell of a mathemetician to follow it, but I'll give it my best explanation.  It involves multi-dimensional n-themes that can be tri-plexed against orthogonal isomorphs.  Basically, it stems from the current derivation of the real numbers using Dedekind Cuts and Eudoxus Reals in mathematical analysis.   It goes something like this:  When we say that any two models of the above axioms are isomorphic, we mean that for any two models (R, 0R, 1R, +R, ÃR, â¤R) and (S, 0S, 1S, +S, ÃS, â¤S), there is a bijection f : R â S preserving both the field operations and the order. Explicitly, f is both injective and subjective. f(0R) = 0S and f(1R) = 1S. For all x and y in R, f(x +R y) = f(x) +S f(y) and f(x ÃR y) = f(x) ÃS f(y). For all x and y in R, x â¤R y if and only if f(x) â¤S f(y).  That's the first part, which is used to build the basic fachigol properties (associative, distributive, etc).  Then, beginning again: Let R be the set of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. That is, sequences x1, x2, x3,... of rational numbers such that for every rational Îµ > 0, there exists an integer N such that for all natural numbers m,n > N, |xm â xn| < Îµ. Here the vertical bars denote the absolute value.  Cauchy sequences (xn) and (yn) can be added and multiplied as follows:  (xn) + (yn) = (xn + yn) (xn) Ã (yn) = (xn Ã yn).  Then, from Poincarian Homological Spheres, bear the following in mind: 1) Reconstruction on a knot in the 3-sphere S3 with framing +1 or â 1 gives a homology sphere.  2) Or, More generally, r on a link gives a homology sphere whenever the matrix given by intersection numbers (off the diagonal) and framings (on the diagonal) has determinant +1 or â1.  3) If p, q, and r are pairwise relatively prime positive integers then the link of the singularity xp + yq + zr = 0 (in other words, the intersection of a small 5-sphere around 0 with this complex surface) is a homology 3-sphere, called a Brieskorn 3-sphere Î£(p, q, r). It is homeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere if one of p, q, and r is 1, and Î£(2, 3, 5) is the PoincarÃ© sphere.  4) The connected sum of two oriented homology 3-spheres is a homology 3-sphere. A homology 3-sphere that cannot be written as a connected sum of two homology 3-spheres is called irreducible or prime, and every homology 3-sphere can be written as a connected sum of prime homology 3-spheres in an essentially unique way. (See Prime decomposition (3-manifold).)  5) Suppose that a1, ..., ar are integers all at least 2 such that any two are coprime. Then the Seifert fiber space {b, (o1,0);(a1,b1),....,(ar,br)}, over the sphere with exceptional fibers of degrees a1, ..., ar is a homology sphere, where the b's are chosen so that: b+b1/a1+....+br/ar=1/(a1....ar). (There is always a way to choose the bâ²s, and the homology sphere does not depend (up to isomorphism) on the choice of bâ²s.)   If r is at most 2 this is just the usual 3-sphere; otherwise they are distinct non-trivial homology spheres. If the aâ²s are 2, 3, and 5 this gives the PoincarÃ© sphere. If there are at least 3 aâ²s, not 2, 3, 5, then this is an acyclic homology 3-sphere with infinite fundamental group that has a Thurston geometry modeled on the universal cover of SL2.  Most of this is available on Wikipedia and the Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy Online. Falcighol changed his name after world war II, which is why its so hard to find.

In the meantime, the operators of the phishing site used the information to login to the real Silk Road site, and clean out the user's wallet.

That said, according to evidence produced at trial, Ross was a very heavy TorChat user, and one has to wonder about some of the comments made above, e.g. inability to refuse file downloads, etc.   Zaphod  ","Should torchat users worry about this kind of thing?;     Torchatâs security is unknown. It has not undergone a proper security audit, professional or otherwise, that I know of. It creates a hidden service on your computer leaving you vulnerable to deanonymization attacks that apply to all hidden services. It also seems to be a very basic protocol that looks like netcat over Tor. There is no way to decline a file transfer. It automatically starts the transfer, writing the file to /tmp which is a RAM-mounted tmpfs on Linux. Then you are supposed to save the file somewhere. Theoretically an attacker could transfer /dev/urandom while you are away from your computer until it fills up your RAM and crashes your computer. This would be great for inducing intersection attacks. Not sure though. If the kernel is managing the system correctly, it may just stop the transfer when you run out of RAM.    Another thing is that once someone learns your Torchat ID there is no way to prevent them from knowing you are online, even if you remove them from your buddy list. The reason is because your Torchat instance is a hidden service that publishes a normal hidden service descriptor which anyone can download. Thereâs no way to stop that. If you want to cut off contact with someone, you have to get a new Torchat ID. So you should be very conservative about handing out your Torchat ID and only give it to extremely trusted associates.

I said that I thought it had to do with him being a control-freak -- if everyone used PGP, he wouldn't have been able to snoop on whatever he liked. I think this was a control thing, like the record keeping was a control thing.   He also didn't understand the technology he was using. One of the things I've preached about is using layered security; if one layer fails, the second will still provide protection. He could have kept his records conventionally-encrypted with a Diceware passphrase he kept only in his head. Even in the event that his laptop was snatched away, they would not have been able to decrypt those files. When the first layer of security failed, there was no second layer.   He could have also aged-out/destroyed his PGP encryption sub-keys, if the software he had used had generated any. (He used Kleopatra to generate his PGP keys, and Kleopatra is notorious for not generating encryption sub-keys.) This could have provided forward secrecy. I know of one person who wanted to teach him these techniques, but he was completely and totally uninterested -- he thought he knew better.   This person and I laughed at Ross's idiocy, and this guy said, ""You know, you and I are going to be free long after Ross is in jail,"" and tht is precisely how it's turned out.

Re-using keys/identities across multiple sites just makes it easier for the authorities to build a dossier on you. Consider this: it's hard enough, over a very long period of time, to remember what you've said on one site alone -- multiply this by a half-dozen (or a dozen) sites, and you begin to appreciate the magnitude of the problem. All it takes, sometimes, is one little remark to give you away -- that one piece of the puzzle, that one little piece of information.  This means, if you're using a consistent identity/PGP keypair across multiple sites, that a mistake made on one system, may bring down the entire house of cards.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","277.0","2014-01-29T16:24:42","Tumbling Coins","General Discussion/Security"," Yes, if you are tumbling 100 Bitcoin, and the Fog takes 1-3 Bitcoins, that is a large amount to take. The upside of course being that you can deposit 100, and take it out in different amounts. 10 + 15 + 20 + 17 + 23 + 12 = 98 into different wallets. With Shared Send you cannot do it like this to the best of my knowledge. The downside though, is once you take it out from Bitcoin Fog, it is obvious that it came from BitCoin Fog.  So it seems like the most optimal, yet expensive way would be to first send from yourself to the Fog using Shared Send. Then after withdrawing from the Fog, forward to another address(es) using Shared Send again to break the link between the final wallet and Shared Send which also helps you break up the 100 Bitcoin into smaller amounts. This can get expensive though.","Personally I prefer BCI's shared send service over Fog - easy on the fees and takes way less time.. The only caveat is that.. since the service needs to match your deposited amount with someone elses on the network.. Only nice round figures work well for quick transactions. As then these coins can be swapped multiple times breaking the chain and leaving no trail. Fogs minimum 6hrs turnaround is not a luxury some people have, all the more considering how volatile the BTC prices are. They're like a casino, where the house always wins - no matter what.. so any fluctuations between market value from time sent to time received is theirs for the taking. Besides their prices are outrages if dealt in larger values."

Lavaboom:   ""Only German agencies are authorised to issue warrants for individual user information but these must be approved by the German high court. If a warrant was approved we would not be able to hand over the plain text emails as only the user has access to their private key.""  Hushmail:   Does HushMail have a ""back door"" that can be accessed by government agencies?  No. Email, which includes attachments, sent between Hush users is completely encrypted.  What if my message is subpoenaed?  Hush will answer valid, court-issued subpoenas. However, if the mail is fully encrypted, the subpoenaed version will not resemble the original text version.   Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20010215014607/http://www.hushmail.com/about_hushmail/faq/#gq33  From Hushmail's FAQ in 2002 -- note the change in wording to make their claims more explicit:   Does HushMail have a ""back door"" that can be accessed by government agencies?  No. Email, which includes attachments, sent between Hush users is completely encrypted.  What if my message is subpoenaed?  Hush, like any company or individual, is legally bound to respond to court-issued subpoenas. However, because not even Hush can access the encryption keys of individual users,  in the case of a subpoena Hush would only be able to provide the encrypted (coded) version of the transmitted email.  Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20020403213419/http://www.hushmail.com/about_hushmail/faq/#messagesubponaed  Other claims Lavaboom makes are also similar to Hushmail's. Hushmail said they would only accept subpoenas from the British Columbia courts -- all others would be ignored.   Lavaboom is claiming that only requests from the German authorities will be honored.  Let me remind you how the DEA got around Hush's requirement that an order from a B.C. court would be required -- they used the MLAT agreement between Canada and the U.S. (MLAT stands for the Mutual Law enforcement Assistance Treaty). Under the auspices of MLAT, the DEA got the American government to ask the Canadian Minister of Justice for assistance, and under the terms of MLAT, the Canadian Minister of Justice asked the B.C. courts to issue an order for the data the DEA wanted. It is believed that the order was written in such a way that Hush would have been found in contempt of court if the plaintext (i.e. non-encrypted) data were not supplied, so Hush had to come up with a method for achieving this.  They did this by giving each customer email named in the warrant a modified Java applet -- this applet was designed to capture the user's passphrase and/or private key. I believe something similar could occur with Lavaboom.   Hushmail ended up turning over in excess of 100,000  decrypted emails to the DEA.   Now, to be fair, there are differences in the methods used by Lavaboom and those (still) used by Hushmail. That said, I'm still not convinced that these differences will be significant enough to avoid a similar outcome.

"The Hub Forums","axa","764.80","2014-05-23T18:49:54","Axa's Guide to Secure Email Providers","General Discussion/Security","Here is a post from ProtonMail discussing their threat model and what ProtonMail can and cannot do for users:   ****************** In this article, we will describe both the threats ProtonMail is designed to guard against, and also the threats ProtonMail is NOT designed to counter.   From a high level, our premise is that a service like the now-defunct Lavabit does add value, despite some inherent weaknesses. We designed ProtonMail around many of the same principles, but with some significant improvements. At the very core, email as a secure communication medium is fundamentally flawed. The SMTP protocol was first introduced in the 1980â²s well before many of the threats of the modern internet were even envisioned, much less understood. However, despite its age and flaws, SMTP is not going away anytime soon, and email will continue to play a major role in our lives. For truly secure communications, one cannot really recommend email, but for most of us, there is no other option.  Our second philosophy is that security needs to be made easy enough to be usable. The most secure system is simply not useful if it is so complicated nobody is willing to use it. As ProtonMail developers, we will be the first to tell you that there are certainly more secure ways we could have built a service like ProtonMail. The reason we built ProtonMail the way we did is not because we werenât aware of these other methods, but because we would have had to sacrifice too much usability. There will always be a trade off between security and usability, anybody that tells you otherwise is lying. And just because a system is not 100% secure does not mean you should not use it, the key is understanding the limitations of your security. And for the record, there is no such a thing as a 100% secure system.  At ProtonMail, our goal is to guard against mass surveillance and we feel the best way to do that is to give encryption to everybody. The only way to do that, is to make encryption easy to use. This is why ProtonMail works out of any modern web browser, and why we went to great lengths to make the cryptography completely invisible to the user. However, this approach does come with certain shortcomings.   1. Compromised User â This is the most common type of compromise. Even if you use the worldâs most secure electronic communication system, advanced encryption does you no good if there is a keylogger on your computer recording all of your keystrokes. ProtonMail does not and can not guard against a compromise of a userâs machine.   2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks - This is a very rare attack where an adversary will sit between the user and the ProtonMail servers and tamper with the data being relayed between the user and the server. However, because ProtonMail messages are encrypted before they leave the userâs browser, an attacker cannot get message data by simply listening in on the communications. The attacker would have to actually send the userâs browser a modified version of the ProtonMail website which may secretly pass the mailbox password back to the attacker. This is a far more difficult attack that can typically only be executed by a strong adversary (like a government) and is generally a targeted attack. It cannot easily be used on a large scale to perform mass surveillance.  Fortunately, there are several ways to protect against a MITM attack. ProtonMail employs SSL to ensure our encryption codes are properly delivered to userâs browsers and not tampered with en-route. Generally speaking, a successful MITM attack requires breaking SSL, typically by using a forged SSL certificate. There are browser plugins in existence today which can be used to detect forged certificates and greatly reduce the risk of a MITM attack. We recommend Certificate Patrol or Perspectives (although the second one may need more time to mature).   3. Unauthorized backdoor â Another attack vector would be if an attacker somehow gained access to ProtonMailâs servers in Switzerland without us noticing. Such an attacker could conceivably change the ProtonMail software to send bad encryption code to userâs browsers that would somehow allow the attacker to get unencrypted data. ProtonMail has implemented numerous safeguards against this on the server level. We have routines that constantly scan for code changes and will detect them. The attacker would have to gain control of the server, instantly change the behavior of the code scanners, and then modify the software all without anybody at ProtonMail noticing. The odds of this being successfully executed is indeed quite low.  Our risk analysis indicates that ProtonMail offers good (but not perfect) protection for the vast majority of users. There are however some risks for users facing a strong adversary, such as a government focusing all its resources on a very specific target. In such a case, we donât think crypto would be of much benefit as this XKCD comic would apply.  Below are some examples of recommended, and not recommended use cases for ProtonMail:   NOT RECOMMENDED:  Edward Snowden â If you are Edward Snowden, or the next Edward Snowden, we would not recommend that you use ProtonMail. And in case Mr. Snowden was foolish enough to try, we have already blocked the username snowden@protonmail.ch   RECOMMENDED:  Client-Attorney Privilege â If you are an attorney working with a client and you fear a court might subpoena your private communications with your client, ProtonMail offers a great deal of protection. ProtonMail will not release ANY data unless provided with an enforceable Swiss court order. To get such an order, the case must first work its way through the Swiss courts where stricter privacy laws might result in a different finding. Even if an adversary went through the expensive and time consuming procedure of obtaining such an order, ProtonMailâs zero access cryptography means we would only be able to release encrypted data since we do NOT hold the encryption keys. Furthermore, under Swiss law, ProtonMail can never be compelled to build in any sort of backdoor access to obtain the encryption keys from the user.   Private Citizen with Privacy Concerns â ProtonMail is also perfect for an individual (or corporation) that does NOT want the government to have access to all of their emails at any time, and does not like Google or Microsoft constantly scanning and archiving all conversations. With ProtonMail, the barrier of entry for mass surveillance is high enough that mass surveillance simply is not practical. This is an example where âgood privacyâ can act as a meaningful substitute to âperfect privacyâ.  We would like to conclude with a few thoughts about privacy and surveillance in general. Some people make the assertion that if you are NOT a criminal, there is no need for privacy. To those critics, we simply ask, does that mean that only criminals have curtains over their windows?  On a more serious note, there are also critics who assert that by building ProtonMail, we are providing a powerful tool for criminals to evade the authorities. There is no denying that ProtonMail provides a high level of security and privacy for criminals, but one has to remember that the world does not consist of just criminals. These are also dissidents, and democracy activists living under authoritarian regimes where freedom of speech is not respected. Then, there are the rest of us, law abiding private citizens who simply want control over our online data. We can either chose to live in a world where everybody is under surveillance, or a world where everybody (criminals included) have privacy. We feel that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right, and we are willing to fight and work towards protecting that right.   ******************  ProtonMail is not a replacement for using PGP with an anonymous service like Lelantos Mail. For many it is the next best option because of convenience, and anyone using a mail service in the clear like Gmail or Yahoo can easily move to ProtonMail and enjoy the benefits of increased security and privacy.

It is all very time consuming. now I am not looking for sympathy as I know that I am not going to get it.There appears to be a lot of nice people on this forum. Some are obviously very helpful. I am actually a pensioner as my username suggests. I visited the dark web when I realised that I was not going to be able to pay my rent this month, I realise now that it was an act of desperation and then reality set in. There are millions of people in the same situation. Facts  the internet is a great place but it is also a place for all the worlds scammers to congregate. There is really very little difference between the clear net and the dark net as far as scammers go. I actually feel safer on the dark net. Only a fool would believe that anybody that knew how to make easy money was going to share there secret on the internet. I worked all my life and have nothing to show for it. I have helped many people , the result was that I went from being fairly wealthy to being broke but that was my choice and I have no regrets. I live in what the tourist brochures call a tropical paradise, not because I am wealthy but because it is cheaper to live here than in my home country. I considered asking if anyone wanted to rent my apartment for a month. In a moment of madness i considered selling my passport as I do not really need it, but frankly I would not know how. I have tried to get online loans but I do not have a good enough credit rating even though I would pay them back. I need to raise 500 pounds within a week or I will be in shit street. I am definitely not looking for charity. If anybody has any genuine advice I would appreciate it. I guess I can be contacted from this site as I gave my anonymous email address when I registered. Thanks for reading.   Love and peace from one ashamed pensioner ",""

"The Hub Forums","The Real SIGAINT","9585.0","2015-06-01T22:42:57","[article] Tor connections to hidden services could be easy to de-anonymize","General Discussion/Security","URL: http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/576210/tor-connections-hidden-services-could-easy-de-anonymize/  ","Tor connections to hidden services could be easy to de-anonymizeIt's safer to access Internet websites over Tor than hidden services, researchers saidLucian Constantin (IDG News Service) on 30 May, 2015 02:48Identifying users who access Tor hidden services -- websites that are only accessible inside the Tor anonymity network -- is easier than de-anonymizing users who use Tor to access regular Internet websites.Security researchers Filipo Valsorda and George Tankersley showed Friday at the Hack in the Box security conference in Amsterdam why Tor connections to hidden services are more vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks.One of Tor's primary goals is to provide anonymity for Internet users. This is achieved by routing their Web traffic through a series of randomly chosen nodes or relays before passing it back onto the public Internet.The nodes that make up the Tor network are run by volunteers and they can have specialized roles. There are nodes called entry guards that serve as the first hops onto the network and there are also exit relays that pass the traffic back onto the Internet.Internet servers that receive traffic from Tor users won't see the real IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of those users. What they'll see will be the IP addresses of randomly chosen Tor exit nodes.The Tor hidden service protocol extends the anonymity protection to servers as well. It makes it impossible for users to see the real IP address of a server that runs a Tor hidden service, like for example, a website.Hidden services use addresses that end in .onion, a pseudo top-level domain that doesn't exist on the Internet and only resolves inside the Tor network. This anonymity protection for both servers and users makes hidden services attractive to political activists in countries where free speech is not well protected or where Internet surveillance is common, but also to criminals who use such websites to hide their activities from law enforcement.The infamous online bazaar Silk Road where users sold drugs, arms and other kinds of illegal goods and services, operated as a Tor hidden service. The FBI eventually shut it down and arrested its owner, but other similar marketplaces have taken its place.The biggest threat to the Tor network, which exists by design, is its vulnerability to traffic confirmation or correlation attacks. This means that if an attacker gains control over many entry and exit relays, they can perform statistical traffic analysis to determine which users visited which websites.The Tor developers are closely monitoring exit relays and removing bad ones from the network, so it's relatively hard for someone to pull off such an attack. In addition, if an attacker wants to identify Tor users visiting a specific Internet website, they'd have to gain control over a very large number of exit and entry nodes in order to increase their chance of success, since the relays will be different for every connection.That's not the case with Tor hidden services and in fact attackers could quite easily and with 100 percent reliability take control of all the rendezvous points between Tor users and specific Tor hidden services, at least for a period of time.Tor hidden services rely on nodes with a special HSDir (hidden service directory) flag to advertise themselves on the Tor network so they can be discovered by users. Every hidden service will select six HSDir nodes to serve as its rendezvous points on a given day. This selection is done from a pool of around 4,000 nodes based on a predictable date-dependent formula.With this formula both a Tor client and a Tor hidden service should select the same 6 HSDirs on a particular day. However, the researchers found that they could use brute force techniques to generate the keys needed for their own nodes to take up those rendezvous positions for a specific day.The researchers managed to place their own nodes as the 6 HSDirs for facebookcorewwwi.onion, Facebook's official site on the Tor network, for the whole day on Thursday. They still held 4 of the 6 spots on Friday.Brute-forcing the key for each node took only 15 minutes on a MacBook Pro and running the Tor relays themselves cost US$62 on Amazon's EC2 service.New nodes receive the HSDir flag automatically after being up for around five days and attackers could set up nodes to become the HSDirs for a particular hidden service for the next five days with around US$200, the researchers estimated.This technique will give attackers control over one end of the connection, but in order to perform traffic correlation attacks the attacker would also need to have visibility into the entry point. This can be achieved by someone who can monitor users' traffic before it enters the Tor network.For example, a government monitoring its Internet users through ISPs could use this attack to perform traffic analysis and determine who visited a dissident site hosted on Tor. A law enforcement agency could do the same with the help of ISPs to identify who is visiting an illegal website that runs as a Tor hidden service.The goal of the two researchers was to prove that ""hidden service users face a greater risk of targeted de-anonymization than normal Tor users,"" because it's much easier to reliably control all HSDirs for a specific hidden service than to control all Tor exit relays that might be used to access a website.Runa Sandvik, a security researcher and former Tor developer who was at the conference, agreed that it's technically easier to pull off such an attack than to monitor Tor exit traffic, but pointed out that the Tor Project is aware of the issue and has been working on a fix for some time.There is a proposal for the next generation of hidden services that will address not only this problem, but also other potential issues, Sandvik said. In the meantime, the Tor developers have tools that can detect relays trying to attack users of Tor hidden services, she said.A change in Tor that will be implemented soon will make it harder for new nodes to become HSDirs by forcing them to obtain a stable flag first, Valsorda and Tankersley said. This will require nodes to be online for a longer period of time before they can become HSDirs so it will make the attack more expensive, but not technically harder to pull off, they said.While users can't do much to defend themselves against this, the operators of Tor hidden services do have one option. They could use the attack themselves so that their own nodes will become HSDirs for their own hidden services.This won't prevent others from trying to take over the rendezvous positions, because the attack is essentially a race condition. However, if this happens, it will be very easy to detect that an attack is going on, the researchers explained.They released the brute-force tool they created for the attack on Github, as well as a separate HSDir analysis tool that can potentially detect such attacks."

"The Hub Forums","paracelsus","4333.0","2014-07-16T12:57:26","Idea for laptop killswitch -- averting LE raid","General Discussion/Security","So I posted this on the SR forums but I think it might be appropriate to ask here as well:   I have this idea for a killswitch to avert LE. I became interested in this after reading of a bust of a SR moderator, whereupon he was unable to close the lid of this device in time. I presume that he had employed disk encryption or was using TAILS and was looking to switch the laptop off.  Right now it's just a thought experiment, but would love to hear your thoughts on whether it would work and whether I should actually bother developing a script:    Proposed method  There is an Android app called Wireless IMU. It can send the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data to a specified IP address as UDP packets over a user-specified port. The mobile phone is connected to the LAN and sends packets containing raw gyroscope and accelerometer data to your machine.  The phone is placed in a fixed position near the machine, and is required to remain unmoved if the killswitch is not to be triggered. Perhaps an old phone would be most appropriate. On the machine one runs a script that executes tcpdump over the specified port and the data sent from the phone is parsed appropriately. Defining gyroscrope/accelerator cut-off values, we trigger a halt command that is initiated if the phone is ever moved. Moreover, if the packets stream is interrupted, e.g. connection is killed, the machine is also powered off.    Rationale  Here, we assume that the machine has strong disk encryption such that if it can be powered off, accessing the disk is completely impossible. A bust by LE would be swift and one is unlikely to have time to switch off their machine or nuke it. One can expect, however, that any device in the vicinity of your machine including your phone would not be moved or picked up either during a bust or while confiscating it.  Even if LE were aware of the possibility that you carried such a device, I just don't buy that they could be sufficiently careful to avoid moving the device even the slightest.

One possibility would be to have an alert come up and give you say, 10 seconds to override the shutdown. The problem here, however, is that it would create a vulnerability to the killswitch -- any override option is also an override option LE could access.  The best alternative I have come up with is if there is no anomalous sensor data and it appears as though the connection has been lost, instead of an immediate shutdown, all applications are closed and data saved, and there is a slow but more secure shutdown.  Brief losses in connection could be smoothed out by altering the frequency with which you sampled the sensor data.   LOL. If there was an earthquake, then it simply shuts down your machine. I initially toyed with the idea of nuking your disk if the killswitch is activated, but you would need to take into account the possibility of false positives.   So, in the event of an earthquake: worse case scenario, you lose 30 seconds of your life and possibly the erotic poetry you had been writing at the time.     ","ands if there was an earthquake?"

Trigger wire the door so that it automatically shuts the power to your computer when broken. If earthquakes, there will be a power loss anyways.  Better still, set up a hot key to instantly turn off your computer. So if you're sitting there right with your hands on keyboard when LE came in raiding, you can always move the fingers to press the hotkey and kill it. You can even use the default windows shutdown key. Once the windows are shutting down it's only a few sec before the power is totally off. The soldiers ain't gonna know how to revert this within these few secs.  Or you can just set your computer to shutdown after something like 5 minutes of idleness. LE can't get the laptop to their forensics within that little time. To prevent accidental work loss, you can set it to hibernate (shutting off power but saving all session info on HDD).  fnu",""

Probably true but it can take a long time and everyone can make a mistake, or forget something.  If you trust TAILS or whonix it will make it easier for you than building your own solution from scratch. It can be less secure though as those are interesting points for an attacker to try to corrupt and we know (heartbleed for example) than open source doesn't mean secure: there aren't that many well trained eyes watching the code...  OPSEC is rather complicated... Always to your best and try to have a better OPSEC each day. Keep learning.   As we see with SR1 server's content being used to build cases against vendors - the shit you do on the darknet now can be used against you in the future. Consider it will.  Forget your ego: never keep the same username for too long. Take rest from the network from time to time. Be paranoid. Have fun. And remember: if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime!  Good luck!","My only advice would be to spend as long as it takes to do your own research by simply reading as many resources and forums as you can. Arrive at your own truths for your own needs.

Instead of reading that, here are some helpful tips about how to not compromise your anonymity:  1- Don't link any of your clearnet information( i.e. emails, passwords, names, user names, phone numbers etc.), don't link them to any of your DN profiles. Then the feds will link your emails, passwords, names, user names, phone numbers etc. to you.   2- Use PGP encryption. PGP encryption is amazing tool to prevent people from monitoring your private messages, your emails among other things, so USE IT. I am getting very tired of myself requesting people to make PGP keys for safe communication. First of all, sending me a message with no PGP might give away your location. Second of all, no one is going to reply to you if you don't have a PGP key. So,  learn how to use PGP.  3- When you are downloading files on Tor don't open them while on Tor. This might give away your location.   4- Don't share files or torrent over tor. This also fill give away your anonymity.   5- Don't log in to any of your clearnet accounts on the darknet. Especially a Bing(who really uses Bing), Yahoo, Google, YouTube, Gmail because they, among others, send their traffic to NSA and the NSA will link your clearnet accounts to your darknet accounts.   Remember these tips. I would suggest reading Jolly Rogers security thread but these are just some tips for new people. ",""

I decided it would be prudent to read this thread before taking any action and yesterday succeeded in downloading and installing tails (=> huge sense of achievement for non computer literate person). I saved tails on a USB and my PGP on another one as per JR's advice.  Today when I opened my computer (Windows 7), I had a box telling me that my device is ready to use IEEE 1667 Generic Silo & ACT. It appeared that this had been downloaded without any input from me. From my brief research it seems that it is a way of passwording USBs?  I haven't yet tried my USBs.

"The Hub Forums","El Presidente","7447.0","2015-04-10T15:14:33","Securely wiping an SSD","General Discussion/Security"," Can't hurt security wise but won't help disk longevity and we wouldn't rely on it.  The disk firmware prevents you from accessing user specified NAND addresses so you never really know where on the physical disk memory your data is being written to. In theory your overwriting may never actually hit the NAND cell holding your data.  Recovery of such data typically involves removing the controller board and accessing NAND directly (assuming knowledge of the firmware stored keys) so isn't exactly trivial but we wouldn't trust manufacturers not to provide a backdoor allowing those who know to use the firmware directly through undisclosed & publicly undocumented controller commands.  Hardware FDE (OPAL) and software encryption used together but independent of each other are the best bet (obviously with different pass-phrase).  Probably one of the most simple strategies is to literally fill up the disk with crap (actually fill it so that all sectors are allocated) - then all the wear balancing in the world isn't going to prevent all memory being overwritten.  Standard wipe tools don't do this, thet progressively move through the sectors overwriting one sector at a time which isn't very effective for SSDs.","Quote from: El Presidente on April 10, 2015, 01:39:49 pmQuote from: sldk on April 10, 2015, 12:18:23 pmQuote from: El Presidente on April 10, 2015, 12:13:50 pmSome good advice here, something to be aware of though, not all SSD FDE devices are created equal.

In general, if you're running Windows or Linux (non-Tails) the best version of PGP/GPG to use is GPG4USB.  It's probably the most intuitive.   You can download GPG4USB from: http://www.gpg4usb.org/  Zaphod ","hi, where is the best pgp introduction?thx!"
"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","5932.0","2014-11-30T19:54:04","Hi","Start Here/For Beginners"," In addition to ensuring that you have the 5 dashes, you also have to ensure that there aren't any spaces in front of the dashes. The key you provided me with had a leading space in front of the first dash. Furthermore, you had not removed all the leading indentation. Using a text editor, the first character of each line of the key data has to start in column 1.   I took the liberty of correcting that key for you, and PM'd it back to you.   BTW, strictly speaking, you don't 'decrypt' keys, they are imported instead. In other words, you need to use the Import Key button in GPG4USB, as opposed to the Decrypt button when importing a key. Even if you have a properly-formatted PGP key in the editor pane of GPG4USB, if you press the decrypt button, you will get an error message, reading: ""No Data"".

As long as they have a password on their key (i think basically all pgp clients enforce this), you would have to brute force the password to get to 'true' key. However, a brute force attack against a weak passphrase is entirely possible.   If the key has been in any keyserver, a revocation certificate should be issued and uploaded. If if it hasn't getting a revocation certificate generated ASAP would be a good idea. Then toss that key and create a new one.  This is why before sending a PGP encrypted message, you always check it either by listing the packets or attempting to decrypt it yourself to make sure that have sent the right things to the right individuals.

"The Hub Forums","2fruits","2103.0","2014-03-21T04:50:46","Encryped phone question?!?!?!?!","General Discussion/Security","Any phone PERIOD is a bad idea.  If you have a cell signal, you can be detected to within a 20x20 foot square - that's the way cellular protocols work. Each tower has to know when to ""pass"" you onto the next tower (called a ""cell"" - hence ""cellular"") as you pass out of its range. It knows this because it measures your signal strength very precisely.  If you have 3 or more towers within your cellphone's range (and you almost always do) your position can be triangulated very precisely just by looking at the relative signal strength from each of the towers. As I said this is fundamental to cellular phones... you cannot work around this.  So basically you are carrying a little tracking device on you all day, every day... which can and does neatly map out:  - who you are - where you are - where you've been - who you've been with  and then by tapping voice/text/IP content:  - what you said - what you did  or by using trojans to access smartphone content, any of:  - live audio from using the phone's mic - live video using the phone's camera - your contacts, pictures, numbers, emails, etc.  If you're stupid enough to THEN back up your shit to cloud storage like (say) iCloud then all this data (including 3 weeks of location data) is all packaged neatly and ready for them to sniff or just take from the cloud provider.  The best business is not to conduct any business via a phone PERIOD. Or have one anywhere near you when you're doing business. Remember that even when off, most cellphones are simply ""hibernating"" and still poll towers occasionally. You have  to physically remove the battery and most smartphones don't let you do this without some screwdriver work.  Alternately, a metal cocktail shaker is apparently amazing as a shield. Drop your phones in there. But then they still know where those phones were, so your location is still kinda obvious. ",""

Frankly, the agencies prefer the way that WikiLeaks did it -- the stories would be in the news cycle for a few days to weeks, after which people would simply move on, and forget about it.

The report found that the two services allowed smartphones to reconnect to public Wi-Fi hotspots automatically, which could leave users vulnerable to fake hotspots with the right name, able to redirect users to bogus websites to harvest usernames and passwords.  Ars Technicaâs IT editor Sean Gallagher writes that the services open both Android and iPhone to a serious security threat, saying, âThereâs a much bigger threat to your security than somebody randomly fishing for you to connect to them â the networks youâve already connected to and trusted, like AT&T and Xfinity.  The NPR report, part of their Project Eavesdrop podcast, describes how easily smartphones automatically reconnect to hotspots called âattwifiâ by default â ie users have to instruct the phones not to connect to such hotspots, or disable Wi-Fi altogether to be sure that they will not connect to a bogus hotspot.  Ars Technicaâs more detailed report describes how such âfake hotspotsâ can be created with apps and tools on devices as small as Android phones, and deployed to disrupt internet users connection to a real hotspot then pick up the connection afterwards.  âThese free Wi-Fi connections are popular, for good reason â they help reduce the amount of broadband cellular data you consume, and they often provide better network speeds than what you can manage over a 4G connection,â Gallagher writes.  âBut they also offer a really easy way for someone to surreptitiously tap into your Internet traffic and capture your account information for less-than-friendly purposes.â  Earlier this year, the head of Europeâs Europol Cyber Crime division warned that free hotspots were increasingly used to steal private information from consumers in Europe, as reported by We Live Security here. Troels Oerting said, âWe have seen an increase in the misuse of Wi-Fi in order to steal information, identity or passwords and money from the users who use public or insecure wi-fi connections.â  Up to 10% of workers admit to using public hotspots with work machines, according to a recent survey by phone insurer ProtectYourBubble.  ESET Distinguished Researcher Aryeh Goretsky writes that any free Wi-Fi service carries risks in a We Live Security how-to here, âJust because it is free does not necessarily mean you should take advantage of it. It is possible that someone might be monitoring and capturing network traffic going through the âfreeâ Wi-Fi connection, for reasons ranging from questionable to illegal, such as injecting targeted advertising into web pages to the outright malevolent, such as stealing credentials for email, financial institutions and so forth.â  âIf you must use the free Wi-Fi service, do not access log in to any sites for which you need a password, such as your email, bank or online shops. It is more secure to tether your tablet or laptop to your smartphone and make use of its data connection, or use a portable hotspot. While such connections may not be free, they do have the advantage of being far less likely to be intercepted.â",""

The Source  This Vice article [Clearnet: http://www.vice.com/read/confessions-of-a-drug-dealers-delivery-service-guy] provides the source of the information for this blog post. Using some basic background knowledge on how covert groups operate, it is simple to parse and analyze the drug delivery service tradecraft.   Recruitment   As with many covert groups, the recruitment process relied on personal connections. This  social network grounded approach to expanding a covert organisation is generally good for initial security. The recruits are unlikely to be agents sent to infiltrate the organistation as the long standing social ties between members and recruits both establishes trust and serves as  vetting.  Developing a covert organisation based on  social network ties provides a means of rapid expansion and easy security clearance. The downside is that once a single member of the organisation is compromised, the adversarial security forces can easily roll up the whole network. The poor compartmentation of a  social network based covert organisation is its Achilles heel. The security of the organisation is critically dependent on the security of each individual member.   ProTip: Expand your covert network with individuals who are passionate about your ideological beliefs. Ensure strong compartmentation, starting with recruitment.   Leverage   The principal of the organisation Ã¢â¬ÅNathanÃ¢â¬Â requires that the recruit provide a verifiable address and means of contact, along with dire warnings of consequences in the case of infractions. This is very basic control principles, typical of covert organisations.  The major security problem with this approach, of course, is that the records maintained by the networkÃ¢â¬â¢s principal are a high value target for the adversary. Compromise of the principalÃ¢â¬â¢s records will lead to total collapse of the network, and interdiction for every member involved. There is no chance of evasion.   ProTip: No logs, no crime. Do not keep records of the members of your covert organisation. These records are extremely sensitive.   Operational Actions   The illicit operation, the drug sale, is intended to be rapid and minimize the period of vulnerability for both parties. Interestingly, this is possibly a poor choice if the threat is surveillance. There are few reasons a random individual would enter a domicile for a short duration. Also of note, the covert organisation provides no reasonable cover story for why the agent (the drug courier) is entering the residence of the client. A simple Ã¢â¬Åwhat were you doing?Ã¢â¬Â type question would likely completely blow the whole operation.   ProTip: Minimising the period of vulnerability improves the chances of operational success. Always make sure your agents are capable of delivering plausible cover stories.  Cover for action   Cover for Status   The covert organisation has, surprisingly enough, chosen to enforce a uniform that makes their agents blend in with the mainstream. This is completely inline with the typical operational disguises employed by covert organistations operating in controlled territory the world over. (See: Moscow Rules  go with the flow; MurphyÃ¢â¬â¢s Laws of War:  don't stand out, it draws fire)   ProTip: They got this one exactly right.   All phones are bugged   Each operational use of the phone provides the adversary with minimal value. There is a unique identifier for the client (e.g. Ã¢â¬ÅLucyÃ¢â¬Â), and the agent acknowledges receipt of the directive (Ã¢â¬ÅOKÃ¢â¬Â). The dispatchers interaction with the client is itself run over multiple phone lines and kept to short, simple, normal statements.   ProTip: This is very much inline with all covert organisationsÃ¢â¬â¢ guidelines for using phones. Never use keywords, keep the content as vague as possible, minimize the period of vulnerability Ã¢â¬â get off the phone!   OPSEC FAIL: attracting attention   This is an instance of  preference divergence, a common problem for covert organisations. The financial resources provided to the agent of the principal are siphoned off and directed towards non-operational uses (the drug courier skims and pockets his cab stipend.) There doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t appear to be any consequence to this operational security failure, however it jeopardizes the entire organisation. If Ã¢â¬ÅNathanÃ¢â¬Â were a more disciplined principal he would monitor his agents more closely and ensure they are conforming to the organisational security requirements. Strangely, drug dealers are not strict disciplinarians.   ProTip: if the securit of the entire organisation is dependent on the security of each individual agent Ã¢â¬â enforce the operational security requirements strictly!   Aliases   The agent is using an alias to provide pseudonymity from malicious clients. This provides some minimal level of security. It is definitely better than not having any cover at all. However, as noted above, it should be combined with a robust cover story for why the agent is visiting a residential home for a brief period.   Discharging the agent  After a promotion, the drug courier decides to find a new line of work. If the organisation was stricter in their OPSEC practices, the departure of an agent wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t place anyone else in jeopardy. As it stands, it seems clear that the agent who is now drawing attention to himself by writing about his experience in a national magazine(!) still retains sufficiently sensitive information to unravel the network.   ProTip: compartment early, compartment often. It is safer than any alternative.   TL;DR  Compartment your covert organisation from recruitment through to operational action so that when your agents leave or are compromised they are unable to compromise the organisation. Ensure that your operational activities have good  cover for status (e.g. a disguise) and  cover for action (e.g. a strong cover story). Strong compartmentation, strong cover, and be aware of the risks of using social networks for building a covert organisation.  Posted by the grugq Oct 7th, 2013","a friend of mine solicited hardcore drugs for a Manhattan drug kingpin, who was looking for a new pot delivery guy. My friend encouraged me to try out for the job.;He asked me to provide documentation of my current address and phone number as an insurance policy. If I ran out on him, he warned me heÃ¢â¬â¢d hold my friends responsible for the deficit funds and/or drugs.;the transaction and exit should be as swift as possible. Ã¢â¬ÅYou arenÃ¢â¬â¢t here to hang out,Ã¢â¬Â she said. Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬â¢s not a social call, and they arenÃ¢â¬â¢t your friends.

He believed this uniform would attract little attention as I walked around with thousands of dollars worth of pot in a laptop case slung over my shoulder.;Although I used my flip-phone constantly at work, I was never given clientsÃ¢â¬â¢ addresses over the phone. Clients calls would go to a dispatcherÃ¢â¬âa third party who took the call, traced the number through a database of numbers, and then returned the call from a different phone to confirm their request for drugs. After their request was confirmed, I received a call from another phone. The dispatcher only told me, Ã¢â¬ÅYou got Nick,Ã¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬ÅYou got Lucy.Ã¢â¬Â I was banned from responding with anything besides a murmured Ã¢â¬ÅOK.Ã¢â¬Â;Each day I was given a stipend of $40 for cabs. No one knew if I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t spend the $40. Instead of taking cabs, I ran around in a frantic state that negated every other measure I took to not draw unwanted attention;I shook his hand and said, Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m Jack.Ã¢â¬Â He gave me a knowing grin. Ã¢â¬ÅSo thatÃ¢â¬â¢s the name youÃ¢â¬â¢re using?Ã¢â¬Â he asked."

Multi-sig is intended to make the release of escrow more fair, because you have 3 parties involved - the vendor, the buyer and (in this case) the market.  Two out of three of the parties have to agree to the release of the coin. Usually the buyer will agree to finalize and then the vendor will sign the transaction, which allows the coin out of escrow.   Theoretically the market admin can't withdraw the money unilaterally, as was done in the Evo exit scam (because no one was using Evo's multi-sig feature). I don't believe that BB's multisig is this foolproof, or properly implemented however. I'm skeptical.

It all depends on who is conducting the surveillance, and why. If you're considered a threat of some sort or other, you can be surveilled for years on end. Look at some of the people J. Edgar Hoover targeted.    A hardware or software keylogger are the only ways I can think of, offhand. You should be safe from a software keylogger as long as you don't go around downloading/running stuff off the net. For you to have a hardware keylogger, you would have to be the victim of a black-bag job. Black bag jobs are done by teams of specialists; this is a tactic normally used only against high-value targets (like Jake Appelbaum).   Another notable target was Nicodemo ""Little Nicky"" Scarfo. He was an early user of PGP, and the FBI couldn't read his messages. The FBI sent in a team to do a black bag job on Scarfo's office; they planted a keylogger, to grab Scarfo's PGP password.    I'll have to think about that one.    If you have been the victim of a black bag job, then your computer could have a keylogger installed; cameras/microphones could be installed in your walls to provide video/audio surveillance, including watching you type in your passphrase(s) as you enter them.   Let me reiterate... this is not for low-value targets. Surveillance of this type is EXPENSIVE in terms of both money and manpower, so it it is not used as a general rule, unless you are considered some sort of threat.    Very unlikely, unless they consider you some sort of threat.    Impossible to say -- it depends on who is surveilling you, and why. One thing that can be said for sure is that local PDs don't have a large budget for surveillance, so they are very prone to pick their targets carefully.   Zaphod ","1.

Is there a typical length or max time of surveillance they would put you under? What if they find nothing, how long then?  No answer for you here. I imagine as long as they need to.  2. What are ways to attack USB persistent volumes? I think mine is compromised.  What do you mean by this? Do you mean a USB drive you use as storage? Or are you booting from the USB drive?If you mean a USB drive you're plugging in and using as storage, it can be attacked a number of ways. The data can be stolen, it can be infected so that it spreads when plugged in elsewhere, etc. If you're using it as an OS, it can be hacked like any other OS. I seen in a previous post about LUKS encryption. The only way that is being attacked is by getting the key to de-crypt. If you are compromised though, that key could potentially be scraped from memory.  3. If they own your router, what is possible from that point?  Traffic sniffing, pivoting to the rest of your network, man-in-the-middle attacks. Basically, if they're on your LAN, you're done.  4. TAILs is verified. Why and HOW am I still compromised?  What do you mean by ""verified?"" There are still vulnerabilities out there whether they're publicly known or not(0-days). It can still be compromised like any other operating system. If you are using it as a live OS, then it will revert back to it's initial state each time it is booted, however, you mentioned persistent storage so I don't think this applies to you.  5. Likelihood of 24 hour surveillance for non-vendor?  Nothing to help you with here either. I'd imagine that it depends on your weight and the workload of the police force. My area would love to get ahold of anybody buying drugs off the dreaded darknet. It would eat up local media. 6. Feds pass off surveillance after nothing found to local PD? Likely? Does it have to be same agency?  I imagine they work together. Depending on how big of a fish you are to them, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't just have local PD do it as to not waste their time.  7. Where did all the real motherfuckers go?

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","6090.0","2014-12-16T23:36:20"," Surveillance help - Anyone worth shit that isn't in jail already?","General Discussion/Security"," There are anti-virus packages for Linux, e.g. Clam Antivirus, but these are aimed more at scanning files for people who will pass these files along to Windows systems. The reason that anti-virus packages are almost never used on Linux is that there are probably no more than a dozen or two viruses in the wild for Linux. Compare this with Windows, which has probably a few hundred thousand -- there is just no comparison.   The main thing that protects Linux and other Posix systems is the design philosophy. Basically, you can sum it up like this: ""In Windows, everything is permitted, unless specifically forbidden. In Unix/Linux, everything is forbidden, unless specifically permitted.""   Later versions of Windows have cleaned things up somewhat, but it used to be possible, in the early days, to add a .com or .exe to almost any file, and Windows would then attempt to run it.   As far as capturing a password goes, someone would need to get you to download and run an executable file like a keystroke logger. For obvious reasons, this is a LOT more difficult for Linux than it would be for Windows.  LUKS is believed to be secure... as long as you maintain physical control of the USB device, you should really have nothing to worry about.

Is there a typical length or max time of surveillance they would put you under? What if they find nothing, how long then? It's a function of the resources of your adversary and severity or significance the crime you are suspected of having committed. Note: if you're a small fish, they may not necessarily know that.   Finding nothing: well, how long they continue investigating is a function of how  certain they are that you have done what you're suspected of having done, how serious the crime is, and how likely it is that they will find something if they continue looking.     2. What are ways to attack USB persistent volumes? I think mine is compromised. Refer to #4.  Also, from where did you buy the USB flash drive? Read into TAO mail interception and the BadUSB and Rubber Ducky to get an idea of what is possible.   In what way do you think it's compromised?   3. If they own your router, what is possible from that point?  End-to-end traffic correlation. You don't need to decrypt data to know who is sending it and to whom. From there, they could infer your identity and what you're doing.  Read into the netflow attack that was recently reported. If they compromised your router, the correlation could even be more fine-grained than if your entry node were compromised.  https://blog.torproject.org/blog/traffic-correlation-using-netflows http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html    4. TAILs is verified. Why and HOW am I still compromised? How did you verify it? Did you verify the key fingerprint (the long version) of the public key?    Moreover, perhaps they didn't compromise TAILS, but rather, the system on which you boot it. Is there a possibility that they would had been able to access your computer in your absence and install a rootkit? Read into evil maid attacks: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/10/evil_maid_attac.html  Also, the system that you boot TAILS on --  did you remove the internal disk from the device? What if they modified the bootloader and made it  appear as though you were loading the TAILS USB, when in fact, it was booting a modified keylogging version of TAILS from your internal drive.  5. Likelihood of 24 hour surveillance for non-vendor?  It doesn't matter what you are or what you have done, it matters what they  think you have done are a continuing to do.   6. Feds pass off surveillance after nothing found to local PD? Likely? Does it have to be same agency?  No opnion.    7. Where did all the real motherfuckers go?

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","9770.0","2015-06-06T19:45:49","Veracrypt and luks","General Discussion/Security"," It depends on your degree of paranoia. The rationale behind using 3 cascaded ciphers was in case any one of the ciphers were broken; in that case, the data would be protected by the other two.  As far as AES goes, the best publicly-known attack against it has reduced its' strength by a whole two bits: AES128 has been reduced to 126 bits, and AES256 has been reduced to 254. If a break in AES were ever to be discovered, cryptographers around the planet would collectively soil their undies, so great would be the impact of such a discovery.   The authors of VeraCrypt, to the best of my recollection, appear mainly concerned with some of the key-derivation/key-stretching routines in the original TrueCrypt. I would hasten to point a few things:   1) TrueCrypt has now been audited, by some independent parties, and found to be essentially sound.   2) TrueCrypt has passed the torture test, being beaten-up by the 800lb gorilla and surviving -- the Brazilian police couldn't break TrueCrypt-encrypted files, and neither could the FBI, even after a full year of trying. (The fact that the FBI went to great lengths to grab Ross's laptop while it was still powered-on only underscores this fact.)   3) VeraCrypt has not been audited, nor does it have the same track record as TrueCrypt.   4) Regardless of which software you use, you must remember two things:   1)  Full-disk encryption (FDE) is a fall-back security measure -- it is meant to secure your data as a last ditch measure when all else has failed; and2) Your data is NOT secure unless your container(s) are closed and/or your computer is shut-down.  In particular, Ross failed to understand these points, which is to some extent, why he will spend his remaining years behind bars.

My take on why the TrueCrypt developers bailed is a simple one: they were  tired. They had been at it for 10 years of grueling, unpaid work. Given that they were anonymous, it's not even like they could include the TrueCrypt project on their resumes. They're getting older, just like the rest of us, they've got jobs and families to feed -- at some point, the drain on their time and resources became too much to bear. I suspect the straw that broke the camel's back was the secure boot feature in Windows 8.x. Remember, they had begun this project to secure Windows computers -- this was still their primary focus. I think they were simply not prepared to invest the amount of time and effort to re-jig TrueCrypt to deal with  the new boot mechanisms, not to mention a new disk partitioning scheme (i.e. GPT).

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:49:23","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Some people have an invincibility mind set that nothing will ever be able to be tied to them or derived from their online communications.     Well guess what? They do not have to use your online communications to find out who you are. All that needs to happen, is for you to do something stupid and become a person of interest and they will be monitoring your activities online to the best of their abilities. Remember you only need to screw up once.     For example, maybe you become a person of interest and the FBI gains a subpoena to your Facebook account where you stupidly bragged to a friend of yours about participating in certain online activities. This happened to one of the members of  LulzSec who transferred a data dump that he obtained through SQL injection exploits to a friend of his using his own Facebook in his own name. So do not ever talk about Silk Road or any of your online activities on any social media platform.     Even if a company does not currently keep logs, a court order may perhaps be used to force a company to start keeping logs.  Hush Mail was forced to hand over 12 CDs worth of e-mails from three Hushmail accounts, following a court order obtained through a mutual assistance treaty between the U.S. and Canada. According to the following article.  http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/     When it comes to being threatened by a court order from the federal government, 99.99% of all companies will comply to avoid either prosecution themselves, or shutting down their business as we saw previously with  Hide My Ass.      But one company decided to stand up to this type of bullying that you may have heard of called  LavaBit as seen in the following article.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/lavabit-ladar-levison-fbi-encryption-keys-snowden      You see what I am talking about? The federal government ordered this man to hand over all his encryption keys and SSL keys which compromised the privacy of 400,000 users just so they could gain more data on one man, Edward Snowden. And they used bullying tactics and attempted to bankrupt the owner of Lavabit by fining him $5,000 per day until he handed over the keys. Unfortunately Levison had no choice but to hand over the keys or lose everything.     An interview on Reddit with Levison revealed what he claimed that other secure email providers who threatened to shut down were forced to stay up.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/19/lavabit_analysis/      There you have it. Anyone who tries to stand up to the government, especially in the United States will be met with swift justice, court orders and outrageous fines unless they comply and on top of it, slapped with gag orders so they cannot tell anybody about what the government is doing. ","The email service used by whistleblower Edward Snowden refused FBI requests to ""defeat its own system,"" according to newly unsealed court documents.The founder of Lavabit, Ladar Levison, repeatedly pushed back against demands by the authorities to hand over the encryption keys to his system, frustrating federal investigators who were trying to track Snowden's communications, the documents show.Levison is now subject to a government gag order and has appealed against the search warrants and subpoenas demanding access to his service. He closed Lavabit in August saying he did not want to be ""complicit in crimes against the American people"".In July, the authorities obtained a search warrant demanding Lavabit hand over any encryption keys and SSL keys that protected the site. Levison was threatened with criminal contempt â which could have potentially put him in jail â if he did not comply. Such a move would have given the government access to all of Lavabit users' information.The court ordered Levison to be fined $5,000 a day beginning 6 August until he handed over electronic copies of the keys. Two days later Levison handed over the keys hours after he shuttered Lavabit.;Lavabit's founder has claimed other secure webmail providers who threatened to shut themselves down in the wake of the NSA spying revelations had received court orders forcing them to stay up."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:50:45","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," I just had a realization about something that is pretty important and I wanted to share it with you, regarding security.  Verifying your downloads     As a general rule of thumb, you should  always download files from the home pages of their respective developers.   TOR: https://www.torproject.org Tails: https://www.tails.boum.org Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/     The reason this is so important, is that there are people who host maliciously modified versions of these programs and will host legitimate looking sites to try and get you to download their version, which can install things like backdoors into your computers, keyloggers, and all types of nasty surprises. Sometimes developers will offer mirrors for their projects, which are simply just alternative links to download from in case the main server is too slow, or down. Sometimes these mirrors can become compromised without the knowledge of the developers.      Maybe you do not have TOR or Tails on your laptop and you are traveling out of the country and the hotel that you are staying at has TOR's homepage blocked. There are times when you may need to find an alternative mirror to download certain things. Then of course there is the infamous  man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker can inject malicious code into your network traffic and alter the file you are downloading. The TOR developers have even reported that attackers have the capability of tricking your browser into thinking you are visiting the TOR home page when in fact you are not.     So what do you do about it? You can verify that the file you downloaded is in fact legitimate. The best tool for this is  GnuPG. The TOR developers recommend you get it from the following page (Windows Users).  http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html     You can install this program on your USB drive or on your actual computer, you will hear your actual computer's operation system referred to as your Host OS. So download it, run it, install it and we will start showing you how to use GnuPG.     If you remain on the GnuPG download page you will see something under the big green box that is called  OpenPGP signature. Download that into the same folder as the GnuPG file, this is the file that the download was signed with. Basically someone's signature saying, I made this file. And you also need a PGP public key to verify the signature. So to sum it up so far, the signature is created from the PGP private key, and can be verified by the PGP public key. The signature file is used to verify the program itself. So let us grab the PGP public key for GnuPG as well.      If you look on the same download page, under the heading Installation, you will see a link where it says  verify the integrity of the file. It will lead to you the following page.  http://gpg4win.org/package-integrity.html     Note where it says the following statement.  The signatures have been created with the following OpenPGP certificate Intevation File Distribution Key (Key ID: EC70B1B8). This is the link to the page that hosts the PGP public key file that you need to download, go there. On the page we just navgiated to, go to the bottom right where it says  Intevation-Distribution-Key (public OpenPGP key for signing files) and download that file. This is the PGP public key file, save it to the same place as your signature file for ease of use.      Okay, now that we have both the signature file and the PGP public key, let us now verify our download. First thing you need to do is navigate to the PGP public key file, called  Intervation-Distribution-Key.asc, right click it and go to  More GpgEX Options and down to  Import Keys. This will import the PGP public key into your key ring, and now you can verify the file with the signature.     Right click your actual file you want to verify, in this case  gpg4win-2.2.1.exe and go to   More GpgEX Options and down to  Verify and it should automatically detect the signature file where it says Input File, but if it does not, navigate to the signature file and make sure the box below it where it says  Input file is a detached signature is checked. Look at the bottom and click Decrypt/Verify and you will likely get the following message.   Not enough information to check signature validity. Check details.     Believe it or not, this is completely fine. Click on show details, you are looking for a specific result.   Signed on 2013-10-07 08:31 by distribution-key@intervation.de (Key ID: 0xEC70B1B8). The validity of the signature cannot be verified.     If you navigate back to the page from Gpg4Win that says  Check Integrity where you found the link to the page that contained the PGP public key you will see on that page.   Intevation File Distribution Key (Key ID: EC70B1B8)     Note the key ID from your decrypt result and the key ID from the Check Integrity page and note the email address ending in the same URL that we downloaded the PGP public key from. We have a match! I will explain the reason for this warning message later.     Now that we verified that our verification program is legit. Let us try and verify our Tails ISO file, since if we have a compromised Tails OS, then nothing we do will be anonymous. Let us get right to the Tails download page.  https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html     Scroll down to where it says Tails 0.22 signature and download that to your Tails folder where you have the ISO file that we already downloaded. Next scroll down to where it says Tails signing key, this is our PGP public key. Exact same procedure, import the key, then click Verify and specify the signature file if it has not already been specified for you, exact same settings and you will get the same warning message. As explained by Tails      In other words, you need to basically promise that the PGP public key you downloaded is safe by signing the PGP public key with your own private key, but we do not really need to do that and I will not be including a tutorial on how to do that. Tails explains that if you are worried about a compromised PGP public key, just download the key from multiple sources and compare them, if they all match, it is a good chance you are using a legit PGP key. Now let us finally move on to TOR because this one will be a little less straight forward, but once you do this one, you should be able to figure out how to verify anything. Navigate to their download page and find the package that you want.  https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en     To keep things simple let us choose Tor Browser Bundle 3.5, and under the orange box you will see a link  (sig). This is the link for the signature file, I hope by now you know what to do with it. Next we need the PGP public key right? Well it turns out that with so many developers working on TOR, there are multiple PGP public keys, and certain bundles were signed with different keys than other bundles. So we need to find the PGP public key that belongs to our Tor Browser Bundle. Check out this page.  https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en     It has a list of all the signing keys that they use and you can certainly use these key IDs to get what we want by simply right clicking on the signature file and click verify. You will get a warning.    Not enough information to check signature validity. Show Details     And in details it will say the following warning.   Signed on 2013-12-19 08:34 with unknown certificate 0x416F061063FEE659     Keep this entire number in mind for later, it is called a fingerprint. But for now if you just compare the last 8 digits to Erinn Clark's key ID ( 0x63FEE659) provided on the above page, and since she is the person who signs the Tor Browser Bundles you will see they match. But we want to be a bit more thorough, never settle for mediocrity.      Go to your task bar in Windows, and find the program called  Kleopatra, it looks like a red circle with a small white square in it. Right click it and go to  Open Certificate Manager. We are going to import the full keys using this manager. Also note, if you go to the tab that says  Other Ceriticates you will find the Tails and Intevation (GnuPG) keys we used earlier stored for the future when you need to download a new version of those programs and verify them again.  We are going to be following the instructions from the  verifying signatures page on the TOR Project website. Feel free to follow along from that page so you know what I am talking about and where I am getting my URL and numbers from.  https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en     In order to import keys, we need to first add an online directory where they are stored. So let us first add the online directory where the PGP public keys are stored according to the TOR website. Click  Settings then Configure Kleopatra. Next, click New and we are going to enter the following URL which I took right from the page above.  pool.sks-keyservers.net, and leave everything else as default and click OK.     Finally, click the button that says  Lookup Certificates On Server and we will be searching for Errin Clark's PGP public key by searching for her  fingerprint provided on the TOR website page called  Verifying Signatures above, remember, she is the developer who signs the Tor Browser Bundle. The fingerprint we are entering is  0x416F061063FEE659, does this number look familiar? It should, it is the number we got back the first time we tried verifying but without the actual PGP public key. if you get any warnings that pop up when searching just click OK and it should bring up Errin Clark's key, select it and click  Import. You should now have her key listed under  Imported Certificates.     Now let us go back and verify that signature one more time and see what happens. You should get something like the following.   Not enough information to check signature validity.Signed on 201-12-17 12:41 by errin@torproject.org (Key ID: 0x63FEE659).The validity of the signature cannot be verified.     TOR also explains this warning message in their words in case you are still not happy with the warning message.      I do not know about you, but I am happy with the result here, and I am certainly not going to track down Erinn Clark to get her key fingerprint, and it looks like our TOR Browser Bundle is legitimate as well! Now you know what to do when the PGP public key file is not directly hosted on the site itself, you have no more excuses to not verify your downloads.","If you see the following warning:Not enough information to check the signature validity.Signed on ... by tails@boum.org (Key ID: 0xBE2CD9C1The validity of the signature cannot be verified.Then the ISO image is still correct, and valid according to the Tails signing key that you downloaded. This warning is related to the trust that you put in the Tails signing key. See, Trusting Tails signing key. To remove this warning you would have to personally sign the Tails signing key with your own key.;Notice that there is a warning because you haven't assigned a trust index to this person. This means that GnuPG verified that the key made that signature, but it's up to you to decide if that key really belongs to the developer. The best method is to meet the developer in person and exchange key fingerprints. "
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:52:46","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Guys, I am not going to post exactly who started this thread quoted below, but it belongs to somebody who is a senior member with 375 posts. And he posted some very personal details and probably did not realize how very revealing these details are.      So why is this revealing? Why is this bad you might be asking. Well, Netflix collects metadata on its users just like every other big data corporation. If you are a Netflix user, you likely have a profile which keeps track of every movie you have ever watched and what you rated it and so forth.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/12/17/obama-bidenapple-amazon-twitter-netflix-yahoo-facebook-microsoft-google/4049305/      This user stated, that he just watched a specific movie, that he named. And also stated that this movie has been up since 2010. So how many people do you think watched this exact movie in the time frame that this guy stated he watched it? Probably not too many. Under 100 for sure since the movie has been up for almost 3 years. Well, now the federal government has a list of 100 or less suspects, one of which is this particular user on Silk Road.     But maybe he was using a VPN to connect to Netflix? Great.... does he use that VPN for anything else? Logging into his email, surfing the web, etc... Even if he used a VPN, maybe they keep logs? Maybe they are US based and are easily subject to subpoenas, maybe they will spill everything just like HideMyAss did. We just do not know, but this is exactly the type of information you all should NOT be revealing about yourselves. This is extremely bad OpSec people. Smarten up!     But then I looked even further through this user's profile and looked at his posts. I know which country he lives in, I know which drugs he has imported into his country and I know which countries he has imported those drugs from. This guy has spoken about cooking drugs, he talks about being in a cold part of his country, which not all parts of that particular country ever even get cold which helps law enforcement narrow down that list of suspects they got from Netflix.      If you think that law enforcement is not interested in buyers you are sadly mistaken. Sometimes if they establish that a buyer has been purchasing from a vendor that they are after, then busting the buyer can help them get to the vendor. They may take over the user's online identity and start ordering things from vendors since he already has established a trust with these particular vendors. If the vendor slips up because of the trust built up with the buyer, the vendor is in trouble.      I want you all to learn a lesson from this! If you are going to talk about which vendors you buy off of, which country you live in and which countries you have imported drugs from, then you better make DAMN SURE you do not start giving away details like which movie you watched last night on Netflix. That is almost as bad as logging onto a server with your real IP address. Keep your mouths shut about your personal lives!","Track Me If You Can...Awesome bit I just watched on Netflix. This is not terribly new, done in 2010, but he is quite thorough in his demonstrating how to disappear in modern US culture. I do have to add that some of the tech he introduced from the other side is quite alarming. The alphabet cops have waaay too much discretionary income. Time to start defunding them.;Electronic surveillance and the new health care law are on the agenda as Obama and Vice President Biden meet with a group that includes executives from Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:54:52","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," This post was inspired by a user who posted the following on the Silk Road forums.      We have talked about a large amount of ways to maintain your security, but we have not really talked about how to actually exchange currency. First thing I want to say as a disclaimer, is that I am not advocating that you do anything illegal. This is for educational purposes only and my recommendations are made assuming you are exchanging currencies anonymously as a means to protect your own privacy.     So you have found something online that you want to buy, and they are asking for Bitcoins as payment. How do you get the Bitcoins, and how do you get the Bitcoins to them? We are going to explore these options to a degree and hopefully by then you can make an educated decision on which method is best for your situation.     The options of buying Bitcoins are as follows.  1.  Sign up at an exchange online. Some popular exchanges are MT Gox, BTC-E, BitStamp and Coinbase The downside of purchasing Bitcoins at these exchanges, are that you need to verify your identity with them by means of submitting documents such as a driver's license or passport and a utility bill. If you are able to get past this first obstacle, then you need to find a way to get money into the account. Exchanges generally only accept wire transfers as a way to fund your account, but some of them offer a way of transferring money directly from your bank account. You can obviously see that by doing this you are exposing your true identity to the exchanges in one way or another, if not at the very least your location.  2.  LocalBitcoins.com LocalBitcoins offers a way for you to find a person in your local area, or if you want to go to another state or province to meet up with someone further away from you, you can choose where to look for people in that area selling Bitcoins either online (bank transfer or cash deposit) or meet them for cash in person. Traders have reputation lists, similar to a feedback score on eBay and you can find a trader who has a good reputation to buy off of. You send in a trade request and once the seller has received the money, he can release the Bitcoins from LocalBitcoins and they are sent to your wallet. Some people have expressed concern that law enforcement may act as buyers and sellers on LocalBitCoins, but it does not matter if this is the case in my opinion as long as you are not looking to buy large amounts. You can also, if you want, communicate with the buyer over email, arrive from public transportation, wear a hat, and all sorts of secret agent type tricks to try and conceal your identity. Wear a wig if you are super paranoid.  3.  Use a Bitcoin ATM Currently there is only one ATM in the world that I am aware of, and it is located in Canada. If you do not live in Canada then this does not help you. Luckily according to the an article, the company who is rolling out these ATMs called Robocoin is launching ATMs in other countries as well coming soon.  http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/02/robocoin-the-bitcoin-atm-is-heading-to-hong-kong-and-taiwan/     There will likely be some way to try and cut down on money laundering by getting you to verify your identification, but from what I understand, they currently only do this if you are selling Bitcoins for cash using the ATM, and not buying them for cash. The way that it works, is you choose the amount of BTC you want to buy, and you feed your cash into the ATM machine. You can at that point either print out a generated paper wallet, or choose a wallet of your own to send the Bitcoins to. This method may be another good way because it takes dealing with another human out of the transaction. Something you may need to be aware of is surveillance cameras, so maybe wear a hood, hat, wig, sunglasses, and so forth to disguise yourself if you are worried about your identity.   4.  Craigslist Believe it or not, there are a decent amount of people on Craigslist that you can meet up with in person and buy Bitcoins off of with cash. Your local area may not have a large number of listings, but you can always search in other nearby metropolitan areas and make a day trip out of it if you want. The same considerations about protecting your identity apply here as above.   5.  Mine your own Bitcoins I am not going to get into how to mine Bitcoins, or whether or not you should, but if you want to get Bitcoins without dealing with other people, this is one of the ways you can do it. Run your miners over Tor, stay anonymous and you will have yourself some untainted Bitcoins.     Okay, so now you have yourself some Bitcoins, how can you get them to somebody else that you want to buy something off of or trade with? As you probably know by now, every single transaction is tracked on  BlockChain.info. My wallet address that I have set up for donations for the hours I have spent working on this thread is 1PkJ928QWC5BuQAsHoNQzRV5wfnveJSRCp. You can check out the transactions related to it by going to the following address.   http://blockchain.info/address/1PkJ928QWC5BuQAsHoNQzRV5wfnveJSRCp     So you have Bitcoins sitting in your wallet, and if you send them to somebody else, it will show up on BlockcChain exactly where you sent them. A couple of things to keep in mind.   1. You purchased your Bitcoins from somebody or something. They may have kept a record of the wallet those coins were sent to. 2. If you dealt with a law enforcement or somebody trying to track you, then they can track where the coins are sent after you forward them to somebody else.      Right now the best method of trying to lose this trail is using something called a mixer or a tumbler. You can think of this like throwing your Bitcoins into a giant pile of coins with other users and then withdrawing them at a later time from the mixer. If you threw in 1 Bitcoin and pulled out 1 Bitcoin, think of all the other people who did the exact same thing. Possibly thousands of others withdrawing 1 Bitcoin from the exact same pile of coins. It has now become much harder for you to be linked to those coins. Then on top of that, maybe you do not withdraw 1 Bitcoin, maybe you only withdraw 0.5 Bitcoin right now and leave the other 0.5 Bitcoin in the pile. It becomes even harder to link those Bitcoins to you.      One website that does this is called BitcoinFog and can be found on a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL.   http://www.bitcoinfog.com/  http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/     BitcoinFog has been around for a while now and most people seem happy with the service they provide, so I would come to think that they are a trustworthy service. The way they work is as I mentioned above, and on top of that the service takes 1%-3% (randomized for obscurity) fee on each deposit. So you may put in 1.0 Bitcoins and take out 0.97 Bitcoin after fees and it mixes things up. You can also decide when you might want to withdraw it, whether it is in a month, week, days, and so forth. This is a good service to use and definitely mixes things up for you. The only thing you need to keep in mind, is that there is a trail of you sending your coins into BitcoinFog, which some people may or may not find suspicious. But what you do with your coins after BitcoinFog is going to be extremely difficult to track, if not impossible due to the vast number of transactions that are occuring in and out of BitcoinFog.      When you withdraw your coins from BitcoinFog, please make sure you send them to a  new wallet, and not the same wallet that you used to deposit them into BitcoinFog. Another option you can have when withdrawing the coins from BitcoinFog, is to get BitcoinFog to withdraw the coins directly to the person you want to buy something from. This takes the step of creating a new wallet and then having to forward it on and will keep things again extremely hard to track. Just keep their transaction fees in mind to make sure your desired seller is going to receive the correct amount of Bitcoins needed for the purchase or exchange.     Two other options you can use are provided by Blockchain.info and can be accessed by creating a wallet and logging in to it.  Send Shared and  Shared Coin. Send Shared is another way of mixing up coins, the way that it works is,  you send your money into the giant pot and it gets matched up with somebody else who is sending the same amount. An example of this is let us say we have 4 people. A, B and X, Y. Person A is sending 1 Bitcoin to person B and person X is sending 1 Bitcoin to person Y. Send Shared will match these amounts together, and it will mix them so that person A sends their 1 Bitcoin to person Y and person X sends their Bitcoin to person B. This way you are breaking the chain that links person A to person B because there is no record of person A ever sending anything to person B. This is a very good option to use, and one that many people prefer. Of course, there are many people using Send Shared, so the likelihood of there just being 4 people mixing up transaction is going to be more like 10,000 or more, making it pretty much impossible to track.      Shared coin uses a different method called coinjoin. Shared coin hosts a coinjoin server which acts as a meeting point for multiple people to join together in a single transaction. Having multiple people in a transaction improves privacy by making transactions more difficult to analyse. The important distinction between traditional mixing services is the server cannot confiscate or steal your coins. A sharedcoin transaction will look something like the following.     https://blockchain.info/tx/e4abb15310348edc606e597effc81697bfce4b6de7598347f17c2befd4febf3b     As you can see multiple inputs and outputs make the determining the actual sender and receiver more difficult. Basically it sends the coins in and out of many different wallets that are participating in Shared coin at the time and it does this to throw hundreds or thousands of transactions in all the wallets participating making it extremely difficult to track. The downside though is that coinjoin can never completely sever the link between the input and destination address, there will always be a connection between them, it is just more difficult to analyse. The benefit to Shared Coin is that while this processing is happening, you can hit cancel and get your coins back. When you send your coins into a traditional mixing service, an untrustworthy mixing service could potentially steal your coins.     Now that you have the knowledge to make an educated decision on how to mix up your coins en route to your intended destination, I feel that you can now put your mind at ease when looking to buy something with Bitcoins. It should be noted that you can reverse the process if you want to cash out your Bitcoins as well.","BEST WAY TO OBTAIN BTC'S?

Whether it is harm your privacy, steal your information or throw you in jail.     It should come to no surprise to us that the US government is actually the largest purchaser of malware.      After reviewing the sources in the article and other articles, some of these defense contractors expressed concern that the government was essentially funding criminal activity. They are paying independent hackers, in some cases blackhats to find zero day exploits (ones that have not been publicly announced yet) and buy these exploits off of them for huge sums up money, upwards of $100,000.     If you are using a laptop with a built-in microphone and camera, you are extremely vulnerable to an attack as John McAffee, the man who started McAffee Anti Virus explains.      So the first thing you should do right now is go grab some opaque tape and put it over your camera. If you are on a desktop and you have a webcam plugged in, unplug it unless you are using it. There is no reason to give an attacker an open window into your home. Next is your microphone, again desktops usually do not have built in microphones, but most laptops do. A microphone can be activated to listen to you talking and you need to find a way to physically disable it. The best way of course is to physically remove it, but I am not writing a tutorial on how to do that.     The FBI developed a keystroke logging software called Magic Lantern. Magic Lantern can reportedly be installed remotely, via an e-mail attachment or by exploiting common operating system vulnerabilities, unlike previous keystroke logger programs used by the FBI. It has been variously described as a virus and a Trojan horse. It is not known how the program might store or communicate the recorded keystrokes.      Then of course we have cell phones which can be activated remotely as well.      According to a few of the sources in the Wikipedia article, the cell phone can be activated to listen to you even when it is off. Pulling the battery will likely do the job, but there is no guarantee. So make sure the phone is not in the same room as you if you are talking about anything sensitive. As always, be super paranoid. Turn on the shower and put the phone in the bathroom if you have to, or better yet if you are going somewhere and you do not need your cell phone, leave it at home. Since most people never leave home without their cell phones, if somebody is snooping on you, they might think you are still at home. The first group of people that went to visit Snowden in Russia were told not to bring any laptops or cell phones with them for those reasons.      So we know the government is actively trying to gain remote access to your computer, they can listen to your phones, what should you do about it ?      You need to do the best you can to make sure the computers that you use are not exposed to the elements of risk. Always disable Javascript when visiting any websites unless the website is 100% trusted. Start phasing out the use of Microsoft Windows and MAC OSX because these closed source proprietary operating systems are not open to scrutiny and auditing the way open source Linux distributions are. There are more Windows users and thus more exploits available for Windows.      Running your operating system in a Virtual Machine, even if your host OS is Linux (remember Virtual Box can run on Linux) will help cut down on the retention of any malware you might pick up when on the internet. Do not go to any potentially harmful sites on your freedom fighting computers. Do not open any emails from anyone that you do not trust 100%. Regularly format your hard drives to keep them clean of any hidden viruses.      If you are unsure if something is safe, test it on a computer only meant for testing and one that is not connected to the internet. If you can reset your boot sector on your hard drive from time to time that would be a good idea as well, because you can get master boot sector viruses that would boot up a virus before your computer even boots into the OS.      Flash your BIOS, the BIOS is the first thing that runs when you turn on your computer, if you have a virus in your BIOS, there is no antivirus that can remove it, you would need to flash your BIOS and install a new firmware. Make sure the firmware is 100% trustworthy as infected firmware is the most common way to get a BIOS virus.      In the interest of saving space I will not go into detail on how to do all of these virus removals because there are numerous tutorials online and I am certainly not an expert in this field. I am sure there are many other things I have not covered in this post and if somebody else wants to chime in, please feel free to do so as long as you can provide sources for the claims you are making. I do not want to turn this thread into a bunch of unsubstantiated claims and paranoid conspiracy theories. But if you have something valuable to add to this, I am open to your input. ","According to a new report, the United States government is now in fact the single largest buyer of malware in the world thanks to the shift to âoffensiveâ cybersecurity and is leaving us all vulnerable in the process.In order for the government to exploit vulnerabilities discovered in major software, they cannot disclose those vulnerabilities to the manufacturers or the public, lest the exploit be fixed.âMy job was to have 25 zero-days on a USB stick, ready to go,â one former executive at a defense contractor told Reuters.

Cookies     Cookies are pieces of information that a web site can send to your browser. If your browser ""accepts"" them, they will be sent back to the site every time the browser accepts a page, image or script from the site. A cookie set by the page/site you're visiting is a ""second party"" cookie. A cookie set by another site that's just providing an image or script (an advertiser, for instance), is called a ""third party"" cookie.     Cookies are the most common mechanisms used to record the fact that a particular visitor has logged in to an account on a site, and to track the state of a multi-step transaction such as a reservation or shopping cart purchase. As a result, it is not possible to block all cookies without losing the ability to log into many sites and perform transactions with others.     Unfortunately, cookies are also used for other purposes that are less clearly in users' interests, such as recording their usage of a site over a long period of time, or even tracking and correlating their visits to many separate sites (via cookies associated with advertisements, for instance).     With recent browsers, the cookie setting that offers users the most pragmatic tradeoff between cookie-dependent functionality and privacy is to only allow cookies to persist until the user quits the browser (also known as only allowing ""session cookies""). Tails does this automatically by the way with Iceweasel.   Recent Cookie-Like ""Features"" in Web Browsers     In addition to the regular cookies that web browsers send and receive, and which users have begun to be aware of and manage for privacy, companies have continued to implement new ""features"" which behave like cookies but which are not managed in the same way. Adobe has created ""Local Stored Objects"" (also known as ""Flash Cookies"") as a part of its Flash plug-ins; Mozilla has incorporated a feature called ""DOM storage"" in recent versions of Firefox. Web sites could use either or both of these in addition to cookies to track visitors. It is recommended that users take steps to prevent this.     Managing Mozilla/Firefox DOM Storage Privacy. If you use a Mozilla browser, you can disable DOM Storage pseudo-cookies by typing about:config into the URL bar. That will bring up an extensive list of internal browser configuration options. Type ""storage"" into the filter box, and press return. You should see an option called dom.storage.enabled. Change it to ""false"" by right-clicking and choosing Toggle.   Managing Adobe Flash Privacy.     Adobe lists advice on how to disable Flash cookies on their website.  http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. There are some problems with the options Adobe offers (for instance, there is no ""session only"" option), so it is probably best to globally set Local Stored Object space to 0 and only change that for sites which you are willing to have tracking you. On the Linux version of Adobe's Flash plugin there does not seem to be a way set the limit to 0 for all sites and therefore its use should be limited or avoided. Luckily Tails does not have flash installed, but in case you are not using Tails be aware of this.     If you absolutely need to watch a video online, find a way to download the video to your computer and watch it that way. This takes the browser out of the loop of processing a video for you and eliminates those Flash cookies which help identify you.   Javascript     Javascript is probably the grand daddy of all vulnerabilities in internet browsing. The majority of exploits, malware, viruses and other computer take overs happen because of Javascript code executing in your browser. Javascript has many uses. Sometimes it is simply used to make webpages look flashier by having them respond as the mouse moves around or change themselves continually. In other cases, javascript adds significantly to a page's functionality, allowing it to respond to user interactions without the need to click on a ""submit"" button and wait for the web server to send back a new page in response.     Unfortunately, javascript also contributes to many security and privacy problems with the web. If a malicious party can find a way to have their javascript included in a page, they can use it for all kinds of evil: making links change as the user clicks them; sending usernames and passwords to the wrong places; reporting lots of information about the users browser back to a site. Javascript is frequently a part of schemes to track people across the web, or worse, to install malware on people's computers. It is best to disable Javascript ( about:config in URL bar search for Javascript and Toggle it to disabled) unless you absolutely trust the site or use the browser add-on NoScripts that comes with Tails and is available in Firefox to at least selectively block malicious scripts. Disabling Javascript outright is the best option though, and gumby has added a suggestion that can make it even easier to do this.      Javascript can also reveal an alarming amount of information about you even if you are using TOR or a VPN, including your browser plug-ins,  your time zone, what fonts you have installed (flash does this as well) and of course most browsers will send your user agent, meaning they tell the website what browser you are using and in some cases your operating system! Some of these details may not seem very important, but collected as a whole, it can make it easier to identify who you are online by almost generating a finger print of you with your specific settings related to your browser. Then as you hop around from site to site with your finger print, correlations and patterns can be drawn from this and eventually linked to you if you are not extremely careful.     Luckily, Tails and Whonix overrides the majority of this identifying information, so as long as you use Tails with Javascript disabled, or at the very least with NoScripts (Flash is disabled automatically) then you can cut down on the amount of information you share. Needless to say, it is not always possible to browse with Tails, so these are things you need to be aware of when you are browsing with regular browsers on your native OS with your browser of choice.      See what your browser is revealing about you at this page below. Do not visit it from your real IP address, since this page will be linked to the Silk Road forums from the moment I make this post part of my thread. As a result, you may wish to search online for other sites that check what information your browser is revealing about you. If you are confident in your OpSec abilities, use the one below.  http://browserspy.dk/","Supposedly NoScript doesn't block all Javascript even when it is enabled and no sites are on the whitelist. Not sure about that claim but I've seen people make it. There's a Firefox add-on (which also works in Tor Browser) called toggle_js which lets you toggle the about:config javascript.enable parameter through a toolbar icon so you don't have to go into about:config. I find it quite useful."

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-17T09:29:18","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Did you know that even if your system is whole disk encrypted, your data can still be extracted using something called a cold boot attack? Read on.     The first thing we need to talk about is RAM. RAM stands for random access memory. All you need to know about RAM is that RAM is the place in a computer where the operating system, application programs, and data in current use are kept so that they can be quickly reached by the computer's processor. RAM is much faster to read from and write to than the other kinds of storage in a computer, the hard disk, floppy disk, and CD-ROM. However, the data in RAM stays there only as long as your computer is running. When you turn the computer off, RAM loses its data.     When you turn your computer on again, your operating system and other files are once again loaded into RAM, usually from your hard disk. RAM can be compared to a person's short-term memory and the hard disk to the long-term memory. The short-term memory focuses on work at hand, but can only keep so many facts in view at one time. If short-term memory fills up, your brain sometimes is able to refresh it from facts stored in long-term memory. A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the processor needs to continually go to the hard disk to overlay old data in RAM with new, slowing down the computer's operation. Unlike the hard disk which can become completely full of data, RAM never runs out of memory.     Data can be extracted from the RAM using various tools. When you have a text document open and you are working on it, you are working from the RAM. Meaning that if you are working on a sensitive document, that document is temporarily stored in the RAM and is vulnerable to being extracted while the computer is on. When RAM is being stored, it is being stored  without any form of encryption, making it very easy to steal and a huge security risk.     Shutting down a computer through its normal shutdown cycle usually goes through a process of clearing the RAM. However, if the computer loses power abruptly like in a power outage, the computer does not go through its normal shut down cycle and some information remains on the RAM chips for a few seconds up to a few minutes. This is one of the ways cold boot attacks can work.     I also want to quickly introduce a type of RAM to you which will help you understand the rest of this article better. Below is a research paper and they used a type of ram called DRAM. DRAM stands for  dynamic random access memory. DRAM is the most common kind of random access memory (RAM) for personal computers and workstations. DRAM is dynamic in that, unlike static RAM (SRAM), it needs to have its storage cells refreshed or given a new electronic charge every few milliseconds. DRAM is designed to lose its memory quickly after losing power. Then there are subsections of DRAM called DDR. This is a way of making the memory more quickly available, but it is not really important to fully understand. Wikipedia can give you all you need to know about DDR. In this article we are focusing on just the concept of DDR, DDR2 and DDR3.      These are newer versions of DRAM that keep getting better, and I believe we are currently up to DDR4. But most computers circulating around today have DDR2 and DDR3 in them unless they are older computers, this includes laptops. DRAM is known as a type of volatile memory, it is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information. It retains its contents while powered, but when power is interrupted, stored data is quickly lost. But how quickly is it lost?     In 2008, a group of researchers wanted to see the practicality of extracting unencrypted data from the RAM in your computer. They argued that DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard. And by using an analysis tool they were able to search for key files (such as PGP keys) held in the RAM that could be used to decrypt encrypted volumes (drives) on your computer. They successfully were able to decrypt volumes using BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt. Below is the abstract of their research.   Here is an FLV video you can download to watch exactly how they did it.  https://anonfiles.com/file/97b5737dba6b96871fd862b8a587b8f0      This was very troubling to most people, and had many people freaking out when the research paper was released back in 2008 because even tough encryption tools like TrueCrypt could be rendered useless with an attack like this. Upon further analysis of the paper, I wanted to note that they used SDRAM, DDR and DDR2, and not DDR3 because it was not available at that time. This prompted TrueCrypt to release the following statement on their website.        A few key points to extract from here are that properly shutting down your computer reduces, if not completely enliminates this risk except in the case of encrypted system disks. What is meant by this is, for example, if your main operating system is Windows and you have encrypted that drive, this is your system drive and the master key for that drive is not cleared upon shutdown or restart. The solution is simply to never store anything sensitive on your system volume. Whether you use a partitioned drive or a USB stick that is encrypted, just make sure that your main drive that is booted into does not contain sensitive data. And if you have no other choice, then you need to separately encrypt the data inside the system volume with a different passphrase and private key so that even if they get into your system volume, they cannot access the other encrypted data you want to protect.      They can use these same techniques to sniff around for your PGP private key files in the RAM, so this is a very real threat in the case that if your computer is still powered on if they come to get you, they can use these techniques to retrieve data from your computer. However, there is a debate about whether or not this type of attack can persist even now into 2014 with newer types of RAM. I point to a random blog online and I make no judgement as to whether or not this is a legitimate claim, but it is interesting nonetheless.   The user claimed to be using a newer type of RAM called  DDR3. which is known to hold memory for a much shorter time than DDR2. And a newer research paper released in September 2013 tried to reproduce the findings of the 2008 research but using computers with DDR1, DDR2 and DDR3 and their findings were interesting.      So what does should you do? Number one, always shut down your computer when you are not around it or put it into hibernation mode, otherwise your sensitive documents could be lingering around in your RAM. Simply locking the screen will do you no good. Make sure your computer is using a DDR3 type of RAM, if possible. Some of you this means you need to upgrade. If you are unsure what kind of RAM your computer has, search online to find a tool that will detect it for you. Never store anything sensitive on an encrypted  system volume, because this attack can be used to break into the volume and anything unencrypted can be retrieved. If you are using a laptop, pull the battery out so that if you need to quickly pull the power, it will turn it off immediately. If you have time, shut down the computer, otherwise turn it off immediately so that it is not running. The more time you can waste are precious seconds where they cannot retrieve any data. So immediately shut things off if you do not have enough time to do a proper shutdown.      Consider putting a lock on your computer case, and if you want to go take it a step further, bolt it to the floor. That way the amount of time it would take them to get inside your computer would waste valuable minutes and more than likely render any recoverable memory useless. Some people have even suggested that you solder the RAM into the motherboard so they cannot take it out. This may help slow things down, but remember that cooling the memory down can preserve things for quite a while if you are using DDR1 or DDR2. With DDR3, you should be good to go and I believe with this realization, manufacturers will likely start looking at ways to encrypt RAM, but until that time you do need to be aware of this as a possible means for stealing your sensitive data and something you should keep in the back of your mind and prepare yourself for just in case.","Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption KeysAbstract Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard. Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not refreshed, they are not immediately erased, and their contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems â BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt â using no special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several strategies for partially mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them.https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/ [Abstract]http://citpsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oldsite-htdocs/pub/coldboot.pdf [Full Text];Unencrypted Data in RAMIt is important to note that TrueCrypt is disk encryption software, which encrypts only disks, not RAM (memory).Keep in mind that most programs do not clear the memory area (buffers) in which they store unencrypted (portions of) files they load from a TrueCrypt volume. This means that after you exit such a program, unencrypted data it worked with may remain in memory (RAM) until the computer is turned off (and, according to some researchers, even for some time after the power is turned off*). Also note that if you open a file stored on a TrueCrypt volume, for example, in a text editor and then force dismount on the TrueCrypt volume, then the file will remain unencrypted in the area of memory (RAM) used by (allocated to) the text editor. This applies to forced auto-dismount too.Inherently, unencrypted master keys have to be stored in RAM too. When a non-system TrueCrypt volume is dismounted, TrueCrypt erases its master keys (stored in RAM). When the computer is cleanly restarted (or cleanly shut down), all non-system TrueCrypt volumes are automatically dismounted and, thus, all master keys stored in RAM are erased by the TrueCrypt driver (except master keys for system partitions/drives â see below). However, when power supply is abruptly interrupted, when the computer is reset (not cleanly restarted), or when the system crashes, TrueCrypt naturally stops running and therefore cannot erase any keys or any other sensitive data. Furthermore, as Microsoft does not provide any appropriate API for handling hibernation and shutdown, master keys used for system encryption cannot be reliably (and are not) erased from RAM when the computer hibernates, is shut down or restarted.**To summarize, TrueCrypt cannot and does not ensure that RAM contains no sensitive data (e.g. passwords, master keys, or decrypted data). Therefore, after each session in which you work with a TrueCrypt volume or in which an encrypted operating system is running, you must shut down (or, if the hibernation file is encrypted, hibernate) the computer and then leave it powered off for at least several minutes (the longer, the better) before turning it on again. This is required to clear the RAM.* Allegedly, for 1.5-35 seconds under normal operating temperatures (26-44 Â°C) and up to several hours when the memory modules are cooled (when the computer is running) to very low temperatures (e.g. -50 Â°C). New types of memory modules allegedly exhibit a much shorter decay time (e.g. 1.5-2.5 seconds) than older types (as of 2008).** Before a key can be erased from RAM, the corresponding TrueCrypt volume must be dismounted. For non-system volumes, this does not cause any problems. However, as Microsoft currently does not provide any appropriate API for handling the final phase of the system shutdown process, paging files located on encrypted system volumes that are dismounted during the system shutdown process may still contain valid swapped-out memory pages (including portions of Windows system files). This could cause 'blue screen' errors. Therefore, to prevent 'blue screen' errors, TrueCrypt does not dismount encrypted system volumes and consequently cannot clear the master keys of the system volumes when the system is shut down or restarted.http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/unencrypted-data-in-ram;Now to test the actual cold-boot attack. Fill memory with around 1000 taint markers, just to be sure there are enough.Now shut down. Ostensibly, the markers could be recognizable in RAM after whole minutes, but Iâm impatient, so I just waited 10 seconds for the first test. Boot up, into the minimal linux installation. Load the kernel module: insmod ./rmem.ko. Run hunter.Nothing.Thatâs ok, though. There should be at least some data corruption. The default marker size is 128 bytes, so letâs set the hamming distance to 128, meaning that one bit out of every byte is allowed to be flipped. (Statistically, thatâs equivalent to a 25% corruption rate, since a corrupted bit has a 50% chance of remaining the same).Nothing.Looks like in 10 seconds, memory was completely corrupted. Letâs try a shorter interval: 2 seconds. Same results. Nothing is left of our âencryption keyâ.http://bytbox.net/blog/2013/01/cold-boot-attacks-overrated.html;Even though a target machine uses full disk encryption, cold boot attacks can retrieve unencrypted data from RAM. Cold boot attacks are based on the remanence effect of RAM which says that memory contents do not disappear immediately after power is cut, but that they fade gradually over time. This effect can be exploited by rebooting a running machine, or by transplanting its RAM chips into an analysis machine that reads out what is left in memory. In theory, this kind of attack is known since the 1990s. However, only in 2008, Halderman et al. have shown that cold boot attacks can be well deployed in practical scenarios. In the work in hand, we investigate the practicability of cold boot attacks. We verify the claims by Halderman et al. independently in a systematic fashion. For DDR1 and DDR2, we provide results from our experimental measurements that in large part agree with the original results. However, we also point out that we could not reproduce cold boot attacks against modern DDR3 chips. Our test set comprises 17 systems and system configurations, from which 5 are based on DDR3.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6657268&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6657268"

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:50:16","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Here is another fun tip that may or may not interest you, but I figured I would throw it in for you anyways.     I figured this out while trying to figure out an effective way to do a TOR -> VPN connection. You can do TOR -> TOR connection with Tails by using a program called  Tortilla, thus adding another layer for your adversaries to crack. Whether or not this is worth it, is completely up to you, but I am sharing in case it is something you want to do. This however currently only works for those using Windows because it was designed to be used by Windows users. Please note as well that this will noticeably slow down your connection since you are going through TOR twice. Here is the official homepage of Tortilla.  https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Tortilla     And the official download page for the prebuilt standalone exe below. There is a link to it on the home page if you do not trust me.  http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools/     The way you do this is very simple actually. You need to first download  TOR Expert Bundle from the TOR Project download page and install it on your computer or better yet your USB drive.  https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en     Next open the  tor.exe and just let it run until it says  Bootstrapped 100% Done. Next you want to run the tortilla.exe file and make sure you run it with Administrator privileges. Also, if you are running Windows Vista or later, you will likely get an error that this program does not have a valid certificate, because it is actually signed with something called a test-signed ceritifcate. In this case you need to allow test-signed drivers to run on your computer.      To do this, simply go to your Start Menu and type in the search box ""command"". When command comes up, you right click it, and click run as Administrator and it will open up a command prompt. Next type in the following command.  Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON and this will allow Windows to install test-signed drivers. Restart your computer and you will see in the bottom right hand corner after you restart  Test Mode Windows. Now you can run Tortilla. And let it connect to TOR. Remember to have  tor.exe from TOR Expert Bundle open first.     Finally, you open up Virtual Box or whatever Virtual Machine software you are using and click  Settings on the Tails virtual machine. Click on the  Network tab and change the drop down menu where it says  Attached To: to  Bridged Adapter and in the drop down menu below it called Name: Select Tortilla Adapter. Now your Virtual Machine, in this case Tails, will always connect to the internet  through Tortilla, which connects through TOR. And since Tails establishes its own connection to TOR, you will be running TOR over top of TOR. Again, you may or may not want to do this, but I am giving you the option should you want to.       If anyone is interested in learning more about the creator of Tortilla, he did a PowerPoint presentation at the 2013 Black Hat USA conference. Feel free to watch his talk at the YouTube link below. Please note however that YouTube is owned by Google and there are only about 57 views on the video, so the government will likely correlate users who watch that video with users from this forum. Make sure you do not watch the video on YouTube with your real IP address. At the very least use a VPN or find another site that has it hosted. Always be extra paranoid.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_jDPQU-8YQ",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:52:04","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Since we just finished a section on verifying downloads with signatures and public keys, I figured we should do a quick post on verifying messages by using the same two things, signatures and public keys.     Now for those of you who are members of the Silk Road Forums, you will notice that some people, mainly Moderators like to sign their messages with signatures. Let us look at an example of a signed message from Dread Pirate Roberts. The last message he left before going on his leave of absence.       So why should you care about this? What is the significance of signing a message? The reason is, in case somebody were to compromise DPR's account, due to having a weak password or possibly an exploit in the forum's coding, then the person would not be able to sign the messages without access to DPR's private key. So let us look at how we can verify this message left by DPR. First of all you need to visit Dread Pirate Roberts' profile page and grab his PGP public key. I am not going to post the key here for space reasons, but just visit his page at the following URL and import that key into your keyring.  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=1     Next, highlight the entire PGP signed message from top to bottom and copy it to your clipboard (Right click, Copy). You will see your little Clipboard icon in the top right of Tails turn red. Click on that clipboard and select  Decrypt/Verify. You should get the following results. One in the window on top and the other on the bottom.      Again we get the same warning we did when verifying our downloads, saying we have not verified that the PGP public key is authentic. We can see the signature name was made by Dread Pirate Roberts and the comment section has the Silk Road URL, so far so good. Now remember when we verified TOR? We wanted to check out the fingerprints to see if they matched. We do this by going to our key ring (Manage Keys), and selecting DPR's key, right clicking it and going to properties. Now move to the tab  Details and look under where it says Fingerprint: and compare the numbers in there to the numbers we got when we verified the signature. They should be the following.   5A48 F5D0 50E9 9052 62B4799D CCB2 38E4 7CFE DFBC     We have ourselves a match! So unless DPR's private key was compromised, we know that he himself was the one who wrote that message. So now you see why some people decide to sign their messages. It is a way of verifying that their account has not been compromised by verifying that the person in control of the account is the same person that is in control of the PGP private key.     Do you want to learn how to sign a message? It is very easy. Open up gedit Text Editor and type in a message. Next, select the message and copy it to your clipboard (Right Click - Copy) and then click on your clipboard icon up top and choose  Sign/Encrypt Clipboard with Public Keys. Do not choose a key from your list of PGP public keys unless you want to encrypt the message. If you want to encrypt the message to send to somebody's inbox or so that only one person can view it, then select their name and it will encrypt it with their PGP public key. In our case, we just want to sign the message without encrypting it, but you can certainly do both at the same time if you wanted to.     If you look down near the bottom you will see where it says  Sign message as: click on this and select your personal key. It will ask you for your passphrase because remember you are signing this with your private key. Once you enter it correctly, the PGP signed message will be copied to your clipboard and you can paste it anywhere (Right Click - Paste) that you want to. Here it what mine looked like.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA512  This is my PGP signed message for demonstration purposes. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJS0GiWAAoJEPuh6tSg81nyqXAP/2mEqvk9RP0FEHZi3edH9faV OmDoOostmzm90nGMGOOu4cuG0M6jgl7R3hfUZBE6zCh59MG8a9EDuUzpIT3U5nfd zS0GWtzUQKGXPXfJ1OvWlsA6Sm7TsEsviBBz5DJxyVLcJGNU6OLUVm7onxBLwfTq D1jAATIB43WJbDrq3XY9MF9GCoOLlcLeKNVa4m0JF582IvQJ05mSZXeXCueImvol FaflpLW5MKyJJ92a8uheB0pLHUQTLr6jZn6TcfKY9dK8puOam5k2TGut/Sm47uqc aMA1trXw4xntww/8X4QyL5SbSN7QVOFsy/g0b3Grp5OrConsfnsUoeRH5ArnxY0W ijPl92aTbZazvXspW2REkJ3yq+fWjuGrYHw8m7/YVBig+OSMuBUXhSE5Pjq95fyM bA1P7rF2fi7eRsl1z0qyETV3Bs1RltwvBUVIwj3SZNeVVoG5cHgpiPgGFq4S9Qke unIFeHy3YpBk90kLA1n8n61VnkKAUy0Dt9AoTJloeOqPtcgeKHVsFzxdPCBcSwqd XYnIx4lNeaw4OvHYgZsCMvFlUItSBGnFWLN9foQ8UybAUPGI9Z4sK2WmtyWK4fLl cXnYY9zt56Ji4DiVsQrEUamNTQEDGxpvBL/kQKRMKN6HviEXW+qr57LAo6t6sTQw KTV4uJkH1JxuOOhN9tIe =Nkox -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----     And if you want to verify it, check out my PGP public key in my profile and verify my PGP signature against my key! It is really that simple. But you might be asking, cannot somebody just change the message and copy the signature? No, changing the message will change the signature because the signature depends on both the message and the PGP private key. So if you change one single character of my signed message you will get the following error.   gpg: Signature made Fri 10 Jan 2014 09:39:34 PM UTC using RSA key ID A0F359F2gpg: BAD signature from ""Jolly Roger (They would live and die under it)""        So when should you sign a message? And when should you not sign a message? Great question. The majority of users should probably not sign messages unless they have to because it gives you plausible deniability. It is easier to deny posting certain things or certain communications you may have had with vendors or other people including law enforcement if you do not sign your messages, because you can always claim somebody else gained access to your account. It is harder to do this if you signed the message with your PGP private key. If you are dealing with somebody who wants to verify your identity and make sure that your current signature matches the public key they had on file for you from 6 months ago, then maybe they might get you to send a signed message. But again, all they really need to do is send you an encrypted message with your PGP public key they had on file, and if you cannot decrypt it, you are not who you say you are.      In real world application, developers can use PGP signed messages in News Announcements or perhaps new releases of their programs providing a download URL so that users can be sure the developer is the one posting the URL and not some malicious attacker who compromised the forum account of the developer and so forth. So for the average Silk Road forum user there really is not a lot of times when you should be signing messages unless you are a moderator or making a public announcement and so forth, but it is an option you now have in your arsenal, and now you can start verifying the signatures of the Administrators and Moderators in case you believe their accounts may have been compromised.","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA512Silk Road has not been compromised even if the allegations are true.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:53:32","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," By now if you have been following this thread, you should know that any type of messaging system is likely compromised or storing your data for an unknown period of time, and if you ever become a person of interest can be looked back upon for 5+ years.     This means things like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, Skype Messaging, Facebook Instant/Private Message, Text Messages, and other forms of communication are all likely being monitored to some degree, at the very least logging the meta data. But you should always treat everything as if those who are monitoring it can read the content of the email as well.      We have talked about communicating with PGP, we have talked about using TOR and hidden services, and we have talked about good practices of OpSec. But some of us want to be able to instant message somebody else. The good news is, you can do this with something called  TorChat.     TorChat is a decentralized anonymous instant messenger that uses Tor hidden services as its underlying Network, in other words it communicates over the Tor network through the .onion URL protocol. This provides  end to end encryption that we talked about in previous posts. It provides cryptographically secure text messaging and file transfers for business dealings, and confidential communication between two people. The best news, is that you can use TorChat on your Windows, Linux and your smart phones. A French developer released a version for MAC users, but it still in beta and should be used at your own risk. You can get TorChat for the iPhone in the Apple store, you can get TorChat in the Android Market as well, so you can even use it as a means of text messaging somebody else who also has TorChat.     In TorChat, every user has a unique alphanumeric ID consisting of 16 characters. This ID will be randomly created by Tor when the client is started the first time, it is basically the .onion address of a hidden service. TorChat clients communicate with each other by using Tor to contact the other's hidden service. For example, the first time you open TorChat your computer might generate  d0dj309jfj94jfgf.onion and from here on out,  d0dj309jfj94jfgf will be your TorChat ID that you give out to people that you want to be able to message you. Here is the home page of TorChat.   https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat  http://www.sourcemac.com/?page=torchat - MAC users     Unfortunately at this time, TorChat does not run properly in Tails, so you will either need to run it on your Windows, Linux or MAC system. It is pretty straight forward, download it, unpack it and run it and everything else should happen automatically for you. Once the avatar beside your TorChat ID turns green, you are online and same with your contacts. You can add contains by right clicking and choosing Add Contact and just enter their TorChat ID.     At this time there is some people debate as to whether or not TorChat is completely safe, and I would say that TorChat is about as safe as Tor is, just make sure you practice the same good practices you are used to. Do not give out personal information, if you are sending sensitive information use PGP encryption and so forth.     Here is another article on how TorChat works going into a little bit more detail. You can access it over the onion network.   http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Hacking_TorChat   UPDATE Another user had some additional input that I overlooked when writing this post that you should be aware of.  ","Torchat's security is unknown. It has not undergone a proper security audit, professional or otherwise, that I know of. It creates a hidden service on your computer leaving you vulnerable to deanonymization attacks that apply to all hidden services. It also seems to be a very basic protocol that looks like netcat over Tor. There is no way to decline a file transfer. It automatically starts the transfer, writing the file to /tmp which is a RAM-mounted tmpfs on Linux. Then you are supposed to save the file somewhere. Theoretically an attacker could transfer /dev/urandom while you are away from your computer until it fills up your RAM and crashes your computer. This would be great for inducing intersection attacks. Not sure though. If the kernel is managing the system correctly, it may just stop the transfer when you run out of RAM.Another thing is that once someone learns your Torchat ID there is no way to prevent them from knowing you are online, even if you remove them from your buddy list. The reason is because your Torchat instance is a hidden service that publishes a normal hidden service descriptor which anyone can download. There's no way to stop that. If you want to cut off contact with someone, you have to get a new Torchat ID. So you should be very conservative about handing out your Torchat ID and only give it to extremely trusted associates."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:55:23","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Some of you may have seen links to different websites on these forums. In fact my thread is full of them.      As you probably know by now, a hidden service is a website that uses a .onion address and a clearnet site uses the regular internet. You must be on TOR to access the onion network, whereas clearnet sites can be accessed from any browser. So why should you be careful when visiting clearnet sites?     When you see an article, link or video posted on the Silk Road forums, please note, that you should only be viewing those videos over TOR or possibly but as a last resort use a VPN and here is why. Let us use YouTube for example. YouTube is owned by Google, Google tracks  everything. YouTube keeps track of which IP addresses search for what videos, and tons of meta data about it's users.      When a link to a YouTube video is posted on the SR forums, we likely have to use our regular browsers to watch it because Tor browser is not good for watching flash videos. But the problem is, if a post on SR was written on January 10, 2014 recommending a video, and this video only has 500 views, perhaps this video has been up for a few months and did not end up being very popular. And then within the few days that this article was posted, 50 people viewing the Silk Road forum watch this video. The number of views just went up in a short period of time.      It is pretty easy to correlate that it is possible, that the people who watched that YouTube video, especially since it is not a popular video came from Silk Road, and if you made the mistake of using your real IP address, you have now been added to a list of people of interest. And if you do this multiple times with different YouTube videos, then they start to see a pattern and before you know it, they are confident that you are coming to watch these videos from Silk Road because every time a video is posted on Silk Road forums, your IP address comes up to watch this video.     But if you use a VPN, this makes things a little harder in that they are not as easily going to be able to link the video to you yet. But once they see a VPN address constantly popping up on those videos being linked from the forums, they might submit a court order to monitor the activities of the users of the VPN. HideMyAss was one of the most well known examples of VPNs being ordered to hand over information on their users.      The same thing goes with all clearnet sites. You never know who is monitoring their activity, and if it is an old article, more than a couple of years, then you can almost bet that the number of people viewing that article are down. So when somebody posts a clearnet link on the forums and people visit that link using an unprotected IP address, then the LE can start to correlate patterns against you. Of course, these articles and links are not as likely to be visited without TOR from the SR forums because you need TOR to view the forums, but especially things like YouTube videos since TOR does not work well with YouTube can be problematic.      So what can you do to protect yourself? Ask yourself first, do I really need to watch that YouTube video? Is it something important that I need to see? If it is, you might consider an option that I spoke about earlier called Tortilla, but it is only available to Windows users. I talk it about it at the following article.  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=14555.msg304569#msg304569     You will run a Virtual Machine such as Debian, but do not connect to TOR using the Virtual Machine. The VM uses a bridged apapter and routes all traffic through Tortilla which routes all traffic through TOR on your Windows host OS without having to use the TOR browser on your VM. MAC users and Linux users may just want to view the YouTube video in a one time use proxy that does not keep any logs or maybe a public wifi network that has lots of users on it daily.      There is an infamous case of a murderer who called the sister of his victim from his victim's cell phone. He would call from her Time Square in New York and taunt her and talk about how she was torturing her sister and the police put a trace on the phone. Unfortunately because Time Square is such a crowded place, even with all the cameras, they were unable to pinpoint exactly which person was making the call on that phone and they never ended up catching the guy. He ended up ditching the phone after he finally killed his victim. They knew he was a guy walking around Time Square on a cell phone but if you have ever been to Time Square, you know that there are millions of people doing the exact same thing, he just blended right in.     So you may want to use a public wifi in a crowded area that has many users all day long to watch a video and keep your IP address safe. If you cannot watch videos safely without identifying yourself, then do not watch them. It is as simple as this. Yes I know it is annoying that Tor does not work well with flash videos, but it is better than being thrown in jail where you will never be able to watch any YouTube videos.      The main reason I wrote this post was to remind you that correlating two users together on the internet is easier than you think. Once you start developing patterns and leaving your footprints behind, the LE have an unlimited storage space available to them to keep track of everything you do. Remember how Sabu got caught? He just logged onto IRC with his real IP address,  one time. One time is all it takes for them to take you down. Always think before opening a link, what will this website identify about me? ",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T16:57:20","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," First thing I want you to do is find a secure way of watching this video. Remember they log everyone who watches these videos and since I am linking you to them from Silk Road, they will be watched even closer.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x74iq0_compromising-electromagnetic-emanat_tech     This video shows how using a strong antenna, sitting in a van outside your home, the FBI could be picking up on your keystrokes on a  wired keyboard. In fact many people speculate that the new smart meters installed in many homes already have this technology to determine everything you are doing in your home electronically. Wired and wireless keyboards emit electromagnetic waves, because they contain electronic components. This electromagnetic radiation could reveal sensitive information such as keystrokes as shown in the video. Every electrmagnetic wave is unique to the device using it, which gives a person spying on you the ability to tell the difference between you using your computer versus the dishwasher.  According to the people who did this experiment, they were able to extend the range up to 20 meters using relatively cheap technology. This was for wired keyboards by the way, and they go on to explain that wireless keyboards and mouses are even easier. Which brings us to another area of interest, wireless transmissions. Things like wireless keyboards and wireless mice (or mouses?) are vulnerable to eavesdropping as well. If they are not using a strong enough encryption to send data to the receiver, anyone can be listening in on your keystrokes and mouse activity. Probably something most people never thought about either, this is on top of the electromagnetic waves that can also be picked up.      Are you using wireless technology? How old is it? Might be time to upgrade your equipment. 10 meters is about 33 feet, but remember the technology available to the government could potentially reach beyond that. Then there are other things people forget such as wireless monitors which broadcast your screen to a receiver that can be picked up. Just think about the old antennas people used to have on top of their homes, and how far away those could pick up signals from TV stations, if you had one of those pointed at you in a van across the street, there is no doubt they could be eavesdropping on your activities inside.      One researcher was able to use a wireless signal sent by a smart meter from up to 300 meters away (900 feet) to find out which house it was coming from and what the current power consumption was in plain text. She was then able to use this information to determine when people were and were not home based on average spikes in consumption since the meters pulse every 30 seconds.       Things like automatic timers that flip switches might be worth investing in to always make it look like someone is home until security researchers start looking into ways to avoid the wide open door we are giving to anyone who wants to find data about us.      What can you do about these types of eavesdropping? Not a whole lot unless you want to start turning into a tin-foil hat type of person. There are some fun things you can do if you want to go crazy with it though as recommended by the following site.  http://www.lessemf.com/smart.html      There are lots of other things on there as well like drapes, curtains, garments, fabrics and so forth which disrupt the tranmission of these signals. It is completely up to you what you want to do, I am just giving you the options and the education so you can make an educated decision of how far you want to go to protect your privacy. ","Microsoft has upgraded the weak encryption found on todayâs mass-market wireless keyboards with a new design that uses 128-bit AES to secure communication to and from the PC.Hitherto, keyboard encryption has been weak, with keys chosen from a small palette of possibilities, with one hacking group claiming in 2009 that it had developed a tool specifically to sniff keystrokes from Microsoft keyboards at a range up to a 10 metres.http://news.techworld.com/security/3284218/new-microsoft-wireless-keyboard-gets-128-bit-encryption/;The data sent was in plain text and carried the identification number of the meter and its reading.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.20","2014-01-15T17:46:47","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Here are a few recommendations that may slip by the average user on these forums.  1.  Never leave your computer that you use for your freedom fighting unattended. This may seem like a no-brainer, but if you have kids, or a spouse or a sibling that does not understand what you do on the computer and they decide to hop on your account and sign into their email, Facebook or doing things that could compromise your location while on that computer because they simply did not know, this could potentially cause you problems.      Maybe you are connecting through multiple layers like this TOR -> VPN(1) -> TOR -> VPN(2), so that is 4 layers and VPN(2) is the IP address that everyone sees. Then your child or spouse goes on to their email with that IP address, then signs off without your knowledge. That VPN is now linked to you. And we remember how when under pressure, companies will likely give out information about their customers to avoid fines, shut downs and prosecution.  2.  Do not tell your family members what you are doing, just instruct them not to touch your computer. Keep it passworded. - You should never tell anyone what you are doing on your computer because if law enforcement ever did show up, they would question your family and friends about you. If they honestly do not know, then they cannot be held in contempt of court, so it is better to keep them in the dark. Or maybe the police might scare them into giving up all your secrets because they tell your family that if they do not confess that yourself and them will be going to jail, possibly for a long time. Just password your computer and never leave it unattended with the screen unlocked.   3.  If you use multiple layers to connect, make sure you regularly check to make sure all your layers are in tact. VPNs can drop sometimes without warning and while you should never set yourself up so that if one layer drops you lose everything, just keep in mind when one drops that you may need to adjust the way you handle yourself online until you get that next layer up. This is one of the reaons I like Tortilla so much, if my TOR layer does not work, it does not bypass it and go to my next layer, instead it just stops working altogether. When VPNs drop, your computer bypasses the dropped VPN and moves onto the next layer, which in some cases could be your real IP address. Just something to keep in mind.   4.  Do not use the same password for multiple forums, marketplaces, emails and so forth. - Expect that one or more of the websites you are registered with is storing your password in plain text. This means that if somebody finds an exploit in the software and is able to dump the entire database, they can find your password. And if you used the same password for other sites, and god forbid with the same username as well, your entire list of accounts is compromised. Always use different passwords and keep them strong. Do not let anything about your password identify how you choose passwords, or identify anything personal about you. ",""

Andy Greenberg, Forbes StaffCovering the worlds of data security, privacy and hacker culture.Security1/27/2014 @ 12:16PM http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/01/27/winklevoss-funded-bitcoin-startup-ceo-arrested-in-silk-road-investigation/ (clearnet)Winklevoss-Funded Bitcoin Startup's CEO Arrested In Silk Road InvestigationThe widening circle of arrests in the investigation of the Silk Road drug market sites just extended into the heart of the Bitcoin community.The Department of Justice announced Monday that itâs arrested Charlie Shrem, CEO of the Bitcoin payment processor BitInstant and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, as well as Robert Faiella, an alleged underground Bitcoin exchanger, and accuses the two of selling more than $1 million worth of bitcoins to users of the Silk Road anonymous black market for drugs. Shrem was arrested at JFK airport in New York Sunday, and Faiella at his home in Cape Coral, Florida. Both have been charged with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and BitInstant appears to be offline as of Monday morning.Arrested BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem.âTruly innovative business models donât need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,â Manhattan U.S. attorney Preet Bharara wrote in a statement. âWe will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.âThe Forbes E-book On Bitcoin Secret Money: Living on Bitcoin in the Real World, by Forbes staff writer Kashmir Hill, can be bought in Bitcoin or legal tender.The arrest of Shrem in particular will shake the core of the Bitcoin community. Shrem has been a highly visible Bitcoin entrepreneur and a vocal leader of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group thatâs advocated for Bitcoinâs legality and lobbied against over-burdensome government regulation of the digital currency. Shremâs startup, the Bitcoin payment processor BitInstant, received $1.5 million in seed funding last year in an investment round led by Bitcoin moguls Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. âCharlie has been in the space for a very long time, and he has an impeccable reputation among Bitcoiners. He knows everyone in the space and everyone in the space knows him,â Cameron Winklevoss told TechCrunch last year. âHe would be in that category of someone who lives, breathes, and sleeps Bitcoin.âIn an interview with Forbesâ Kashmir Hill last November, Shrem said that his companyâand he himselfâhad been blacklisted from holding U.S. bank accounts. âIâve been kicked out of every major bank in New York,â Shrem said at the time. âChase , Wells Fargo , Citibank, U.S. Bank. And once they shut down your business account, they ban your social security number too meaning you canât keep a personal account.âHe told Hill that Chase Bank had notified him in April that BitInstantâs account was being suspended, and he raced home on a four-connection flight from Hong Kong to move the money. Those banking woes had caused Bitinstant to suspend operations at the time.In an indictment against the pair, Faiella is described as running an anonymous exchange on Silk Roadâs site called BTCKing. Shrem is accused of processing payments to the exchange, despite being aware of its illegal nature. âNot only did Shrem knowingly allow Faiella to use [BitInstant's] services to buy bitcoins for his Silk Road customers, he personally processed Faillaâs transactions, gave Faiella discounts on his high-volume orders, willfully failed to file suspicious activity reports about Faiella, and deliberately helped Faiella cirumvent the Companyâs [anti-money laundering] restrictions, even though it was Shremâs job to enforce them.âAn archive of vendor profiles from the now-defunct Silk Road shows that BTCKing offered to sell any amount of bitcoins worth less than $1,000 for a 10% fee, and listed more than 300 transactions.âThe King is the EASIEST and CHEAPEST ANYWHEREâ¦. REMEMBER!..this is totally legal, youâre just buying some BTC, so REST EASY!â¦We use a professional Payment Processor to ensure your Securityâ¦Cash deposit is a widely used modern day payment method â¦INVEST IN BTCâ¦.ORDER IN CONFIDENCE NOW!âSilk Roadâs users seemed to appreciate the anonymous exchange. âPerfect transaction, long live the kingâ reads one review, and another applauds BTCKingâs âOutstanding service & lightning fast transaction!!âThe indictment cites BitInstantâs website as limiting cash deposits to $1,000 per day, noting that âwe will not have criminals as clients and will not assist money laundering operations.âMessages dug up between Shrem and Faiella tell a different story. âWe know you are violating our Terms of Service and we know you are reselling on the Silk Road.

Andy Greenberg, Forbes Staff Covering the worlds of data security, privacy and hacker culture. Security 1/27/2014 @ 12:16PM  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/01/27/winklevoss-funded-bitcoin-startup-ceo-arrested-in-silk-road-investigation/ (clearnet)  Winklevoss-Funded Bitcoin Startup's CEO Arrested In Silk Road Investigation  The widening circle of arrests in the investigation of the Silk Road drug market sites just extended into the heart of the Bitcoin community.  The Department of Justice announced Monday that itâs arrested Charlie Shrem, CEO of the Bitcoin payment processor BitInstant and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, as well as Robert Faiella, an alleged underground Bitcoin exchanger, and accuses the two of selling more than $1 million worth of bitcoins to users of the Silk Road anonymous black market for drugs. Shrem was arrested at JFK airport in New York Sunday, and Faiella at his home in Cape Coral, Florida. Both have been charged with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and BitInstant appears to be offline as of Monday morning.  Arrested BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem.  âTruly innovative business models donât need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,â Manhattan U.S. attorney Preet Bharara wrote in a statement. âWe will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.â The Forbes E-book On Bitcoin Secret Money: Living on Bitcoin in the Real World, by Forbes staff writer Kashmir Hill, can be bought in Bitcoin or legal tender.  The arrest of Shrem in particular will shake the core of the Bitcoin community. Shrem has been a highly visible Bitcoin entrepreneur and a vocal leader of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group thatâs advocated for Bitcoinâs legality and lobbied against over-burdensome government regulation of the digital currency. Shremâs startup, the Bitcoin payment processor BitInstant, received $1.5 million in seed funding last year in an investment round led by Bitcoin moguls Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. âCharlie has been in the space for a very long time, and he has an impeccable reputation among Bitcoiners. He knows everyone in the space and everyone in the space knows him,â Cameron Winklevoss told TechCrunch last year. âHe would be in that category of someone who lives, breathes, and sleeps Bitcoin.â  In an interview with Forbesâ Kashmir Hill last November, Shrem said that his companyâand he himselfâhad been blacklisted from holding U.S. bank accounts. âIâve been kicked out of every major bank in New York,â Shrem said at the time. âChase , Wells Fargo , Citibank, U.S. Bank. And once they shut down your business account, they ban your social security number too meaning you canât keep a personal account.â  He told Hill that Chase Bank had notified him in April that BitInstantâs account was being suspended, and he raced home on a four-connection flight from Hong Kong to move the money. Those banking woes had caused Bitinstant to suspend operations at the time.  In an indictment against the pair, Faiella is described as running an anonymous exchange on Silk Roadâs site called BTCKing. Shrem is accused of processing payments to the exchange, despite being aware of its illegal nature. âNot only did Shrem knowingly allow Faiella to use [BitInstant's] services to buy bitcoins for his Silk Road customers, he personally processed Faillaâs transactions, gave Faiella discounts on his high-volume orders, willfully failed to file suspicious activity reports about Faiella, and deliberately helped Faiella cirumvent the Companyâs [anti-money laundering] restrictions, even though it was Shremâs job to enforce them.â  An archive of vendor profiles from the now-defunct Silk Road shows that BTCKing offered to sell any amount of bitcoins worth less than $1,000 for a 10% fee, and listed more than 300 transactions.âThe King is the EASIEST and CHEAPEST ANYWHEREâ¦. REMEMBER!..this is totally legal, youâre just buying some BTC, so REST EASY!â¦We use a professional Payment Processor to ensure your Securityâ¦Cash deposit is a widely used modern day payment method â¦INVEST IN BTCâ¦.ORDER IN CONFIDENCE NOW!â  Silk Roadâs users seemed to appreciate the anonymous exchange. âPerfect transaction, long live the kingâ reads one review, and another applauds BTCKingâs âOutstanding service & lightning fast transaction!!â  The indictment cites BitInstantâs website as limiting cash deposits to $1,000 per day, noting that âwe will not have criminals as clients and will not assist money laundering operations.â  Messages dug up between Shrem and Faiella tell a different story. âWe know you are violating our Terms of Service and we know you are reselling on the Silk Road. This is illegal,â Shrem wrote to BTCKing in January of 2012. But even then, and despite several conversations with a BitInstant co-founder who asked Shrem to ban BTCKing, Shrem is accused of continuing to process his transactions. (The indictment also alleges that Shrem himself bought pot brownies from a Silk Road vendor, as further evidence that he was aware of the illegal uses of the site.)  â[BTCKing] has not broken any laws and silk road itself is not illegal,â Shrem wrote to his co-founder. âWe make good profit from him.â  Later, Shrem is alleged to have offered Faiella discounts on processing large transactionsâas high as $40,000âand advice about how to avoid detection by the banks processing the cash payments for BitInstantâs bitcoins. âIf I were you, Iâd spread it out over 2-3 branches to play it safe,â Shrem allegedly wrote to Faiella. âIt should process fine, but better to be safe [than] sorry.

I would only quibble with you in the sense that one should ALWAYS have operated in maximum shadow, regardless of whether one was involved in illegal activity or not. I don't break the law, but I DO value my privacy, and I have always used the best available tools and techniques to ensure that I cannot be identified.  You don't need to be involved in criminal activity to value your privacy.   In my view, one of the saddest, and most dangerous sentiments I've ever hard expressed is/was a variant on one originally expressed by Reichsprogaganda Minister Josef Goebbels:  ""You have nothing to fear, if you have nothing to hide.""

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","9754.0","2015-06-06T00:28:05","3 Felonies A Day -- every American should read this","General Discussion/Legal","How can the average American commit three arguable felonies in the course of a given day? Consider these hypothetical examplesâalong with their real-life parallelsâin which vague and broad federal laws have made honest citizens into federal felons.       âº Violation of Foreign Law (The Lacey) Act     âº Federal Wilderness Act     âº Honest Services Fraud     âº Espionage Act     âº Obstruction of Justice     âº Computer Fraud and Abuse Act     âº Wire Fraud     âº Providing Material Support for Terrorists     âº False Statements to a Federal Official  â¢ Violation of Foreign Law (The Lacey Act)   Hypothetical: You are a small business proprietor who supplies restaurants with fish and produce. One shipment of lobsters comes in unusual packagingâusually sent in cardboard boxes, these lobsters arrived in clear packaging. By purchasing this shipment, you have arguably committed a federal felony. The imported lobsters originated in a country that bans the shipping of lobsters in clear plastic bags, and the U.S. Lacey Act makes criminal an importer who violates âany foreign lawââregardless of whether you knew of the foreign regulations.  Real-life example: American businesswoman Diane Huang was convicted under this far-reaching provision, despite her unawareness of the supposed Honduran law banning the shipment of lobsters in clear plastic bags. Lack of criminal intent, the Washington Legal Foundation argued on behalf of Huang and her co-defendants, should make the governmentâs criminal charges inappropriate. To make matters worse, the Honduran law governing such shipments was not valid at the time of Huangâs arrestâa fact that the Honduran government pointed out to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Nonetheless, the federal court found Huang guilty in March 2003 and imposed a two-year prison sentence.   â¢ Federal Wilderness Act  Hypothetical: You are an avid outdoorsman, and youâve decided that your next thrill-ride is a snowmobiling trip in Colorado. You set out on a sunny day, but you soon find foreboding clouds above. Before you can turn back, a blizzard has set in. Lost from your original path, and with your snowmobile out of gas, you abandon it and walk to seek rescue. Luckily, a park ranger eventually finds you. After authorities retrieve your vehicle, however, you come to find that you have arguably committed a federal felony. When you strayed from your path, you ended up snowmobiling in federally-protected wilderness area, thus violating the Federal Wilderness Act.  Real-life example: Well-known automobile racer Bobby Unser found himself in this position in 1997. He spent two nights in blizzard conditions; when he was finally rescued by Forest Service rangers, they charged him with a provision of the Wildness Act that prevented motor vehicles in protected areas. His presumed accidentâhe claimed he never meant to end up on that territoryâdid not spare him from the subsequent charges.    â¢ Honest Services Fraud  Hypothetical: You are a salaried employee at an insurance company. You work hard and have earned the respect of your peers. One day, your cousin calls and tells you that he has an extra ticket to tomorrowâs gameâa sold-out matchup with your hometown teamâs rival. You contemplate calling in âsickâ in order to attend the game. Though you recognize that it is slightly off-color to deceive your superiors and that you could possibly be reprimanded by the company, you nonetheless realize that everyone does it occasionally and it is deemed a perk of the job. So you decide to take a sick day. You have arguably just committed a federal felony. Your conduct could have been seen as a âschemeâ to defraud the company of its âintangible rightâ to your âHonest Services.â  Real-life example: This hypothetical has yet to come to our attention (although it wouldnât be shocking if such a case actually exists), but that doesnât mean the conduct isnât covered by the infamously vague federal law. In fact, after the Supreme Court declined to hear an âhonest servicesâ case in February 2009, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a rare dissent to his colleaguesâ refusal to review the conviction. In this dissent, Scalia wrote that the law has been used to criminalize a âstaggeringly broad swath of behavior,â and if the 28-word statute âis taken seriously and carried to its logical conclusion, presumably the statute also renders criminalâ¦a salaried employeeâs phoning in sick to go to a ball game.â This admonition has led the high court to accept three cases that challenge the scope of the âhonest servicesâ statute in the current term.   â¢ Espionage Act  Hypothetical: You are an investigate journalist working in Washington, D.C. In the course of writing a lengthy expose, a government employee offers sensitive information related to national security. The published version of your article contains a quote from this anonymous source. You have just committed an arguable federal felony. Enterprising federal prosecutors have used provisions from the federal Espionage Act to criminalize the receiving and distribution of confidential national security information by private individuals under circumstances where the statute appears to cover only governmental officials.  Real-life example: A recent federal caseâinvolving not journalists, but lobbyistsâshowed that this scenario is a distinct possibility. After all, prosecutors attempted to apply this nearly century-old statute to lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and at least one federal judge agreed that the charges had merit, despite the fact that lobbyists donât have the same confidentiality obligations as government employees. Such a stretching of this provision undoubtedly leaves the press and investigative reportersâin exercising what they deem to be their constitutional rightsâvulnerable to federal prosecution.   â¢ Obstruction of Justice  Hypothetical: You are the parent of a teenage son. You discover illegal drugs hidden in his bedroom. Instead of contacting the police, you decide to destroy the narcotics and punish his transgressions on your own. Unbeknownst to you, the police had launched an investigation just days before. Because you have destroyed evidence in an ongoing investigation, you have just committed an arguable federal felony:  Real-life example: Philip Russell, a lawyer from Greenwich, Connecticut, was indicted in 2007 for obstruction of justice. A church had contacted this well-respected attorney when it found images of child pornography on an employeeâs computer. Russell knew that child porn is illegal even to possess (âcontrabandâ) and that holding, rather than destroying it, arguably would be criminal. He decided to destroy the images in the best interest of his client. He didnât know that the government had launched an investigation of the church employee just days before. For this, he was charged with obstruction of justice, and eventually pleaded to a lesser crime in an agreement with prosecutors. With this same logic, prosecutors could indict parents that choose to destroyârather than report to officialsânarcotics that they find in the possession of their son or daughter.   â¢ Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  Hypothetical: You are a software engineer working for a company that provides e-mail services to customers. Your expertise with the program leads you to discover a flaw in the system that could jeopardize email security. You immediately notify your employer, but your employer decides it is not an urgent matter and declines to fix the problem. A few months pass and youâfrustrated with your employerâs lack of concernâdecide to quit. You then take it upon yourself to email some of the patrons about the software insecurity. You have just committed an arguable federal felony. The federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act outlaws anyone from sending information, with the intent to cause damage, to a protected computer. The lawâs definition of damage includes âimpairment to integrityâ of a system or dataâa phrase so ambiguous that could turn a well-intentioned whistle blower into a convicted felon.  Real-life example: In 2003, Bret McDanel became a convicted felon after prosecutors pursued his altruistic whistle-blowing using this vague federal law.   â¢ Wire Fraud  Hypothetical: You decide, as a prank, to create a fake username on the popular social-networking site, Facebook. Your digital identity is that of a famous athlete. You tell your friends they are inferior to your other-wordly skills. You have just committed an arguable federal felony. Federal Wire Fraud provisions have proven so elastic that this seemingly innocuous conduct could be defined as a federal crime.  Real-life example: The so-called âMyspace suicideâ made headlines in 2009, when Missouri mother Lori Drew allegedly impersonated a teenage boy to taunt her neighbor, a young woman. After the young womanâs suicide, the case became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre for those looking to criminalize âcyber bullyingââa decidedly modern phenomenon by which Internet users taunt and annoy, perhaps belittle, others. In the federal prosecution of Ms. Drew, prosecutors charged that she violated the Myspace terms of use, and thus had violated the aforementioned Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Though the judge dismissed this charge this time, he did so only after a jury conviction, and thereâs little reason to think a similar case could be brought on the equally elastic federal wire fraud provisions. And, even if that fails, Congress is currently considering a federal law that would specifically outlaw âcyber bullying,â or the transmission of âany communication, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person, using electronic means.â As Harvey Silverglate pointed out when he testified against the bill in September 2009, the vaguely-worded law, if passed, would threaten the expression of almost every blogger, journalist, and publisher who uses the internet.   â¢ Providing Material Support for Terrorists  Hypothetical: You are a website-designer, and youâve been commissioned to develop the web presence of a charity. The charity focuses on teaching traditional religious customs and practices. On the website, you link to other organizations that share some, but not all, of your charityâs views. You have just committed an arguable federal felony. Because information on the websites to which you link contained advocacy of religious extremism, you have broken the federal Patriot Act provision of Providing Material Support to Terrorists.  Real-life example: Sami Omar al-Hussayen, a Saudi graduate student in Idaho, was reportedly the first person to be indicted under the USA Patriot Act, which expanded the notion of âmaterial supportâ for terrorism to include those who render âexpert advice or assistanceâ to the terrorists and their cause. The feds alleged that al-Hussayen, in his role as Webmaster for a Muslim charity website, was providing such assistance. The charity sites focused on normal religious training, but the indictment asserted that if a user followed enough links off his site, he would find violent, anti-American comments on other sites. Such was the elasticity provided by Patriot Act provisions. A properly instructed jury acquitted, but the set of anti-terrorism laws leave little reason to believe that prosecutors will not infringe on important civil liberties in their pursuit of terrorist suspects, as indeed they have in various parts of the nation. In fact, an upcoming Supreme Court caseâHolder v. Humanitarian Law Project âchallenges the vagueness of this federal statute.   â¢ False Statements to a Federal Official  Hypothetical: You and your family are spending the day in a national park. After a few miles of hiking, you decide itâs time for a lunch break. You eat, finish, and throw away your trash. Your son, however, isnât so careful â he leaves behind a few leftover items from his meal. As you leave your picnic area, a park ranger asks if you or your family has left trash in the area. You tell him that youâve cleaned up after yourself. You have just committed an arguable federal felony: False Statements to a Federal Official. Any false statement made to a government official â even when it is made in conversation and not under oath nor in writing â can leave a citizen vulnerable to a âfalse statementâ charge.  Real-life example: Consider the case of Emadeddin Muntasser, a Massachusetts man (and one-time client of Harvey Silverglate) whom the feds suspected of having terrorist ties. When a federal judge tossed out charges claiming that Muntasserâs charity organization was linked to terrorist activity, the government was left with only a âfalse statementsâ charge. This was based on a single FBI interview in which Muntasser supposedly lied about his travel activity. A close examination of the transcript revealed that, when he voluntarily agreed to be questioned by two FBI agents, he had initially denied travelling to Afghanistan, but then immediately ârequested to consult with an attorneyâ and asked interrogators to ânot pursue the issue of travel to Afghanistan.â To any reasonable person, this would signify that Muntasser was not purposefully trying to deceive interrogators, but rather had doubts about his original answer and felt he needed advice from legal counsel. Nonetheless, he was convicted on this single count of âfalse statements,â which he has appealed. The text of the statute makes a false statement to any federal officialâwhether it is a park ranger or FBI interrogatorâa federal crime. And the definition of âfalseâ is often very strained and contrary to common sense, as in the Muntasser case.  Source: http://www.threefeloniesaday.com/Youtoo/tabid/86/Default.aspx  ",""

In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court of Canada said that failure to do both would still leave HIV-positive Canadians open to prosecution if there remained a ârealistic possibility of transmission of HIVâ through unprotected sex. When that ârealistic possibility of transmissionâ exists, HIV poses a âsignificant risk of serious bodily harmâ under the law, the court said.  âA significant risk of serious bodily harm is established by a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV. On the evidence before us, a realistic possibility of transmission is negated by evidence that the accusedâs viral load was low at the time of intercourse and that condom protection was used,â Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote for the court.  However, she warned, âthe general proposition that a low viral load combined with condom use negates a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV does not preclude the common law from adapting to future advances in treatment and to circumstances where risk factors other than those considered in the present case are at play.â  The ruling Friday amends the test for serious bodily harm, updating a 14-year-old ruling that first made it illegal to not inform a sexual partner about oneâs HIV diagnosis.  While there is no cure for HIV, advances in modern medicine have made it manageable to live with the virus. McLachlin wrote that âcondom use is not a fail-safeâ because the condom could fail, nor is antiretroviral therapy âa safe-sex strategy.â  âAntiretroviral therapy, alone, still exposes a sexual partner to a realistic possibility of transmission,â McLachlin wrote. âHowever, on the evidence before us, the ultimate percentage risk of transmission resulting from the combined effect of condom use and low viral load is clearly extremely low â so low that the risk is reduced to a speculative possibility rather than a realistic possibility.â  The court did not set an actual definition for a low viral load. In the ruling, the court pointed out that the viral load of an untreated HIV patient can be as high as a few million âcopiesâ of the virus per millilitre of blood. A patient on antiretroviral treatments can shrink levels of the virus to less than 50 copies per millilitre.  In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that anyone who failed to disclose their HIV status was putting their partners in âsignificant risk of serious bodily harmâ that could lead to a charge of sexual assault or aggravated assault and the possibility of life in prison.  Since then, more than 130 people have been charged criminally under the law.  The new ruling rejects a request from prosecutors to expand the law for a blanket disclosure rule.  Interveners in the case had argued that the law was a public health issue, deterring people from seeking HIV tests, treatment or disclosure out of fear of future prosecution. The court, however, found the evidence presented to be inconclusive.  âI cannot accept this argument. The only âevidenceâ was studies presented by interveners suggesting that criminalization âprobablyâ acts as a deterrent to HIV testing,â McLachlin wrote. âThe conclusions in these studies are tentative â¦ They fail to provide an adequate basis to justify judicial reversal of the accepted place of the criminal law in this domain.â  In making the ruling, the court also upheld an appeal court decision to acquit a Montreal woman of aggravated assault and sexual assault charges, and reinstated three convictions against former Winnipeg resident Clato Lual Mabior.  Mabior was deported to South Sudan in February.  In 2008, Mabior was convicted for failing to disclose his HIV-positive status to nine women he had sex with in Winnipeg, including a 12-year-old girl. He was originally convicted on six counts of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to 14 years in prison, although with credit for time served, that sentence was reduced to nine years.  An appeal court overturned four of those convictions, arguing that using a condom or having a low viral load negated any risk of harm, meaning he didnât have to disclose his status.  Mabior was deported in February, but not before the Crown appealed the acquittals.  In a Quebec case, a woman only identified as D.C. in court documents was convicted of aggravated assault for failing to disclose her HIV status to her former spouse. Charges against her were filed after the two had an acrimonious breakup with the man convicted of assaulting D.C. and her son. The Quebec Court of Appeal overturned her conviction, saying that her viral load was undetectable and didnât pose a significant risk.  Zaphod ",""

Feds confiscated the wood.   But in the end, it turned out there was no such law in the originating country. Now my memory fails me - I can't remember what reason was given as a motivation for the Feebs to do that. Gibson's not a big trouble-maker fostering sedition, lol...

There was some speculation that the tip-off was from a competitor, who was perhaps hoping the shipment of lobster would be seized and forfeited.

On one of them, they would do torture and molestation acts on camera BY REQUEST.  The asshole got busted the other day. Exactly HOW he got busted is something you should pay attention to.  (clearnet) http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/heroes-of-task-force-argos-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-track-shannon-mccoole-and-shut-down-sickening-pedophile-site/story-fnn8dlfs-1227365887039  Here's most of the article: ""The Courier-Mail can reveal Task Force Argos investigators were behind the high-profile arrest of carer Shannon Grant McCoole last year.  McCoole had sexually abused at least seven children in his care and his arrest sparked a royal commission into the child-protection system in South Australia.  But the clean-cut public servant was hiding another secret â Queenslandâs Argos had identified him as the head administrator of a 45,000-member pedophile site on the âdark webâ.  The site â which cannot be named under court suppression orders â required members to post âhard core pre-teenâ child abuse videos or images every 30 days.  Members used Tor computer software to mask their identity, making them almost impossible to trace.  Shannon Grant McCoole was identified him as the head administrator of a 45,000-member pedophile site.  The longer they stayed on the site the more access they were granted, with VIP forums and a private area for people who posted new or rare content.  At the top of the hierarchy was an ultra-exclusive âproducerâs areaâ, reserved for members who abused children on demand and posted footage or photos every two weeks.  To prove it was original material, the producers displayed their handle, or username, on notes during the abuse and staged the scene with a designated item.  Because of a series of other take-downs of pedophile networks on the dark web, the site became the biggest of its kind with more than 360,000 posts and 90,000 topics.  For years, Australian and international police had known a mystery Australian man was running the forum but had been frustratingly unable to identify him.  Argos in particular had been looking into the site since mid-2013, when they had arrested a pedophile during a separate investigation and discovered he was a VIP member.  However the needle-in-a-haystack breakthrough came when Argos victim identification manager Paul Griffiths last year noticed the head administrator habitually used an unusual greeting in online communications.  Scouring the web for other instances of this greeting, Griffiths zeroed in on McCoole, who had been chatting on unrelated, innocuous internet forums. Not only did McCoole use similar language, but the handles he went by were startlingly similar to the one used by the administrator on the abuse site.  As Griffiths looked into McCooleâs background he learned he had access to a wide variety of children through his role at Families SA and alarm bells rang.  With children in danger police immediately coordinated a raid on McCooleâs home in Adelaide. His computer was logged on to the site with his username visible, confirming the arrest of one of the biggest players in child pornography globally.  Taskforce Argos Detective Inspector Jon Rouse said the operation should send a message to pedophiles that they were never beyond reach.  ""The dark net areas are perceived as being safe for the sexual exploitation of children. The work performed by Argos detectives through this operation has proven that is not the case,â Insp Rouse said.  After his arrest, two Argos detectives jointly assumed McCooleâs online identity and their squad began a gruelling operation to bring the site and its users down.  One of their first actions was to shut down the âproducersâ section to protect children from further harm while they hunted their abusers.  Over the next six months, the detectives secretly ran the site from Brisbaneâs police HQ while feeding information to international law enforcement colleagues to take down the networkâs top echelon.  One of the officers who took over McCooleâs identity said the fraught task stretched police to their limits.  âHe doesnât take days off. Heâd been in that community for a very long time, he held a very prominent role in that community, and he was quite well known by a lot of people. It was a lot of work and a lot of stress,â the officer said.  After one key arrest of a co-administrator in the Netherlands, Argos was able to move the computer server hosting the site to Brisbane â giving them full access to every private message and exchange between members.  The operation has now closed and the site has been shut down.  Running a pedophile network is a federal offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail and prosecutors are pushing for a record, benchmark sentence for McCoole.  He has pleaded guilty to 18 charges of unlawful sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault and gross indecency and to the production, dissemination and possession of child exploitation material. Sentencing hearings are ongoing. ""  Ok... The thing of most interest to me was the paragraph: ""Scouring the web for other instances of this greeting, Griffiths zeroed in on McCoole, who had been chatting on unrelated, innocuous internet forums.

The saddest case I can recall was a young man who was on his way home, when his wife or girlfriend texted him to ""Drive safely"".  By automatically reaching for the phone, to see who was calling/texting, he took his eyes off the road, with the result that he lost control of the car, and hit a tree, killing himself.

People need to keep their darknet persona and their real life identity completely separate from one another in every possible way. The use of all forms of social media and alike is, and will continue to be a useful tool that LE will use to draw any comparisons / correlations between potential real life targets and any darknet anonymous persona's exhibiting similar traits. Things such as Stylometry are going to play an important part in linking two or more identities as the same individual or at the very least, give authorities a starting point they previously didn't have.   This creature failed to keep his two lives separate from each other and made the mistake of crossing the line and mixing his two lives together, thus beginning the investigation which ultimately led to his demise.

Everywhere you look today whether you're stopped in a car waiting for pedestrians to cross the road, on a train, walking through a shopping centre or just out for a nightly stroll, you can't help but notice the constant use of phones while being out and about. Some are talking on them, some are writing an sms or an email, some are listening to music or even playing a game while doing other meaningful tasks which require their attention too. People don't even look where they're going anymore. Todays phone is more like a fashion accessory and has become just as important as the wallet or purse we all carry around with us. In todays world, you just can't leave home without it due to our reliance on it for many of our everyday needs. It's basically a mini PC with email and Internet access, a calculator, a world wide temperature gauge, a world clock, a timer, a stopwatch, a gaming console, an e-reader, a portable device capable of playing movies in HD, a digital photo gallery, a modern musical boom box loaded with tunes, a GPS navigation device, an FM / AM radio plus loads of other things should the user ever need them (some apps are already installed on the phone and others can be downloaded from their respective on-line sites if required.)

Since I have not seen the best answer posted above I will give it. The absolute BEST way to use those unsafe plugins like Javascript, Java and Flash is as follows.  You must use 2 separate machines. The first machine has no other way of connecting to the internet other than through the second machine, preferrably running a Whonix gateway. You can also run a Virtual Machine on Machine #1 for an added layer which any exploits or malware would need to break out of first before they can access or execute any type of code on your host operating system.  At this point, even if they are able to ""phone home"" from your host operating system of Machine #1, they are not able to do so outside of the internet connection from Machine #2 running the gateway. Therefore any attempt at phoning home will still have to go through Tor. And as long as you did not do something stupid like use your real name on Machine #1 or leave any identifying information on it, there should be no identifying information to be transmitted.   One of the possible easier solutions for this is called Raspberry Pi which runs as a separate computer gateway through routes all your internet traffic, and now there is a company selling something called an Onion Pi which has been set up specifically to route all your traffic through Tor and the pi is itself a mini computer that acts as a gateway.  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1406  Thank you. $10 please?","I need to anonymously access a website but i need to use it in its fully function state..Can someone please point me in the correct direction.Best i can think of is running tor in a VM and allowing javascript to run in the browser.Please any tech gurus with an alternative method to what i mentioned, Pm me for a $10 reward.(No sitting in a cafe or using public wifi is not a solution its an additional security precaution.)Thanks"

"The Hub Forums","RC4Every0ne","284.0","2014-01-28T23:17:02","Simple method for improving Digital Security.","General Discussion/Security","So on occasion it becomes necessary to store information that we would otherwise wish to dispose of. For example say you have an encrypted PM going with someone and its important you are able to keep track of everything that was said. While keeping everything in one running message with formatting is an option it can become troublesome with longer conversations, and you have to rely on the second party to return your last message before you can account for what you said.  Now this is just one example of some data you might want to store. Obviously all sensitive information needs to be properly disposed of at the first possible moment it still presents a level of risk while it is still needed.  I will describe one way that you can easily improve the resilience of your digital security.  Firstly you need to have a good understanding of PGP and practice practice because it is going to become very important here in a few steps.  This technique relies on obscuration of your files and a strong encryption system.   First step is to get yourself a sufficient Micro SD card. These are inexpensive, hold plenty of data, and are extremely easy to dispose of in a pinch. I recommend a 4gb as they are about the most common anymore, and very inexpensive. You will also need some form of Micro SD reader.   Next is to create a truecrypt volume on your newly acquired MicroSD card. There are plenty of guides on this please become familiar with this software before placing any important information on the card.  Now that you have a place to store your files lets get to obscuring your data. There are many ways to do this, but what you want are a lot of misc files of varying sizes and with lots of extensions. Some indie games are very small 20-40mb and will have literally hundreds of small files in them.   Alternately you can simply go and create folders with randomly selected names, but try and follow some sort of theme as you nest your folders as to further hide their purpose. You want to create 3-5 top level folders at a minimum and each should have 2-6 folders per level nested for 2-3 levels. The deeper you go the harder to find your files will be, but it will also require much more work.  The next step is to place random numbers of files with various extensions and varying file sizes into each of your stealth folders.  Now we are going to create a our first pgp key. Fill this key out with bogus information that you will be able to recognize. Generate the key with a strong password which you can absolutely remember. This one of two passwords which must be both very strong AND easy for you to remember. Write it down for now, but remember you will need to dispose of this hard copy later.  Now we are going to create our first container file. Start by making somefilename.txt as an empty file. Now we are going to wrap this text file into a rar archive. From winrar you are going to jump to the advanced tab and select set password. Select ""encrypt filenames"" and enter a sufficiently strong password. This is the second password you absolutely must remember. At this point we are going to change the file name and extension so that it will blend in with one of our stealth folders. Get creative here.  From here we are going to use the text document within the now hidden rar archive as our first point of storage. This file will be used for storing account names and passwords. This way you can use a unique password for each site and you can use passwords sufficiently complex that they will never be cracked in any useful time frame and you wont have to remember them. Before saving anything in this archive we are going to paste the contents of the file into the PGP application and encrypt the data to the key we made in step #1. Now simply paste the encrypted message into the text file and save it. This will prompt you to update the archive.  Now to further enhance your security you are going to create several more pgp keys, all with unique passwords. The passwords for these may be stored inside of the first archive relatively safely. Use one key for storing messages, and repeat the last step to create a new archive and a new text document. Since this text is encrypted with a unique key it should be considered doubly secure as having any other archives password compromised leave all remaining archives secured. You will repeat this process as many times as you feel necessary until all of your data has been split up and secured.  I suggest also placing one of the other private keys into each encrypted text. This ensures that you have a backup of the public and private keys for each of your files, but they are protected by another PGP key. This should provide you with a safe number of backups should you need to recover one of your keys while never leaving it vulnerable to being publicly viewable.  The idea with this system is to layer your defenses. The disk volume is encrypted, the archive files are password protected with encrypted filenames, each archive contains only PGP encrypted data each of which utilizes a unique key, and all of your accounts may use unique username and passwords, but you only have to remember 2 of them.  Now the biggest weakness to this system is the initial rar file, and the PGP key used for all of your other keys passwords. It is critical that this first pgp key be secured in some way. I recommend that you place these files on a separate MicroSD and put it someplace safe away from all your other business where it will never be looked at twice. This is the only copy of the key required to access all of your other secured files, so if you loose this you are starting back form ground 0.  The goal here is that your archive which contains all of your other passwords should be sufficiently blended in and secured that the odds of LEO #1 finding it, #2 cracking its password, and then using that information to target the remainder of your data is next to zero. Since there are many archives even if they were to discover them all the question then becomes which file do they attack first? If they get any of the other archives you have stopped them in their tracks cold.",""

"The Hub Forums","Fork","7277.0","2015-03-14T11:37:31","SSBD to plead guilty in court today","General Discussion/Legal","I wonder what the plea deal was that he turned down? I have a feeling it may have been to testify against Ross and as well as Mr. Nash seeming like a decent sort of fellow and not the type to agree to that sort of skullduggery his attorney likely very wisely advised his client to keep his name  da fuq outta that mess and away from all the bad press it created.  Saying, ""it was all money for drugs for my own personal use, I was hired for a few months by someone I never even met or knew IRL and I'm really genuinely sorry - I'll take whatever punishment you see fit"" is gonna come across  a lot better with the US Federal courts than screeching that it wasn't him and he was framed as Ross did.  It'll look good and make him look like a gent and a man and not a dirty snitch like Inigo if SSBD writes his memoirs once released as well. You can tell he's British, he has that Howard Marks air of all round good fella about him.   What would this guilty plea from Nash/SSBD do for Ross Ulbricht if he's granted a new trial as his lawyer is requesting at the moment - does anyone know or have any idea? Would it make much difference? Presumably they found Nash's details/ID on Ulbricht's laptop and now he's in court saying, ""Yep it was me"" - would prosecutors mention that if Ross actually  does get granted a new trial. (Spoiler alert: he probably won't).  (Joshua Dratel recently petitioned the NYC courts for a new trial on the grounds that Ulbricht's other trial was unfair or a mistrial or whatever. Fucking hell, I wish the family would fire that guy. I don't think many lawyers would have gone the Dratel route - they'd have gone the Nash lawyer route. Which is be quiet, don't make a fuss, don't cost the American gov the expense and annoyance of a trial, don't do press, don't get your family to do press and just admit it and say you're sorry.    However, Dratel is pretty much obliged to work  some magic because at this point no-one in their right minds who wants to steer clear of long prison sentences would  ever hire him).",""
"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","7277.0","2015-03-14T14:36:01","SSBD to plead guilty in court today","General Discussion/Legal"," I hope so, too. Everything depends on what he was able to negotiate with the prosecutor, and also on the judge. The prosecutor can recommend leniency, but the judge is not required to accept this recommendation. If the judge decides to come down like a ton of bricks on the defendant, there is almost nothing that the defendant can do about it -- they've already pled guilty, and their fate is at the mercy of the judge. It's a complete and total crap-shoot.    I would argue that being paid was  precisely what led him to his current predicament. Let me explain:   American conspiracy law is very broad -- which, in large part, is why conspiracy is one of the prosecution's favorite charges, because it is  so easy to get a conviction on. Many times, in order to convict a person of conspiracy, the statute(s) require that at least one overt act be taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.   I would argue that taking a salary, and essentially becoming an employee of the criminal enterprise suffices to fulfill any overt act requirement. As far as the rest of the charges go, the principles of transfer of liability and/or joint and several liability come into play.   Under conspiracy statutes, every member of the conspiracy is liable for the acts of every other member. For example, let's assume that 3 men conspire to commit a bank robbery. Two of the men enter the bank and hold it up, while the third drives the getaway car. If the robbery went bad, and say, a bank guard is killed, all 3 men were often charged with murder -- even the driver -- who never entered the bank, and didn't fire a shot.   These doctines of transfer of liability and joint and several liability are the rationale behind the moderators being charged with all of the same offenses that DPR himself was charged with.   What leads to no small amount of consternation on my part are the questions:  Why should American law apply?  Why does America assert jurisdiction in so many of these matters?   The Americans are so fucking arrogant that they have actually stated that any 'crime' that involves the Internet automatically places it in their jurisdiction. Their dubious rationale for this stance is that if so much as a single data packet crosses their borders (and a good chunk of the current Internet infrastructure is located in the United States) that this gives them jurisdiction.   The sad fact of the matter is that many of the English-speaking countries appear to be content to let the U.S. get away with this. We've seen the case of Peter Nash (SSBD) in Australia. In the UK there was the case of Richard O'Dwyer, who ran the TVShack.net website. It is noteworthy that, prior to setting up his site, Mr. O'Dwyer consulted a solicitor (lawyer) in the UK and was advised that he was NOT breaking any UK laws by so doing. TVShack hosted no infringing content itself, but merely  linked to where pirated content could be found, just like Google and other search engines.   Despite this, the Americans wanted O'Dwyer -- who broke NO laws in Britain, and who had never even so much as set foot in the United States -- extradited to face trial in the United States for piracy. (Needless to say, this case also originated out of the Southern District of New York, where DPR was tried and convicted, and where Peter Nash (SSBD) is being held, and made his appearance in court on March 13th.)   Personally, I think that this is just the tip of the iceberg; things are going to get much worse in the years to come.   Zaphod   ","I certainly hope his sentence is light. ;As far as I can tell he was only a forum moderator.

What is different about this story is that it reveals, for the first time I've seen, that Nash might not actually be subject to a minimum penalty, due to sentencing guidelines. This is the first piece of good news that I've read in ages. (Relevant part highlighted in red, below.)     ","Silk Road forum moderator pleads guiltyKevin McCoy, USA TODAY 6:13 p.m. EDT March 13, 2015http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/03/13/silk-road-suspect-pleads-guilty/70273074/ (clearnet)NEW YORK â A former aide to convicted Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht pleaded guilty Friday to charges he helped run the sprawling darknet drug-trafficking bazaar.Peter Phillip Nash, 42, admitted he spent 10 months as a forum moderator at Silk Road, an underworld version of eBay that served as an online marketplace for millions of dollars worth of transactions in drugs, fake IDs and electronic hacking tools.Silk Road operated from 2011-2013 and was accessible only via a special electronic browser designed to keep users' identities and activities private. The marketplace required all transactions to be conducted in bitcoins, an anonymous form of electronic currency. Silk Road took a percentage fee on every deal.Dressed in dark jail clothing, Nash, an Australian citizen, told U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa he took the Silk Road post because he could both socialize online and buy drugs for personal use. He never met Silk Road's operator and knew the person only by a pseudonym, he said.Using the online names ""Samesamebutdifferent,"" ""Batman73"" and others, Nash said he was paid between $25,000 and $30,000 in all to watch for scams, answer questions from buyers and sellers and anything related to child pornography or spam.All the money went to ""purchasing drugs for my on consumption,"" he said. ""I deeply regret my conduct and any consequent harm I caused.""Nash faces a mandatory minimum prison term of 10 years and likely deportation from the U.S. for his guilty plea to charges of narcotics trafficking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. However, defense lawyer Andrew Frisch said the minimum punishment would not apply due to a legal safety valve provision in federal sentencing guidelines. Griesa scheduled sentencing for May 26.Nash's guilty plea came weeks after a federal jury in the same lower Manhattan courthouse convicted Ulbricht of narcotics trafficking, conspiracy, participating in a continuing criminal enterprise and other charges for founding and running Silk Road.The panel of six women and six men rejected defense arguments that Ulbricht â who used the nom de Net Dread Pirate Roberts â turned Silk Road over to unidentified others soon after he launched it. The jurors returned the verdict after little more than three hours of deliberation at the conclusion of a more than three-week trial.Ulbricht, 30, faces a mandatory minimum prison term of 20 years and could face life behind bars for the conviction. He's tentatively scheduled to be sentenced May 15 by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who presided over the trial.The convicted mastermind's legal team last week filed a motion seeking a new trial. Ulbricht's lead attorney, Joshua Dratel, argued that prosecutors improperly failed to disclose evidence that could have helped support Ulbricht's claims of innocence in sufficient time for the defense to make full use of the material at trial.Prosecutors are scheduled to file a response to the motion next month.Two other accused Silk Road administrators suspects have been charged in the darknet investigation.Andrew Michael Jones pleaded guilty in October as part of a government cooperation deal. He was initially listed as a government witness for Ulbricht's trial, but prosecutors ultimately did not call him to testify.Gary Davis is in custody in Ireland, awaiting extradition to the U.S. for prosecution, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner.

The 42-year-old was a moderator on the underground internet bazaar Silk Road, a website that distributed large quantities of heroin, cocaine, LSD and methamphetamine. Appearing in the Manhattan District Court, Nash confessed that his involvement as a website moderator was partly so he could obtain drugs for his own consumption. Nashâs guilty plea comes a month after the mastermind of Silk Road, San Francisco-based creator Ross Ulbricht, also known by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, was found guilty of distributing drugs, computer hacking and money laundering.He faces life in jail when sentenced on May 15.Nash says he became aware of Silk Road in 2013 while he was employed as an intellectual disability support worker. âMy motivation was to buy controlled substances for my own use and to socialise,â he said. Nash was extradited from Australia to the US in June last year. He told the court that police swooped on his home on the day he was set to travel to the UK to propose to his fiance. Nash has rejected a prosecution plea deal, which means he is rolling the dice on a potential life sentence.He told the court that while he was aware of the websiteâs role in moving $US200 million of drugs, he was not involved in their distribution and was employed to moderate the chat room âfor scams â¦ and to delete spamâ. He has rejected charges of computer hacking. Nash said that he was paid between $US25,000 to $US30,000 for his 10-month involvement in Silk Road, much of which was spent on drugs for his personal use.He sat in court in his prison uniform looking pale and appearing contrite for his crimes. âI deeply regret my conduct and any offence it might have caused,â he told Judge Thomas Griesa. Nash has been held in Manhattan Correctional Centre since his extradition from Australia where he returned to after his 40-minute appearance in court. He will be sentenced in New York on May 26."

Please refer to this for their original post and read the below response: http://thehubaoydxrommh.onion/index.php?topic=299.msg7015#msg7015   Response to UVC:  How you say things is misleading... by saying UVC doesn't use 'site' wallets makes it sound like your 'site' doesn't use wallets - but in fact, the BTC is still sent to your wallet.   there is a wallet because it's being used as an escrow account; a wallet that you keep and is not on the site itself.   so only you have full access to the BTC, and even if I want my BTC, only you can get it for me manually?  How long does it take?  What if your service was unavailable?  How do I know you won't run off with the BTC?   do you even know what you are talking about?  how could a rogue market operator steal BTC from a multi-sig address?  they would also need the private key of either buyer or seller!  multi-sig address is locked in the Bitcoin blockchain, not by the market operator.   With the stuff listed above, trust is a tough issue here.  You even denied a reproducible XSS vulnerability listed on reddit.com a while back: http://ultracityi2gdwhq.onion/error.php?id=<script>alert=('XXS_TRY_AGAIN')</script>  The worst part is the vulnerability is still there!  I have TorBrowser set to alert me of javascript/XSS attacks and it always pops up 'XSS' detected.  There are potential issues here.  What if I was exploited by someone and they stole my session?  What if someone exploits my browser and gets my IRL IP and dox me/hand me to LE?  I'm not saying you are a scam, but there are others who are listing UVC as one: https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1wj4r1/ultravioletcity_market_no_site_wallets_free/  Could you be more clear on the descriptions?  For god's sake, please also fix the XSS in your error handling page.","Buyers send payments directly to the escrow account for that order, and sellers are paid directly from the escrow account to their external wallet - with a small commission deducted.;As for the escrow accounts, the private keys for these are kept offline and decrypted with two separate keys. Currently, my personal key and the system key.;I'm also skeptical of multi-sig, as a rogue market operator could steal Bitcoins despite the use of multi-sig, if they were determined. At the end of the day, there has to be a level of trust between the user and the admin, otherwise these markets would not work - multi-sig or not, it makes no difference.;I take precautions to prevent any Bitcoins being stolen by external parties; but people using any service will have to decide for themselves whether the administrator is a credible enough mediator for them to place their trust with during Bitcoin transactions."

What exactly it takes to make ""safe"" password the F.A.Q. on cryptsetup site has good info  https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5._Security_Aspects ","First, passphrase length is not really the right measure, passphrase entropy is. For example, a random lowercase letter (a-z) gives you 4.7 bit of entropy, one element of a-z0-9 gives you 5.2 bits of entropy, an element of a-zA-Z0-9 gives you 5.9 bits and a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&:-+ gives you 6.2 bits. On the other hand, a random English word only gives you 0.6...1.3 bits of entropy per character. Using sentences that make sense gives lower entropy, series of random words gives higher entropy. Do not use sentences that can be tied to you or found on your computer. This type of attack is done routinely today.     That said, it does not matter too much what scheme you use, but it does matter how much entropy your passphrase contains, because an attacker has to try on average          1/2 * 2^(bits of entropy in passphrase)        different passphrases to guess correctly.     Historically, estimations tended to use computing time estimates, but more modern approaches try to estimate cost of guessing a passphrase.     As an example, I will try to get an estimate from the numbers in http://it.slashdot.org/story/12/12/05/0623215/new-25-gpu-monster-devours-strong-passwords-in-minutes More references can be found a the end of this document. Note that these are estimates from the defender side, so assuming something is easier than it actually is is fine. An attacker may still have vastly higher cost than estimated here.     LUKS uses SHA1 for hashing per default. The claim in the reference is 63 billion tries/second for SHA1. We will leave aside the check whether a try actually decrypts a key-slot. Now, the machine has 25 GPUs, which I will estimate at an overall lifetime cost of USD/EUR 1000 each, and an useful lifetime of 2 years. (This is on the low side.) Disregarding downtime, the machine can then break         N = 63*10^9 * 3600 * 24 * 365 * 2 ~ 4*10^18         passphrases for EUR/USD 25k. That is one 62 bit passphrase hashed once with SHA1 for EUR/USD 25k. Note that as this can be parallelized, it can be done faster than 2 years with several of these machines.     For plain dm-crypt (no hash iteration) this is it.

That is up to your own security evaluation. For general use, I will assume the attacker is willing to spend up to 1 million EUR/USD. Then we get the following recommendations:     Plain dm-crypt: Use > 80 bit. That is e.g. 17 random chars from a-z or a random English sentence of > 135 characters length.     LUKS: Use > 65 bit. That is e.g. 14 random chars from a-z or a random English sentence of > 108 characters length.     If paranoid, add at least 20 bit. That is roughly four additional characters for random passphrases and roughly 32 characters for a random English sentence."

Their reasoning was that for every encrypted archive they lost access to because of power loss, there were a hundred cases where someone would attempt to delete it if it remained powered on.

In October 2013, I was hired by Dread Pirate Roberts a/k/a Blake Benthall as lead programmer for Silk Road 2.0. From November 2013 up until the FBI seizure in late 2014, I oversaw the website from behind the curtains and managed the bulk of its servers. I was paid over 1,200 BTC for my service.  I have been sitting on a large database backup containing the usernames and hashed passwords of 476,122 users, 51,490 deposit addresses, 7,756 plaintext passwords, 13,280 product listings, 52,481 private messages, 145,493 transaction records and the entire Silk Road source code.  If you have not heard of DarkLeaks before please read:   https://medium.com/@ZozanCudi/darkleaks-information-blackmarket-1ee5ac28c892  Basically it is a crypto method for anonymously selling information for Bitcoins.  Today I will start with the user table dump containing 476,122 user account details. The dump is a 44MB text file. No passwords, only hashes.   https://mega.co.nz/#!kApCwa5T!Oj61cXAXBkBzXJAiF_EIcapP_IRlkJPhll9XarexJQw  If the above link does not work, try:  http://32lyyt7w2hvzlpvu.onion/download/6dc7a1421cf93bbbef0d9c6d6e6149e4  At block height 343278 I will prove possession of the encrypted files by releasing 10 of the 100 chunks. These chunks will be selected at complete random, provable by the blockchain so that you can be sure it is authentic.  I will then begin to sell the remaining after people confirm its legitimacy. If this user table is sold off successfully I will offer the rest of the tables including the 7,756 passwords stored in plaintext. If anyone would like to purchase the source code, please notify me of your interest.

We felt the ordering of the (original) list was correct although didn't have any vendors who registered after Feb 2014. What we were trying to say is that the orderingn of the (original) list is largelyderived by somebody who scraped the site in November when vendor urls contained the UID. He has added maybe 15 extra vendor accounts to this list.  And the dump on githib, again completely unverifiable. Now if it were possible to verifiy ones password then maybe. If there were accounts listed that could only be had by someone with the database then maybe.  But no, we are told the SHA1 derived password contains salt and other data that therefore we cannot verify.  On top of that we had dozens of buyer accounts used for scraping regsitered throughout the period, none are listed  Even without those technical details, this stinks of scam, it has it written all over it.

They, of all people, should have known better. ZaphodNewbie vendors do exist... I agree with you though, if lack of research is excusable in a buyer it's much more worrying coming from a vendor who should have a professional approach to this, since their freedom is on the line more than anyone else's.I'm still amazed at the number of vendors accepting privnote messages, I even saw one who accepts payment through bank transfers on a Polish bank account.

So, yeah some vendors will get in trouble because of that leak, I feel sorry for them on one hand, on the other I feel the markets will only come out of this safer because rid of untrustworthy, unreliable, uncaring vendors.absolutely. vendors should be all over their own opsec not only because of the risks they face themselves but because they're trusted with personal buyer information. i also recall a few vendors claiming site admins had emptied their wallets, turns out they just registered on a new untrusted market or simply got phished haha. i mean the hidden wiki.. shit i don't properly memorise url's but i can spot a red flag in a dodgy link made to look similar. buyers can get a bit excited and carried away wanting their first order, it's understandable but reckless, still at least they're only putting themselves at risk. vendors should be researching for months before diving in imo. it all seems to be going backwards in recent times, even the progress made by astor and st exo with getting vendors using strong keys and stop using programs that require js.. i think that is the biggest downside of how segregated the community has become. we used to have a wealth of really good info and trusted members who actually had serious knowledge and patience to help, all in one place, fighting for the same thing. it took a bit of determination to get set up before there was all the youtube videos and newbie guides on clearnet ushering clueless people over in droves. the intellect has been diluted essentially "

As for new members, maybe just because the server can't hold the influx. Which may relate to current problems.  I agree it is them and EVO battling it out and evo has a perfect opportunity to get most traffic at the moment and become the Number 1. If that's not already happened.  Its interesting because we have seen some heavyweight battles between the top markets over the time.  SR Vs BMR & SR2 VS Sheep both won by SR due to the success, marketable nature of SR's name and media coverage. All admittedly sheep did get hacked/ did a runner.  SR2 VS Agora Vs EVO- Even with all of SR2'S problems they were still matching Agora although near the end Agora was clearly taking the lead with EVO silently becoming a main contender.  Now we have Agora Vs Evo. 2 very well run sites and although Agora has had downtime both sites have run remarkably well with no real issues, hacks, scams e.t.c. I don't think i have ever seen EVO down.  Who will come up trumps. I don't know. Evo's perfect record and Agora downtime may give them the edge at the moment but personally i am always glad to see at least to high traffic markets. Competition is healthy.  Sorry to change the subject and go on a bit but sometimes i think the history and all the constant drama on the dark web gets me more excited than the fact i get drugs delivered to my door thanks to the beautiful Royal Mail.","Quote from: Guyver on November 25, 2014, 11:11:23 pmI don't know the ins and outs but i have read before it was to reveal some exploits in the code or whatever so he can then take advantage.

I was thinking the mass listings are a precursor and the exploit is applied through means of another function. The listings would be added over time, most likely by a script operating within the time limit, and finally exploited after thousands of listings have been created. I'm not familiar with the functions available on vendor accounts, but perhaps there's some code that, for example, doesn't limit rows and hangs enough for an injection when interating through every listing from a sole vendor.  Lots of different variables to say anything practical, but that's my first thought.","Quote from: nugget on November 27, 2014, 07:56:33 pmSounds like a buffer overflow attack.

Clearnet: http://www.blogsofwar.com/2013/11/11/interview-hacker-opsec-with-the-grugq/  Hacker OPSEC with The Grugq Why Your Faith in Technology is Terribly Misplaced  The Grugq is an world renowned information security researcher with 15 years of industry experience. Grugq started his career at a Fortune 100 company, before transitioning to @stake, where he was forced to resign for publishing a Phrack article on anti-forensics. Since then the Grugq has presented on anti-forensics at dozens of international security conferences, as well as talks on numerous other security topics. As an independent information security consultant the Grugq has performed engagements for a wide range of customers, from startups to enterprises and the public sector. He has worked as a professional penetration tester, a developer, and a full time security researcher. The GrugqÃ¢â¬â¢s research has always been heavily biased towards counterintelligence aspects of information security. His research has been referenced in books, papers, magazines, and newspapers. Currently an independent researcher, the grugq is actively engaged in exploring the intersection of traditional tradecraft and the hacker skillset, learning the techniques that covert organisations use to operate clandestinely and applying them to the Internet. You can follow him on Twitter at @thegrugq.  John Little: You blog and have given conference presentations on Hacker OPSEC. You started doing this before the recent NSA revelations (and the general hysteria surrounding intelligence collection) but you were already warning hackers that states had superseded them as the internetÃ¢â¬â¢s apex predator. In just a couple of years weÃ¢â¬â¢ve moved from the seeming invincibility of LulzSec, to high profile busts, and now onto serious concerns being raised about the every aspect of the internetÃ¢â¬â¢s architecture, security models, and tools. Rock solid OPSEC is a refuge but maintaining it for long periods of time under significant pressure is very difficult. The deck is obviously stacked against anyone trying to evade state surveillance or prosecution so where do freedom fighters and those with less noble intentions go from here?  The Grugq: You raise a number of interesting points. IÃ¢â¬â¢ll ramble on about them in a moment, but before that IÃ¢â¬â¢d like to clarify for your readers a bit about where I am coming from. Firstly, I am not a Ã¢â¬Åprivacy advocateÃ¢â¬Â, I am an information security researcher. My career in information security has been mostly focused around denial and deception at the technical level.  Recently, however, I became aware that this Ã¢â¬Åfetishizing the technologyÃ¢â¬Â approach is simply not effective in the real world. So I turned to studying clandestine skills used in espionage and by illicit groups, such as narcotics cartels and terrorist groups. The tradecraft of these clandestine organizations is what I am trying to extract, inject with hacker growth hormone, and then teach to those who need real security: journalists; executives traveling to adversarial environments; silly kids making stupid life altering mistakes, etc.  The media has actually expressed a lot of interesting in improving their security posture, and I am engaged in helping some journalists develop good OPSEC habits. Or at least, learn what those habits would be, so they have some idea of what to aspire to. There is a strange intransigence with some who reject improved security with the line: Ã¢â¬Åbut weÃ¢â¬â¢re not criminals! Why do we need this?Ã¢â¬Â Well, the only answer I have is that OPSEC is prophylactic, you might not need it now, but when you do, you canÃ¢â¬â¢t activate it retroactively. As I phrased it in my Ã¢â¬ÅThe Ten Hack CommandmentsÃ¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬â be proactively paranoid, it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t work retroactively.  So, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s how IÃ¢â¬â¢ve arrived at hacker tradecraft, and where IÃ¢â¬â¢m trying to take it. On to the issues youÃ¢â¬â¢ve raised about good OPSEC and living a clandestine life.  The stress of the clandestine lifestyle is something that people tend to gloss over all too easily. This is an observation that comes up frequently in the literature about terrorist groups, espionage agents, and revolutionaries. There are a lot of compound issues which combine to make this sort of Ã¢â¬Ågood OPSECÃ¢â¬Â lifestyle very unhealthy for the human mind:     1. Isolation    2. Compartmentation of the ego    3. Paranoia related stress  Isolation provides the strongest security, and all good security involves a significant investment in maintaining a low profile, Ã¢â¬Ågoing undergroundÃ¢â¬Â, Ã¢â¬Åoff the gridÃ¢â¬Â, etc. This means that the clandestine operative has reduced visibility over the social and political landscape, and their telemetry will suffer. Degraded telemetry means they will be unable to self-correct and reorient to what is happening around them. If they are part of a cell, a group of operatives in communal isolation, they will tend to self reinforce their ideology. Effectively radicalizing and distancing themselves further from the mainstream norms of society. This additional isolation can create a feedback loop.  If the operative isnÃ¢â¬â¢t living a completely isolated clandestine lifestyle in their Unabomber cabin, they will have to isolate parts of their individual selves to compartment the different aspects of their lives. There will be their normal public life, the one face they show to the world, and also a sharded ego with their clandestine life. Maintaining strict compartmentation of the mind is stressful, the sharded individual will be a sum less than the total of the parts.  As if that wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t enough, there is the constant fear of discovery, that the clandestine cover will be stripped away by the adversary. This leaves the operative constantly fretting about the small details of each clandestine operational activity. Coupled with the compartmentalization of the self, the operative also has to stress about each non-operational activity, will this seemingly innocent action be the trigger that brings it all crashing down?  Seriously, maintaining a strong security posture for prolonged periods of time is an extremely stressful and difficult act. Operatives working for the intelligence agencies have a significantly easier time of it than those on the other side of the protection of the state: e.g. their agents; hackers; terrorists, and narcos. The Ã¢â¬ÅlegalÃ¢â¬Â operatives have peers that they can confide in and unwind with thanks to the protections of the nation state. The true clandestine agents must be guarded with their peers, the public and the adversary. Any peer might be an informant, either now or in the future. Opening up and being friendly with their peers is part of what lead to the unraveling of the lulzsec hacker group.  This leaves people who need to operate clandestinely and use the internet with a real problem. How can you be on the Internet and isolated? Well, compartmentation is the only answer, but it is expensive and fragile, even a single error or mistake can destroy the whole thing. This is why IÃ¢â¬â¢ve advocated that people who seek to operate clandestinely combine deception, that is, multiple covers, for their compartmented activities. It is possible to embed tripwires into the cover identities and be alerted when theyÃ¢â¬â¢re blown.  My thinking these days is that an operative must minimize the time that they are engaged in a clandestine operation. Something like the theory of special operations, the period of vulnerability only grows the longer the operation goes on. Clandestine operational activity must be compartmented, it must be planned, it must be short in duration, and it must be rehearsed (or at least, composed of habitual actions). It is possible to do, and I believe that even non-experts can pull it off, but it must be limited in scope and duration. Prolonged exposure to underground living is caustic to the soul.  John Little: There is a significant amount of paranoia circulating in hacker and activist communities right now. How much of it is justified? More importantly, how should people go about conducting a realistic personal risk assessment before they start piling on layer after layer of OPSEC? How can they strike that balance between the tedium and isolation and security that is Ã¢â¬Ågood enoughÃ¢â¬Â?  The Grugq: There is certainly a great deal of paranoia, some of it justified, some of it unjustified, and some of it misdirected. I think it is important to remember that paranoia is unhealthy, it is paralyzing, it is divisive, and it is harmful to operational effectiveness. The goal to aim for is caution. Allowing the adversary to inflict paranoia on you, or your group, gives them an easy psychological operation Ã¢â¬ÅwinÃ¢â¬Â. So lets drop the paranoia and figure out what security precautions we must take in order to operate safely and effectively.  As you bring up, the core to effective security is performing a risk assessment, deciding what information is most important to protect, and then developing mitigation strategies to safe guard that information. There are books and manuals that go into this in great depth, so I wonÃ¢â¬â¢t spend a lot of time on the details.  A risk assessment should focus on the most high impact items first. To determine this, you list your adversaries and group them by intent and capability. So the NSA would have a very high capability, but probably has a low intent of targeting you. Then you make a list of information about your secrets, what you are trying to protect, and group that based on the negative impact it would have if it were in the hands of an opponent. The most damaging information must be protected from the likely and the most capable adversaries.  Generally speaking, if youÃ¢â¬â¢re engaged in a clandestine activity that you want to protect, the core information to secure is:     1. Your identity    2. Your clandestine activity    3. Your association with the activity  So lets take the example of the Dread Pirate Roberts, whoÃ¢â¬â¢s been in the news recently after he got arrested. His adversaries were highly capable, including a wide range of law enforcement officials from across the globe. They were highly motivated, because DPR and his site were very high profile. So you have high capability, and high intent. Not looking good so far.  The information that was most important was his personal real world identity, followed by his location. Protecting that information would require:     1. Robust compartmentation    2. Reducing his exposure to the most capable adversaries (e.g. leave the USA)    3. A strong disinformation campaign    4. Limiting his time in Ã¢â¬Åthe dragonworldÃ¢â¬Â (to use J. BellsÃ¢â¬â¢ term for the underground)  For most people engaged in a clandestine activity this list is probably what they will want to follow. The exact mitigation enacted for each component in the list is case dependent. As we discussed earlier, and as youÃ¢â¬â¢ve said, we need to find a good balance between an aggressive security posture and living a rewarding life.  Remember, the goal is to reduce the quantity and the quality of information available to the adversary.  John Little: So a point which both of us comment on with some regularity is the fact that security is rooted in behavior rather than technology. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s always been true to some extent but never more than now. Tools are suspect, almost across the board. And a lot of assumptions about security have to be tossed aside. But one thing is certain, hackers adapt to the adversary. Terrorists do this well too. An attacker who can successfully parse all this and adapt is going to be a very significant threat. How can states counter the advanced threats? How can they counter hackers who know how to manage OPSEC and technical security to evade detection?  The Grugq: HUMINT. More of it.  The role of SIGINT in intelligence has basically been this weird bubble, starting around WWII when the love of SIGINT started until recently, when some of the SIGINT capabilities are starting to go dark. SIGINT is much more attractive than HUMINT. Signals donÃ¢â¬â¢t lie. They donÃ¢â¬â¢t forget. They donÃ¢â¬â¢t show up late to meetings, or provided intelligence information that is deliberately deceptive. SIGINT is the heroin of intelligence collection. The whole world got hooked on it when they discovered it, and it has had a very good runÃ¢â¬Â¦ it will probably continue to be useful for decades more, but reallyÃ¢â¬Â¦ the real utility of SIGINT will start to diminish now. It has to. The amount of encryption being deployed means that many mass collection capabilities will start to go dark. I, of course, am in total favour of this. I think that the privacy and protection of the entire Internet are more important than the ability of the US government to model the Ã¢â¬ÅchatterÃ¢â¬Â between everyone using the Internet. The reduced security that the US government has tried (and succeeded) to force on the entire world is makes all of us less safe against any adversary.",""

"The Hub Forums","Baraka","6005.0","2014-12-08T23:33:46","Article: Hacker OPSEC with The Grugq","General Discussion/Security","CONTINUED  SIGINT is really the sort of intelligence collection technique that needs to lose its prominence in the pantheon of intelligence gods. It is very easy for a serious adversary to defeat: basic tradecraft from the days of Allen Dulles will work (leave the phone behind, have the meeting while taking a walk). This tradecraft technique is described by Dulles, in 50 year old KGB manuals, and by Hizbollah operatives last year. The only way to catch people who are capable of any sort of OPSEC / tradecraft is via: a) Mistakes that they make (very easy for amateurs to make mistakes), or b) Via HUMINT. Spies catch spies, as the saying goes. It might be updated to, spies catch clandestine operatives.  Historically, the value of HUMINT has been very hit and miss, but those Ã¢â¬ÅhitsÃ¢â¬Â are extremely valuable. The major successes of the Cold War were almost all the result of human beings who became spies for the opposition: Ames, Hanssen, Walker, Howard, Tolkachev, etc. There are myriad cases with terrorist groups as well, informants is the best weapon against them. Relying on SIGINT is essentially relying on the adversary (terrorist groups) having poor tradecraft and terrible counterintelligence practices. This is simply not the case, at least not with sophisticated dangerous groups.  Double down on HUMINT and scale back SIGINT. SIGINT can be evaded, but HUMINT, essentially exploiting trust relationships, will always bite you in the ass.  John Little: Hackers are going to have to evolve in the same direction though arenÃ¢â¬â¢t they? Technology isnÃ¢â¬â¢t their salvation from an OPSEC perspective, in fact it is really the weakest link in their security model, so they will have to fully embrace good old-fashioned tradecraft and deception to avoid detection. Do you see an appreciation of that in the hacking community? It seems like a lot of big name hackers are still making fairly simple OPSEC mistakes.  The Grugq: Exactly, this is really the understanding that needs to sink in: technology alone will not save you. Hacker culture, almost by definition, is technology obsessed. We fetishize technology and gadgets, and this leads us to the deep-seated belief that if we just use the right tool, our problems will be solved. This mindset is fundamentally wrong. At best, I would call it misguided, but really I believe that most of the time it is actually counter productive.  Trust is the weakest link in the security chain, it is what will get you in the most trouble. This goes double for trusting in technology (even, as Bruce Schneier says Ã¢â¬Åtrust the mathÃ¢â¬Â). Tech is not the path to security. Security comes from the way that you live your life, not the tools. The tools are simply enablers. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re utilities. OPSEC is a practice.  Expecting the tools to provide security for you is like buying a set of weights and then sitting around waiting for your fitness to improve. The fallacy that technology will provide the solution has to be seen for what it is, a false promise. There is nothing that will protect secrets better than not telling them to people!  Good OPSEC is founded on the same basic principles that have governed clandestine activities since the dawn of time. Hackers might be new, but good hackers require the same set of skills as the second oldest profession. Good OPSEC is timeless, and it stems from the application of the principles of clandestine operation, using caution and common sense.  The Ã¢â¬Å73 rules of spycraftÃ¢â¬Â by Allen Dulles was written before the Internet, before hacker culture (even phreaker culture) existed. I believe it is one of the most valuable guides available to understanding how to implement OPSEC. (As an interesting aside, harking back to one of my previous points, Dulles recommends taking vacations to get away from the stress of Ã¢â¬ÅworkÃ¢â¬Â.)  There are a lot of very public hackers who exhibit terrible security practices. Many of them are techno fetishists rather than espionage geeks, consequently they fail to understand how limited their knowledge is. Its the DunningÃ¢â¬âKruger effect in full tilt. They donÃ¢â¬â¢t do the research on their opposition and donÃ¢â¬â¢t know what sort of techniques will be used against them. By the time they figure it out, they are usually just an opportunity for the rest of us to practice Lessons Learned analysis. Of course the great tragedy is that many of the hacker community suffer from hubris that prevents them from actually learning from otherÃ¢â¬â¢s failures.  A friend of mine paraphrase Brian Snow (formerly of the NSA) Ã¢â¬Åour security comes not from our expertise, but from the sufferance of our oppositionÃ¢â¬Â. As soon as the adversary is aware of the existence of secrets worth discovering, and has the resources available to pursue them, hackers rapidly learn how good their OPSEC is.  John Little: IÃ¢â¬â¢ve always been amazed at the very public profiles of some hackers, especially where conferences are concerned. Granted, most are legitimate security researchers but there are also many in the community who occupy a grey area that is guaranteed to draw attention from intelligence or law enforcement agencies. Are hackers largely underestimating the skill with which intelligence agencies can penetrate, encircle, and absorb aspects of their community? Are we in for significant changes in the relationship between IC/LE and hackers, how hackers view themselves from a security standpoint, and how hackers engage each other?  The Grugq: Yes, very much so. There is a growing awareness of the altered threat landscape, and the need for an improved security posture. For decades the hacker community has been myopically focused on SIGINT threats, the sorts of technical attacks that have technical solutions. The HUMINT threat has been misunderstood, or ignored completely. That is changing as the hacker community is starting to learn and practice counterintelligence.  It is a difficult transition though, as some core counterintelligence principles run directly counter to the hacker ethos. There are a lot of factors at play, but one of the important ones is that hacker culture is very much a research culture. There is a great deal of knowledge exchange that goes on rather freely within various segments of the community. The problem, of course, is that the trading of information, which is so central to hacker culture, is the antithesis of a strong security posture. Many hackers realize this, so they only share with trusted friends, who then only share with their trusted friends, who thenÃ¢â¬Â¦ and then suddenly everyone is on lists and someone is going to jail.  Security conferences are important events for hackers where they disseminate their research and findings, and socialize. This makes these events very target rich environments for intelligence agencies looking to build dossiers on hackers. They can see who is socializing with whom, attempt to recruit people, elicit information on capabilities, install malware on computers, collect intel from computers, and so on. That hackers would expose themselves to these activities seems very counterproductive for robust security. What gives?  The hacker community has a slightly different set of moral and ethical guidelines than mainstream society, which leads to problems with the authorities. Broadly speaking, few hackers view breaking into a system as unethical or morally wrong. Damaging the system, stealing information, or otherwise abusing the system is wrong. Simply accessing it is a challenge. The police, of course, view things differently: an illegal act is an illegal act.  For hackers the secret knowledge that they discover from active research is something to be proud of, and so weÃ¢â¬â¢re very excited to brag about our findings, activities or capabilities. This information is treated as something that will be kept within the community, bound by the FrieNDA. Of course, this is all based on trust, which is a very dangerous foundation for any security system. As DullesÃ¢â¬â¢ says, the second greatest vice is vanity, the third is drink. Security conferences are not the places to avoid those vices!  So there is certainly this dynamic of wanting to brag about our discoveries from active research, but at the same time the tension of Ã¢â¬Åwhat will happen if this leaks?Ã¢â¬Â. These days we know what will happen, over zealous law enforcement and prosecution: weev, Aaron Schwartz, Stephen Watt, Dan Cuthbert, etc. The authorities view hackers as modern day witches, something to be feared and destroyed. It is unfortunate for the hacker community in many ways. Intelligent people who could contribute to mainstream society have their lives destroyed. So the repercussions of what are generally harmless activities can be devastating and life altering. Unfortunately, the protections that hackers turn to tend to be technological, but the problem is humans.  The hacker community is easy prey for law enforcement and the intelligence community. Very few hackers are savvy enough to spot a recruitment pitch, or to understand that what they think is amusing others view as criminal. I think this is starting to change. These days there is a lot less discussion about illegal hacking of systems (whether for monetary gain or not), and more about how to protect against the massive Internet surveillance that has been made public.  In this, I think, the hacker community and the general public are finding a lot of common cause against the LE/IC. There is a lot of good that will come out of this realization that the technology of privacy is actually important and should be ubiquitous, and easy to use. The default should be secure. Of course, as we know, this wonÃ¢â¬â¢t help that much if someone is going around making basic OPSEC errors. So strong privacy protections for everyone will make the job of the LE/IC a bit harder, but it will also make everyone safer. I think that is a fair trade off.  Similarly, I think a lot of hackers would be quite happy to help the LE/IC community with technology support and ideas. The problem is that the relationship is a difficult one to establish. The IC is a black-hole, sucking in information and returning nothing. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know how there can be meaningful engagement between the two communities, which I believe is a tremendous shame. There is a lot that can be learned from both sides, and I would love for the IC to contribute back. Law enforcement doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t interest me that much. Personally, my interest with LE begins and ends with studying their tools techniques and procedures for counterintelligence purposes. Something, that historically at least, few other hackers actually do. That is changing.  Hackers are learning to tighten up their security posture, they are learning about the tools techniques and procedures that get used against them, and they are learning how to protect themselves. Of course, the preponderance of criminal activity is committed in places where lax enforcement of computer crime laws allows blackhats to operate inside Ã¢â¬Åprotected territoryÃ¢â¬Â. In the long term, this is an extremely dangerous situation for those guys, of course, because without an adversarial environment they wonÃ¢â¬â¢t learn how to operate securely. When the rules change, they will be caught out, completely unprepared.  The intelligence agencies and law enforcement departments have decades of organizational history and knowledge. The individual members can display wide ranges of skill and competence, but the resources and core knowledge of the organization dwarf what any individual hacker has available. Many of the skills that a hacker needs to learn, his clandestine tradecraft and OPSEC, are the sort of skills that organizations are excellent at developing and disseminating. These are not very good skill-sets for an individual to learn through trial and error, because those errors have significant negative consequences. An organization can afford to lose people as it learns how to deal with the adversary; but individual cannot afford to make a similar sacrifice Ã¢â¬â after all, who would benefit from your negative example?  The skills that hackers do have, the highly technical capabilities they can bring to the game, are not useful against an adversary whoÃ¢â¬â¢s primary skill is manipulating other people. Knowing how to configure a firewall, use Tor, encrypt everything, etc. isnÃ¢â¬â¢t going to do much good if you also attend a conference without a highly tuned functioning spook-dar and a working knowledge of anti-elicitation techniques. The hackers are hopelessly outclassed at this game. Hell, the majority of them donÃ¢â¬â¢t even know that theyÃ¢â¬â¢re playing!  Times are changing though, and hackers are starting to learn: OPSEC will get you through times of no crypto better than crypto will get you through times of no OPSEC.

At the risk of over-using a nautical analogy, I've been warning that a storm is coming, and to batten-down the hatches. The storm is now virtually upon us.   Edit: Added some information about GCHQ's formation of a dedicated squad to fight 'child abuse' -- mark my words... within 12-24 months, they'll expand their remit to drug-related crimes as well.   Zaphod  Example #1:    I believe that there is virtually no chance that Obama is going to veto this legislation; even if he did, the new Congressional session starting in January, with a Republican majority, would likely vote to over-ride any Obama veto.    Example 2:     I've seen interviews with Canadian Constitutional lawyers who say  they cannot understand what it means -- if Constitutional lawyers can't figure out what the ruling means, how is a police officer going to?  One lawyer for the BC Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) put it this way, when referring to the rule that an officer can go through 'recent' texts or emails: A recent email might mean 1-2 days back for one officer; another officer might think that recent means 1-2 months.   I'm not involved in anything illegal, and I simply refuse to carry a phone -- to me, this ruling just confirms the wisdom of my long-held belief.   Example 3:     And so it begins.... First they start with the paedophiles, because they are a group that literally NO ONE supports, so the backlash is bound to be minimal. Anyone who objects to this can be tarred with the epithets 'paedophile' or 'paedophile supporter' or 'paedophile sympathiser'.

"," Home | Policy | TechnologyGOP rep attempted late bid to kill spy bill By Julian Hattem - 12/11/14 09:02 AM ESTOne of the biggest thorns in the side of the countryÃ¢â¬â¢s intelligence agencies attempted to mount an eleventh hour bid to kill the spy agencies' funding bill on Wednesday.Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) wrote on Facebook that the intelligence authorization bill that easily passed through the House contained Ã¢â¬Åone of the most egregious sections of law I've encountered during my time as a representative.Ã¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬ÅIt grants the executive branch virtually unlimited access to the communications of every American,Ã¢â¬Â explained Amash, who has a record of skepticism toward the National Security Agency and other agencies. Last year, he nearly succeeded in an attempt to end the NSAÃ¢â¬â¢s controversial phone records program.The bill was originally set to be considered with just a simple voice vote, but Amash rushed to the House floor on Wednesday to demand a recorded vote. He also fired off a letter to his fellow lawmakers warning them not to back the bill.Hidden in the law is Ã¢â¬Åa troubling new provision that for the first time statutorily authorizes spying on U.S. citizens without legal process,Ã¢â¬Â Amash told other lawmakers.That provision allows Ã¢â¬Åthe acquisition, retention, and disseminationÃ¢â¬Â of AmericansÃ¢â¬â¢ communications without a court order or subpoena.That type of collection is currently allowed under an executive order that dates back to former President Reagan, but the new stamp of approval from Congress was troubling, Amash said. Limits on the governmentÃ¢â¬â¢s ability to retain information in the provision did not satisfy the Michigan Republican.Despite AmashÃ¢â¬â¢s late attempt, the bill easily passed, 325-100.The bill passed the Senate earlier this week and is now on its way to President Obama. http://thehill.com/policy/technology/226752-gop-rep-attempted-late-bid-to-kill-spy-bill ; Canada court: Police can search a suspect's phoneThe Associated Press12/11/2014 3:14 PM OTTAWA, OntarioCanadian police can conduct a limited search of criminal suspects' mobile phones when they are arrested without getting a search warrant, but they must follow strict rules, a divided Supreme Court of Canada ruled Thursday.In a 4-3 decision, Canada's top court said the search must be directly related to the circumstances of a person's arrest and police must keep detailed records of the search. It is the first time the Supreme Court has ruled on mobile phone privacy, an issue that has spawned a series of divergent lower court rulings.The high court dismissed the appeal of a 2009 armed robbery conviction of Kevin Fearon, who argued unsuccessfully that police violated his rights when they searched his phone without a warrant after he'd robbed a Toronto jewelry kiosk.The court agreed that the police had breached Fearon's rights, but the evidence against him on his phone should not be excluded.""The police simply did something that they believed on reasonable grounds to be lawful and were proven wrong, after the fact, by developments in the jurisprudence,"" Justice Thomas Cromwell wrote for the majority.Cromwell said the court was trying to strike a balance between the demands of effective law enforcement and the public's right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Three dissenting justices said police should need a search warrant in almost all cases.Canada's decision directly contrasts a unanimous ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June, which determined that mobile phones generally cannot be searched by police without a warrant during arrests.http://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/article4422973.html ;The Supreme Court majority cited the importance of prompt police investigations. Cellphones Ã¢â¬Åare the Ã¢â¬Ëbread and butterÃ¢â¬â¢ of the drug trade and the means by which drugs are marketed on the street,Ã¢â¬Â  Justice Thomas Cromwell wrote for the majority, citing a previous ruling. He was joined by Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and Justices Richard Wagner and Michael Moldaver.Ã¢â¬ÅPrompt access by law enforcement to the contents of a cellphone may serve the purpose of identifying accomplices or locating and preserving evidence that might otherwise be lost or destroyed. Cellphones may also be used to evade or resist law enforcement. An individual may be a 'scout' for drug smugglers, using a cellphone to warn criminals that police are in the vicinity or to call for 'back up' to help resist law enforcement officers. In such situations, a review of recent calls or text messages may help to locate the other perpetrators before they can either escape or dispose of the drugs and reveal the need to warn officers of possible impending danger."" The majority said that the search must be tailored to its purpose, which will generally mean that only recent e-mails, texts, photos and the call log will be available.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/police-dont-need-warrants-to-search-cellphones-top-court-rules/article22038283/ ;Life > Gadgets and Tech > NewsDark net: what is it, and what are the dangers of the GovernmentÃ¢â¬â¢s secret browsing crackdown?The Government unveiled new plans to track down paedophiles who use the Ã¢â¬Ëdark netÃ¢â¬â¢ to share images of sexual abuse this morning. But the move might endanger the anonymous technologies themselves Ã¢â¬â which is also helping keep real and potential victims of crime safe.The dark net is far more than just a place to allow for child sexual abuse Ã¢â¬â itÃ¢â¬â¢s a whole network of anonymised internet browsers and sites that allow people to access them without being tracked by governments or other groups. Far from being a tool for criminals, its advocates argue, it can actually keep people from becoming the victims of crime.Activists have expressed worry that high-profile cases of abuse of the anonymous software might be used to demonise the technology more generally. A similar criticism was made after a report into the death of Lee Rigby seemed to suggest that US tech companies should open themselves up to UK Government spying more openly.What is the dark net?The dark net is a subsection of the deep web Ã¢â¬â the part of the internet that doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t show up on search engines or on social media. Most people will never actually go on it Ã¢â¬â about 20,000 people use it each day in the UK, up by two-thirds Ã¢â¬â but itÃ¢â¬â¢s thought to be about 500 times as big as the Ã¢â¬Ësurface webÃ¢â¬â¢.The dark net is a part of that deep web. It is accessed through Tor.WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s Tor?ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a web browser, like Chrome or Safari, but built to be as anonymous as possible. It sends internet data through a series of Ã¢â¬ËrelaysÃ¢â¬â¢, adding extra encryption, making web traffic practically impossible to trace.Among other things, itÃ¢â¬â¢s been used to get around internet censorship in countries that take certain websites offline, a key area of interest for the project that made it.While the GovernmentÃ¢â¬â¢s statement this morning didnÃ¢â¬â¢t mention any technologies by name, it did say that one recent investigation targeted a person who was Ã¢â¬Åusing software which enables online anonymityÃ¢â¬Â, which sounds like a reference to Tor.Why would people use the dark net?The dark net came to greater prominence with the raids on Silk Road Ã¢â¬â an online marketplace mostly used for selling drugs. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s not a bad example of what itÃ¢â¬â¢s used for: the drugs trade, illegal sexual content, and fraud and money laundering.But itÃ¢â¬â¢s also favoured by anonymity activists and privacy campaigners. Even the FBI, when writing up their report on the Silk Road arrests, acknowledged that it can be used for good, writing that Ã¢â¬ÅTor has known legitimate usesÃ¢â¬Â.Parker Higgins, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote in the wake of the Silk Road raids that: Ã¢â¬ÅIt's essential that the use of encryption, anonymization techniques, and other privacy practices is not deemed a suspicious activity. Rather, it must be recognized as an essential element for practicing freedom of speech in a digital environment.Ã¢â¬ÂSimilarly, the Tor Project, which makes the browser, argues that it actually keeps normal people from becoming victims of crime.Ã¢â¬ÅYes, criminals could in theory use Tor, but they already have better options, and it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things,Ã¢â¬Â the group write in an FAQ on abuse of its software. Ã¢â¬ÅAt the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and so on.http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/dark-net-what-is-it-and-what-are-the-dangers-of-the-governments-secret-browsing-crackdown-9917649.html ;GCHQ agents to hunt down child porn in 'dark net' -- CameronPublished time: December 12, 2014 02:18 A special unit of the British spy agency GCHQ has been tasked with roaming the ""dark net"" to locate child pornography images and weed out online abusers, according to Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron.Made up of agents from the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the National Crime Agency, the joint task force will hunt down online pedophiles with the same ""effort"" used by the spy agency when it goes after terrorists, the prime minister revealed.""We are going to go after these people with every bit of effort that we go after terrorists and other international criminals,"" Cameron said at the We Protect Children Online summit in London.""The dark net is the next side of the problem, where pedophiles and perverts are sharing images, not using the normal parts of the internet that we all use,"" he said.CameronÃ¢â¬â¢s reference to the ""dark net"" refers to hidden parts of the internet that are hard to access for a general user.GCHQ has assisted with child pornography investigations in the past, but this is the first time the agency has formed a permanent unit for the purpose.Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (Reuters / Umit Bektas)Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (Reuters / Umit Bektas)""We are committed to eliminating digital hiding places for child abusers,"" GCHQ director Robert Hannigan said, as quoted by AFP.Cameron also revealed a new law prohibiting adults from sending children ""sexual"" messages.""If you ask a child to take their clothes off and send you a picture, you are as guilty as if you did that in person,"" he said.It will also be illegal for anyone to have materials on how to abuse children -- something Cameron referred to as ""pedophile training manuals.""The prime minister also praised what has been achieved so far, stating that authorities have already taken down tens of thousands of images and will eliminate ""millions"" more with the cooperation of Google and Facebook.Cameron described one success story: ""One gang in the Philippines was arranging the sexual abuse of children, filming it and then live streaming it to paying customers across the world.""The investigation began after a British officer analyzed a computer belonging to a sex offender. The gang was eventually stopped; 29 people were arrested and 15 children rescued.The summit in London was attended by representatives from more than 50 countries, 23 technology giants, and nine NGOs. http://rt.com/uk/213699-uk-child-pornography-cghq/ "

I nearly spat out my drink (I didn't though because it was a 12 year old single malt!), the only response I could think to give (realising now it was probably in poor taste) was ""Well I'm quite sure all the men and women who got on planes on 9/11 felt safe as well.""

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","6041.0","2014-12-12T20:18:02","I told you this day was coming...","General Discussion/Security"," Unfortunately, yes. The really sad part of this is that they will regard this as 'normal'. The framers of the American constitution could never have envisaged a society like the one we live in, with ubiquitous surveillance. The idea that every word, every thought, every utterance could be recorded and potentially used against someone in future would have filled them with absolute horror. Even Eric Blair would have been astounded, especially at the fact that many people are spending their own money to purchase their very own telescreens -- no legal coercion required whatsoever.    Things have reached their absolute nadir in the United Kingdom. In the UK, if someone found out you were using Tor, they would likely think you involved in paedophilia. It's beyond insane there. Old ladies (in their 60s and 70s) have been threatened by security staff for taking photos of a playground area, even though there were no children in attendance. In one spectacularly stupid incident, a Welsh pediatrician had her surgery's doors and windows daubed with painted slogans because some of the local toughs conflated pediatrician with paedophile. (This is a true story -- you can't make up stuff this stupid!)  The sad fact of the matter is, that a goodly percentage of the population in Britain, and also in North America, are of the opinion that the 'protection of children' trumps privacy rights.  Furthermore, they would contend that anyone opposed to surveillance must be a criminal with something to hide.  I had thought some of the darker visions of the Cypherpunks were perhaps overblown; now, if anything, they understated the case.   1984 was a classic piece of dystopian fiction, however, I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that Orwell was an optimist.

Several years back, there was a move by the UK government to mandate the blocking by UK ISPs of sites carrying alleged 'child abuse materials'.  While the scheme was generally well-received, there were nonetheless those who warned that this was just the beginning. The critics warned that it was only a matter of time before ISPs would be forced to block other types of materials.   Well, the other shoe has now dropped.  Apparently, UK ISPs are now required  by law to block file-sharing sites, for example the Pirate Bay. One such site that I occasionally visit has actually setup a second domain for use by those users unfortunate enough to reside in the UK -- this is to get around these site blocks.

In a judgment released today, Justice Patricia Courtney ruled that Dotcom had to make full disclosure of his assets, including those that were not subject to current freezing orders.  Millions of dollars of the internet entrepreneur's funds and assets, including cars, jewellery and property, have been frozen for more than two years under restraining orders accepted for registration in New Zealand.  A High Court judge ruled that the assets be released back to Dotcom, but the police are appealing against that decision, and the studios had launched their own battle to keep the known assets frozen.  However, the movie studios believed Dotcom had access to assets that were outside the scope of the restraining orders and was disposing of them.  The studios said that even if they were successful in their copyright infringement lawsuit filed against Dotcom in April, any judgment may go ""unsatisfied"" if he was disposing of his assets.  Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Disney Enterprises, Paramount Pictures Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions, Columbia Pictures Industries and Warner Bros Entertainment in April filed the suit against Dotcom in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  Warner Music Group, UMG Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment and Capital Records later joined the fray.  The studios said Dotcom had ""facilitated, encouraged and profited"" from illegal file-sharing on the Megaupload site worth more than US$100 million (NZ$117.5m).  Dotcom opposed the studios' application to reveal his assets.  The Megaupload founder argued that a judgment on the studios' US case against him would not be enforceable in New Zealand and there was no danger he would not be able to pay the studios if a ruling went their way.  Dotcom's estranged wife, Mona Dotcom, was an interested party and supported her husband's opposition to the application by the studios.  Justice Courtney said she accepted the studios' argument that Dotcom had access to assets outside the $11.8m subject to freezing orders.  Last month, he offered a $5m bounty to a whistleblower with information on any ""unlawful or corrupt conduct"" by entities associated with the US government or the Hollywood movie industry.

I had nothing on my computer but some downloaded porn pictures/movies, a couple ROMs and Emulators, and the cookbook, didn't really care at the time about security. I have since moved TOR off my hdd, I have tails in a USB, a USB for a VM and tails together, and I have done an Out-of-box factory reset to my machine running Windows 7.  I read not to long after I downloaded TOR that anyone that googled TOR would have prying eyes placed on them. For this reason I did the reset. Does anyone out there know if this will delete any malware that may have been place on my hard drive, or is there malware out there that can hide from such a thing?

Loosely there are suggestions to relax territorial restrictions on deployment of malware/viruses/JavaScript to pave the way for more rapid and presumably frequent deployment of deanonymization techniques.  Now better get those Pi middle-boxes in between your endpoint and the Internet - no need to take unnecessary risks.  An inline pi or something similar could save your bacon if you get hit by a JavaScript, browser or other content driven remote attack.  Anyway here are some tasters...      ","MEMO TO: Members, Criminal Rules Advisory CommitteeFROM: Sara Beale and Nancy King, ReportersRE: Rule 41 proposalDATE: March 17, 2014This memorandum presents an amendment to Rule 41 (Tab B) that would permit a court,in a district where activities related to a crime have occurred, to issue a warrant authorizingremote access searches of electronic storage media and electronic information located within oroutside that district. The Department of Justice requested that the Committee consider thisamendment in September of 2013, see Tab C, Letter of Acting Assistant Attorney GeneralRaman to Judge Raggi, September 18, 2013 (hereinafter DOJ Letter 9/18/2013).Judge Raggi referred the proposal to a Rule 41 Subcommittee chaired by Judge Keenan,whose members are Judge Kethledge, Judge Rice, Mr. Filip, Professor Kerr, and Mr.Wroblewski (representing the Department of Justice). In general, subcommittee members agreedthat there are persuasive justifications for an amendment authorizing remote electronic searchesoutside the authorizing district. The more difficult question was whether to propose a narrowamendment that would reach only a limited subset of cases (described as scenario 1 below), or amore general provision.;Identification of the Computer Server Hosting Website AThrough investigation, the FBI identified the physical computer server that hostsWebsite A. That computer is located in this district. However, the identities of the administratorsand users of Website A remain unknown. Users of Tor-based websites cannot be identified from theIP address logs of the website. Such logs will contain only the IP addresses of Tor âexit nodesâutilized by the users. Instead, the identities of the administrators and users of Website A canpotentially be determined using the Network Investigative Technique described below.;THE NETWORK INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUEBased on my training, experience, and the investigation described above, I haveconcluded that using a network investigative technique may help FBI agents locate the users of thechild pornography Website A. Accordingly, I request authority to use the NIT, which will bedeployed on Website A to investigate any user or administrator who logs into any of Website A byentering a username and password.In the normal course of operation, websites send content to visitors. A userâscomputer downloads that content and uses it to display web pages on the userâs computer. Under theNIT authorized by this warrant, the website would augment that content with some additionalcomputer instructions. When a computer successfully downloads those instructions from Website A,the instructions are designed to cause the âactivatingâ computer to deliver certain information to acomputer controlled by or known to the government. That information is described with particularityon the warrant (in Attachment B of this affidavit), and the warrant authorizes obtaining no otherinformation. The NIT will not deny the user of the âactivatingâ computer access to any data orfunctionality of that computer.The NIT will reveal to the government environmental variables and certain registry-type information that may assist in identifying the computer, its location, and the user of thecomputer, which constitute evidence of violations of the statutes cited in paragraph 5. In particular,the NIT will reveal to the government no information other than the following items, which are alsodescribed in Attachment B:â¢ The âactivatingâ computerâs actual IP address, and the date and time that theNIT determines what that IP address is;â¢ A unique identifier (e.g., a series of numbers, letters, and/or specialcharacters) to distinguish the data from that of other âactivatingâ computers.That unique identifier will be sent with and collected by the NIT;â¢ The type of operating system running on the computer, including type (e.g.,Windows), version (e.g., Windows 7), and architecture (e.g., x 86);â¢ Information about whether the NIT has already been delivered to theâactivatingâ computer;â¢ The âactivatingâ computerâs Host Name. A Host Name is a name that isassigned to a device connected to a computer network that is used to identifythe device in various forms of electronic communication, such ascommunications over the Internet;â¢ The âactivatingâ computerâs Media Access Control (âMACâ) address. Theequipment that connects a computer to a network is commonly referred to asa network adapter. Most network adapters have a MAC address assigned bythe manufacturer of the adapter that is designed to be a unique identifyingnumber. A unique MAC address allows for proper routing ofcommunications on a network. Because the MAC address does not changeand is intended to be unique, a MAC address can allow law enforcement toidentify whether communications sent or received at different times areassociated with the same adapterDuring the up to thirty day period that the NIT is deployed on Website A, each timethat any user or administrator logs into Website A by entering a username and password, the NITauthorized by this warrant will attempt to cause the userâs computer to send the above-describedinformation to a computer controlled by or known to the government in [District].;We propose to send an e-mail to [redacted] yahoo.com, saying that thedatabase will go back on line. We intend to insert a CIPAV into this e-mail.In general, a CIPAV utilizes standard Internet computer commands thatcomputers broadcast on local networks and on the Internet. Each type of information will bediscussed in turn. We plan to use the gather three types of information: IP addresses andenvironmental variables; MAC addresses; and registry information.The first type of information that the CIPAV will gather are what are referredto as IP addresses and environment variables. IP addresses are discussed above inParagraph 10. It is the equivalent of a telephone number on the Internet. Environmentvariables are information that the requesting computer sends to a server so that the serverknows, for example, how to format a response that the requesting computer can read andrender for the viewer to use. For example, if a person attempts to view a website, his/hercomputer will send information about the type of Internet browser the user is employing sothat the requested server will know what type of information to send back.This affidavit is submitted in support of an application for a search warrant topermit me in conjunction with other agents of the FBI and the Information Technology staffof the College to use a tool known a Computer andInternet Protocol Address Verifier (CIPAV) for the purpose of identifying and locating theperson who has been making unlawful access to the computers of the College...

But also it moves the Tor process off your secure workstation onto an independent and  isolated system so if the Tor software ever exposes a significant flaw which can lead to disclosure of information (this week being a good example) or even remote code execution then the impact is restricted to the Pi only which, while serious, is far less serious than a breach of your workstation which contains passwords, data, private keys etc.  Ideally you should also be running your browser on another Pi away from your keys and data and just copy/pasting between your browser window and your desktop.

"The Hub Forums","ph4nt0m","2543.0","2014-04-13T08:18:37","Department of Justice and rule 41 ammendments for deanoymization attacks","General Discussion/Security","Website A is reference to a CP forum hidden service that was called pedoforum. It was run by the same guy who ran cam-a-lot apparently, the site that just made the news for having been busted a year or so ago, that collected videos of teenagers jacking off on webcams (they called cam-a-lot website B). From the wording of that it sounds like they didn't target casual browsers of the forum, but only people who registered accounts. In any case, we should have expected them to do things like this. The best defense is having two computers dedicated for anonymous activity, one being a Tor Router on some secure OS like OpenBSD, and the other being a hardened system for browsing on. Physical isolation is the diamond standard for protecting from this sort of attack, and obviously they are going to keep doing this type of attack more and more, so it is time for people to rapidly start using physical isolation. Throw in a VM still though to hide hardware serial numbers. Another technique to protect from attacks like this is to use virtual machine based isolation by itself. You can also protect from attacks like this with software and/or hardware firewalls, and with process level firewalls like mandatory access controls.   So pretty much if this concerns you, the things to look into are how to protect from this sort of attack with:  A. Firewalls (complicated, often requires extensive knowledge of exactly how it needs to be configured, both the firewall and the system itself) B. Mandatory access controls (Similar to firewalls, also requires extensive knowledge) C. Physical Isolation (Requires much less knowledge, and much less to go wrong as well. It's a very powerful technique) D. Virtual Isolation (Requires the least amount of knowledge, trivial to configure, provides significant protection but not as much as physical isolation)  You also need to know how to harden your browser. Like, disable javascript on Tor browser for sure. If you don't need them, disable images too, so long as you understand that this could increase linkability risk, though this wont matter much if you only go to a few websites, or only go to websites you do illegal things on. Not using Windows is one of the biggest favors you can do for yourself as well, use some distribution of Linux instead, or maybe even some BSD distro.   Think of how you can add amnesia in as well, so even if you are compromised the attackers foothold is lost after some period of time. Tails has Amnesia built into it for example, and has protection from this sort of attack via the Firewall method, the firewall having been configured by professionals. Whonix goes with the virtual isolation technique for protecting from this sort of attack, but it doesn't have amnesia so an attacker can still gain a permanent foothold they just can't easily get your real IP address (though they can spy on your entire VM besides that, so you will deanonymize yourself if you send an address in plaintext for example). You could get amnesia by using a stable operating system without many updates for it, and loading it from a read only medium into memory or something, maybe from a hard drive with a write blocker. And only load it in a writable format when updating the software on it intentionally, never when in the process of doing sensitive things. You could also use snapshots to do the same thing for virtual isolation.   The biggest thing to also keep in mind, for our threat model, is the risk of an attacker deanonymizing you with your plaintext address even if they can't get your IP address. To protect from this your address needs to be encrypted before it passes through exposed security domains. The best way to do this is with air gaps, or virtual air gaps at least.   Security on this level is really hard to get into, and even harder to maintain. But if you follow the already known best practices, you can make it extremely unlikely that an FBI level attacker can pwn you with this technique. NSA TAO is a different story though! ",""
"The Hub Forums","El Presidente","2543.0","2014-04-13T22:31:57","Department of Justice and rule 41 ammendments for deanoymization attacks","General Discussion/Security","This was our take on PI middle boxes last year and other than a read only file-system we do'nt have much to add to it. WiFi used for one of the interfaces (either). We would like to see a build script than could be applied to a vanilla fresh Rasbian build. It wouldn't be that much work for somebody. ","We have taken a slightly different approach with this in the past, one that provides a little additional security at the cost of a little usability. We provide it here for information - it may be useful for some.The fundamental difference is that rather than transparently route all traffic from the secure box and into tor we only route explicitly defined traffic.The Middle BoxA simple TOR client dual-homed host, ideally on a physical host. It will have two network interfaces, a public interface which connects to the Internet (ideally through a NATting router or firewall) and a private interface. This system must be hardened because it will be able to establish arbitrary connections to the Internet. It will run TOR in client mode and will expose the SOCKS proxy to the private network only. Ideally it should be hard-coded to connect to trusted guard nodes, preferably ones that you either run or know to be safe. At the least the guard nodes should be local to you in network terms. This system should be configured to drop all inbound connections on the public interface regardless of any upstream firewalls. The system should also be configured to drop all traffic on and out on the private interface except inbound traffic to the local SOCKS proxy port (9050/tcp or similar). For good measure the middle box should also drop all outbound UDP traffic to the Internet.The Private networkThis network exists purely between the middle box and the secure box.  Ideally this should be a simple cross-over cable which connects the two systems. Wireless is acceptable but the key thing is that the private network cannot route anywhere other then between the Middle and Secure boxes and it will be carrying plain-text, sensitive traffic and thus must be protected from eavesdropping. The private network must have no default gateway and no DNS.The Secure BoxThe key tenet of this system is that it does not know where it is or have any way of finding out where it is. This system has a single network interface on the private network. Again, there must be no default gateway, no DNS nothing. Just a simple static IP address and no more. The local firewall (iptables) should be configured on this system to drop all inbound traffic and block all outbound traffic except outbound to the SOCKS port on the middle box. The browser on this system should be configured to use the SOCKS proxy on the middle box. If there is a requirement to use any other application other than the browser then it must explicitly be configured to use SOCKS or, failing that, executed using 'torsocks' which again will use the SOCKS proxy on the middle box. Ideally the hostname of this system should be 'computer' or 'server' and only one user should be configured called 'user', ensure the mac address of the system is modified from the hardware default at boot time - ideally randomized each boot. In terms of OS, anything that is non persistent is nearly always better such as TAILS. The systems should have no microphone, no camera, no GPS and ideally no wireless (wlan, bluetooth, GSM, etc). Nothing that allows it to interact with the real world in any way except via that SOCKS proxy.When looking at the hardening of the secure box, imagine you are a bad guy somewhere who has gained unrestricted access to the system and ask yourself:a) can you break out of it in any way that will cause you to generate network traffic that will not go through the SOCKS port and into TOR? if you can then something is wrong, rethink.b) can you extract anything from the system that provides IRL identity information - for instance address details that you might use to copy/paste into order forms? If you can find anything of value then something is wrong, rethink.This model can be virtualized easily enough but at the cost of some security. If virtualized then make sure file sharing from guest to host is disabled, shared clipboards etc. The virtualization software should be configured to provide as much isolation between the guest and host systems as possible.Our preferred setup for this is simple and uses a Rasberry PI as the middle box and an old laptop connected via a cross-over ethernet cable. The PI connects wirelessly to the local broadband router.Internet-------[Router]---------[Pi Middle Box]---------[Secured Laptop]"

I don't plan to create accounts on CP sites nor am I a vendor, so physical isolation is probably overkill for me. Virtual isolation is free and does a much better job than no isolation, though.  This was a decent although incomplete ordered list of security setups with physical + virtual isolation at the top:  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=173.0  It was incomplete in that it didn't mention options like OpenBSD, which you mention, although the BSDs may be overrated. I don't know if BSD jails are safer than Qubes with Xen for example. Despite the tone of this blog, it makes some good points  https://aboutthebsds.wordpress.com  Some examples  https://aboutthebsds.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/20/ https://aboutthebsds.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/freebsd-jails-are-a-huge-security-danger/  Not sure about this claim though: ""Worse, Theo de Raadt willing allowed government agencies and possible terrorist organizations to put back doors into OpenBSD. An example of this is shown in December 2010 when de Raadt allowed FBI agents to plant backdoors in OpenBSDâs Cryptographic Framework which they had taken from Linux and illegally removed the GPL license.""  Then he goes on to say: ""The firewall PF which OpenBSD claimed to have invented (which in fact is a copy of iptables with most of the features stripped away and the remaining code completely mucked up) has 3 buffer overflow vulnerabilities which when combine with the fact that it is running within the kernel can be used by hackers to taken control of OpenBSDâs kernel.""  I don't know enough about the BSDs to determine when this guy is trolling or being incendiary and when he's telling the truth, but I haven't read any good rebuttals to it either.","So pretty much if this concerns you"

The mass deployment of the FH exploit on every FH visitor guaranteed that it would be discovered. So LE only uses high value 0days on high value targets. The FH exploit was a 37day and a majority of FH visitors were immune to it either because they had up to date browser bundles or weren't in Windows.

This release contains a fix for the update loop issue present in 4.0.7. It is otherwise identical to that release.  Both 4.0.7 and 4.0.8 contain an update to the included Tor software, to fix two crash bugs in the version of the Tor software included prior to 4.0.7. One crash bug affects only people using the bundled tor binary to run hidden services, and the other crash bug allows a malicious website or Tor exit node to crash the underlying tor client by inducing it to load a resource from a hidden service with a malformed descriptor. These bugs do not allow remote code execution, but because they can be used by arbitrary actors to perform a denial of service, we are issuing a security update to address them.  There will be no corresponding 4.5-alpha release for this fix, to allow us to focus on stabilizing that series for release in ~2 weeks.  Note to MacOS users: This is the last planned release that will run on 32 bit MacOS versions. Users of Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and newer versions will be automatically updated to the 64 bit Tor Browser 4.5 when it is stabilized in April, and we expect this transition to be smooth for those users. However, the update process for 10.6 and 10.7 users will unfortunately not be automatic. For more details, see the original end-of-life blog post.  Here is the complete changelog since 4.0.6 (covering 4.0.7 and 4.0.8):      All Platforms         Bug 15637: Fix update loop due to improper versioning         Update Tor to 0.2.5.12         Update NoScript to 2.6.9.21   Zaphod ",""

","General Discussion/Security","[Announce] GnuPG 1.4.19 released (with SCA fix) Werner Koch wk at gnupg.org Fri Feb 27 21:20:54 CET 2015      Previous message: [Announce] GnuPG 2.0.27 ""stable"" released     Next message: [Announce] Libgcrypt 1.6.3 released (with SCA fix)     Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]  Hello!  We are pleased to announce the availability of a new GnuPG classic release: Version 1.4.19.  This release mitigates two new side channel attacks.  Updating any GnuPG 1.4 version to 1.4.19 is suggested!  To update a GnuPG 2.0 or 2.1 version you need to update the shared library Libgcrypt to version 1.6.3.   What is GnuPG =============  The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC-4880 and better known as PGP.  GnuPG, also known as GPG, allows to encrypt and sign data and communication, features a versatile key management system as well as access modules for public key directories.  GnuPG itself is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries making use of GnuPG are available.  GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  Three different versions of GnuPG are actively maintained:  - GnuPG ""modern"" (2.1) is the latest development with a lot of new   features.    - GnuPG ""stable"" (2.0) is the current stable version for general use.   This is what most users are currently using.  - GnuPG ""classic"" (1.4) is the old standalone version which is most   suitable for older or embedded platforms.  This announcement is about   a release of this version.  You may not install ""modern"" (2.1) and ""stable"" (2.0) at the same time.  However, it is possible to install ""classic"" (1.4) along with any of the other versions.   What's New in GnuPG 1.4.19 ==========================   * Use ciphertext blinding for Elgamal decryption [CVE-2014-3591].    See http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp/ for details.   * Fixed data-dependent timing variations in modular exponentiation    [related to CVE-2015-0837, Last-Level Cache Side-Channel Attacks    are Practical].   * Detect faulty use of --verify on detached signatures.   * Changed the PKA method to use CERT records and hashed names.   * New import option ""keep-ownertrust"".   * Support algorithm names when generating keys using the --command-fd    method.   * Updated many translations.   * Updated build system.   * Fixed a regression in keyserver import   * Fixed argument parsing for option --debug-level.   * Fixed DoS based on bogus and overlong key packets.   * Fixed bugs related to bogus keyrings.   * The usual minor minor bug fixes.   Getting the Software ====================  Please follow the instructions found at https://gnupg.org/download/ or read on:  GnuPG 1.4.19 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or direct from its primary FTP server.  The list of mirrors can be found at https://gnupg.org/mirrors.html .  Note that GnuPG is not available at ftp.gnu.org.  On ftp.gnupg.org you find these files:   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2  (3627k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2.sig  This is the GnuPG 1.4.19 source code compressed using BZIP2 and its OpenPGP signature.   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.gz  (5020k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.gz.sig  This is the same GnuPG 1.4.19 source code compressed using GZIP and its OpenPGP signature.   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe (1586k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe.sig  This is GnuPG 1.4.19 compiled for Microsoft Windows and its OpenPGP signature.  This is a command line only version; the source files are the same as above.  Note, that this is a minimal installer and unless you are only in need for the simple the gpg binary, you are better off using the full featured installer at https://www.gpg4win.org .   Checking the Integrity ======================  In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following ways:   * If you already have a version of GnuPG installed, you can simply    verify the supplied signature.  For example to verify the signature    of the file gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2 you would use this command:       gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2     This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.    You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and    made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that    this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint    against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by    checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.    See below for information on the signing keys.   * If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have    to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do    this is either ""sha1sum"" or ""shasum"".  Assuming you downloaded the    file gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2, you would run the command like this:       sha1sum gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2     and check that the output matches the first line from the    following list:  5503f7faa0a0e84450838706a67621546241ca50  gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2 d0cf40cc42ce057d7d747908ec21a973a423a508  gnupg-1.4.19.tar.gz dc03ae4e4c3e8fe0583b37dd6c3124f94246d2f8  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe   Release Signing Keys ====================  To guarantee that a downloaded GnuPG version has not been tampered by malicious entities we provide signature files for all tarballs and binary versions.  The keys are also signed by the long term keys of their respective owners.  Current releases are signed by one or more of these four keys:    2048R/4F25E3B6 2011-01-12 [expires: 2019-12-31]   Key fingerprint = D869 2123 C406 5DEA 5E0F  3AB5 249B 39D2 4F25 E3B6   Werner Koch (dist sig)    rsa2048/E0856959 2014-10-29 [expires: 2019-12-31]   Key fingerprint = 46CC 7308 65BB 5C78 EBAB  ADCF 0437 6F3E E085 6959   David Shaw (GnuPG Release Signing Key) <dshaw 'at' jabberwocky.com>    rsa2048/33BD3F06 2014-10-29 [expires: 2016-10-28]   Key fingerprint = 031E C253 6E58 0D8E A286  A9F2 2071 B08A 33BD 3F06   NIIBE Yutaka (GnuPG Release Key) <gniibe 'at' fsij.org>    rsa2048/7EFD60D9 2014-10-19 [expires: 2020-12-31]   Key fingerprint = D238 EA65 D64C 67ED 4C30  73F2 8A86 1B1C 7EFD 60D9   Werner Koch (Release Signing Key)  You may retrieve these files from the keyservers using this command    gpg --recv-keys 249B39D24F25E3B6 04376F3EE0856959 \                   2071B08A33BD3F06 8A861B1C7EFD60D9  The keys are also available at https://gnupg.org/signature_key.html . Note that this mail has been signed using my standard PGP key.   Support ========  Please consult the archive of the gnupg-users mailing list before reporting a bug <https://gnupg.org/documentation/mailing-lists.html>. We suggest to send bug reports for a new release to this list in favor of filing a bug at <https://bugs.gnupg.org>.  For commercial support requests we keep a list of known service companies at:    https://gnupg.org/service.html  If you are a developer and you may need a certain feature for your project, please do not hesitate to bring it to the gnupg-devel mailing list for discussion.   Thanks ======  We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing lists.  Since the start of the funding campaign in December several thousand people have been kind enough to donate a total of 250000 Euro to support this project.  In addition the Linux Foundation gave a grant of $ 60000 for 2015, Stripe.com and Facebook.com each pledged $ 50000 per year.  I am amazed by this superb and unexpected support for the GnuPG project. This does not only allow us to continue the project and allowed to hire second full time developer, but also gives the resources to improve things which have been delayed for too long.  *Thank you all !*   Salam-Shalom,     Werner  ========================================================  [Announce] GnuPG 2.0.27 ""stable"" released Werner Koch wk at gnupg.org Wed Feb 18 16:29:12 CET 2015      Previous message: [Announce] GnuPG 2.1.2 released     Next message: [Announce] GnuPG 1.4.19 released (with SCA fix)     Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]  Hello!

The security audit will come ... if only because it reassures rightfully cautious prospective users .. and hence lifts a barrier to adoption.  Given the problems with using regular (centralised) email services some of us have decided to abandon email altogether and stick with bitmessage. Once a security audit has been performed (and the recommended changes have been implemented) i expect many other people will follow suit and also abandon email.   Time will tell... but certainly, these are interesting times.  Recent discussions on the #BitChirp channel suggest that there might one day be a web based 'sending only' version of bitmessage. Basically allowing you to send messages to bitmessage addressses  from a website.       It is recommended that you do not use any websites that claim to offer a _full_ web-based implementation of bitmessage since this is probably a going to be a 'scam' site .. or a LEO trap.  This is because there is the unavoidable problem that you will be trusting the website with your private keys.  That's a definite no-no!  A 'sending-msgs-only' web-based implementation of bitmessage could be  relatively more secure.  In this scenario the user _only_ specifies the  BM-address of the recipient.   He/she doesn't not specify his/her own BM-address, or email address and does not need to expose any private keys to the website. The web sites generates a random, disposable BM-address for the sender  (one time use only).    But even the 'sending-only' website proposal suffers from the problem that messages could be spoofed.  There's no way to specify that messages purportedly coming from, say,  Nightcrawler, really came from Nightcrawler.  And that's true unless Nightcrawler signed his message with his gpg private key... (and you had his public key with which you could verify his signature).  Personally, however, i  would only trust such a 'sending-only'  website if the original bitmessage team set it up.   Okay.. that's not true, i would probably be inclined to trust the tor project team, the blockchain team  the bitcoin and litecoin teams..   (but you get the idea).  Have a nice day .. and be happy.  playground :-)  PS.. in answer to the original question, my experience with bitmessage has been very good.  There seem to be some very clued up people on bitmessage.

I especially like the fact that all the encryption and signing, and then later the decryption and verification are all done under the hood.  I don't have to think about master-keys and subkeys, about keyservers or anything else.  Any user can take advantage of the power of encryption without having to  first gain a thorough understand of encryption and without having to study  the openPGP/gpg user's manual to figure out the options.   My grandmother could use it.  And let's not forget that it's fully distributed.  There are no central servers.   There's no where for LEO to go to serve a warrant.  This offers the tantalising prospect that we can completely defeat  the surveillance ambitions of various (evil) govt agencies around the world.

With Silk Road at the time of this post now boasting over 25,000 members, it is easy to get that these occurrences are likely going to increase and unfortunately some people are going to fall for them. This new one is directed at vendors, but it nonetheless should serve as an example of the type of scams that people are going to be trying to pull on members of this forum and other forums.      The user who sent out this message actually used the name  Dread Pirates Robert, which is similar but not correct. One thing you should be aware of, is that any type of announcement like this from a high ranking Administrator like DPR will always be signed with their PGP signature. And remember, we discussed how to verify these signatures in a previous post. I remember when a moderator named  Sarge was in charge of vendor bonds, there was a user with the name Sarrge (two r's) that was trying to scam vendors into sending their bonds to his address instead and unfortunately, several people fell for this scam.     Please always check if there is a PGP signature, and if there is not, kindly ask the Administrator or Moderator to resend the message to you using a signature. Protect yourself by verifying the name and make sure this user has an Administrator or Moderator status on the forum. Be safe!","Dear Valued Vendor,Due to the recent instability of the site, and our programmers inability to remedy the problems in a timely manner, we are going to have to temporarily shut down vendor accounts. Since we can't just stop operation of the site completely, we are forced to develop a way for only some of the vendors to go into a temporary vacation mode. In need of recent server upgrades, as well as this new method we are implementing, it has occured to us that the only way to pick which vendors are going to remain in business is by how much sales/profit they are doing, as well as how much being a vendor on our site means to them. Here's how this is going to work:If you would like to keep vending on the site during our upgrades/repairs, we are going to require that you pay an additional .3BTC bond to us. If you pay this .3BTC bond, your account will remain active and you will keep vending while we work to fix the problems. If you do not pay this .3BTC bond, your account will be temporarily put into vacation mode status and you will be unable to vend until we locate and remedy the problem. We are very sorry for these changes!In the event you do pay the bond, as soon as the vending opens back up to everyone, you will have your .3BTC bond returned, and you will receive a premium vendor account status. You will have a title on your page that displays you as ""Hardcore Vendor"". We are terribly sorry we have to ask this of all our hardworking vendors, but there is really no other way for us to decide WHO gets to keep vending and who has to wait until we fix things.Our team is working hard at the problem, and we estimate it will be no longer than a week for the changes to be made and vending to open back up to everyone.Vendors who will pay bond: Please send .3BTC to BTC Address: 1NbEs2rJgreRUvjp9o7hUWo3akeLA3EfFYVendors who are unable to pay bond: Your accounts will go into vacation mode at 12:01AM UTC February 2nd.Let us never forget this recent hurdle in our battle for freedom. But let us not allow it to stop our fight, either â it is now time to simply pick ourselves back up, dust ourselves off, and continue fighting this revolution like weâve never fought it before.Iâm proud to have you all at my side.Yours LoyallyDread Pirate Roberts"
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.40","2014-02-04T16:45:49","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," This is going to be a short post about a mistake we can all learn from when a Harvard student emailed a bomb threat to his school while using tor to avoid a final exam.      http://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik/2013/12/18/harvard-student-receives-f-for-tor-failure-while-sending-anonymous-bomb-threat/      There is not much for me to add other than the fact that, if you are planning on doing some freedom fighting, activism or just using Silk Road, make sure that you are able to do so where using tor is not going to raise some flags. In the case of this student, he was likely the only student at Harvard using tor at the moment this email was sent, and when the authorities came to his dorm he quickly admitted he was responsible.      He likely never would have been caught, but remember when you use tor, others can be aware that you are using it. A better idea for him would have been to connect to another computer remotely and have that computer connected to tor to send the email. This way, they never could have seen his computer connected to tor. I would not worry about using tor on a regular basis from your home, because there are hundreds of thousands of tor users, but it is again, something to be aware of. tor will not cover your bad OpSec mistakes like in the case of Eldo Kim.","...the student âtook steps to disguise his identityâ by using Tor, a software which allows users to browse the web anonymously, and Guerrilla Mail, a service which allows users to create free, temporary email addresses.Despite 20-year-old Eldo Kimâs goal of anonymity, his attempts to mask his identity led authorities right to his front door. Does that mean that Tor failed a user looking to delay his âPolitics of American Educationâ exam? Not in the slightest.While the Harvard student did indeed use Tor, it was his other sloppy security measures that led to his arrest. The complaint says the university âwas able to determine that, in the several hours leading up to the receipt of the e-mail messages â¦ Eldo Kim accessed Tor using Harvardâs wireless network.âWhat Kim didnât realize is that Tor, which masks online activity, doesnât hide the fact that you are using the software. In analyzing the headers of the emails sent through the Guerrilla Mail account, authorities were able to determine that the anonymous sender was connected to the anonymity network.Using that conclusion, they then attempted to discern which students had been using Tor on the Harvard wireless network around the time of the threats. Before firing up Tor, Kim had to log on to the schoolâs wireless system, which requires users to authenticate with a username and password. By going through network logs and looking for users who connected to the publicly-known IP addresses that are part of the Tor network, the university was able to cross-reference users that were using both Tor and its wireless internet around the time the bomb threats were received."

During a period of 15 months, there were around 400,000 images and 11,000 videos uploaded to a central server run by the group and shared by the members. The reason we know that, is because during that 15 months, the FBI performed an undercover operation to infiltrate the group in hopes of apprehending the members. They successfully apprehended 1 in 3 members of the group. One of those who remain free to date, was the leader of the group, who also went by the online name YardBird.      How is it possible that after so much effort was put in by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Queensland Police Service, that people high up on the wanted lists were able to evade capture. They used strong cryptography, and proper OpSec rules. Let us now talk about the history of the attempted apprehension of this group.     According to the FBI.      As I said earlier, the alleged leader of this ring used the online name ""Yardbird"". Yardbird made a re-appearance on Usenet in both 2009 and 2010 on the date corresponding to the first and second anniversaries of the busts in 2008. His intent was to show that he was still free, and to answer people's questions.      One of the most important things Yardbird stated were that everyone in the group who used Tor and remailers remained free, while those who relied on services such as Privacy.LI were arrested and convicted. Privacy.li is an offshore VPN service that promises anonymity. They claim from their website the following.      And their privacy policy makes the following promise.         Yardbird further commented that several members of the group, including his second-in-command Christopher Stubbings (Helen) and Gary Lakey (Eggplant) were Privacy.LI users -- in fact he stated that they used it for everything. (Helen is currently serving a 25-year sentence in the UK, while Eggplant is serving life in an Arizona prison.)     Eggplant literally became notorious because of his constant promotion of Privacy.LI -- he continually boasted that he could not be caught because Privacy.LI did not keep logs, and they were located outside of U.S. jurisdiction.       At the end of the day, no service provider is going to go to jail for you. A simple court order can get even the toughest VPN providers to roll over on their users, because they would rather betray a $20 per month user than be fined, shut down and possibly thrown in jail for interfering with a federal investigation.      What other mistakes were made to lead to the arrest of some members of this group? The Australian police arrested a man on totally unrelated child pornography charges, and presumably as part of a plea deal, he revealed the  existence of 'the group' and handed over a PGP public/private keypair and password. Having acquired from the informer the current group PGP public/private keypair, and its passphrase meant that the police could assume this group member's identity, and furthermore, read all the encrypted traffic posted by members of the group.    So it is important to note at this time, that you no matter how comfortable you become with somebody, there is always a chance that they can become compromised. In fact, the group has a set of rules, that all members were told to abide by, and if any member was found to be breaking the following rules, they would be expelled.   The ones who got caught, were the ones who did not follow the rules by putting too much trust in their online ""friends"". We saw this in the arrest of Sabu when he helped the FBI bust his ""friends"" in LulzSec. If someone is given a deal to cut the amount of time spent in prison in half, they likely will take the deal at your expense. Below is an example of a plea versus trying to fight the charges in this exact case.      13-30 years versus life in prison, may entice even some of the hardest criminals, and if you think your online ""friend"" who you have never met in person is going to keep their mouth shut to keep you out of jail, you are in for a big surprise.      So, as you can see, the group was pretty much an open book to the police. They were completely and thoroughly penetrated. Despite that, however, the  majority of the group were still able to remain at large, and were neither positively identified nor arrested. This is due to the privacy tools (pgp, tor, nymservers, remailers) that were employed. Even with everything else being an open book, those using these tools still managed to evade capture. But you may be saying, Ok, I understand PGP, I understand tor, but what the heck is a nymserver and a remailer?      In a nutshell, an anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages (in this case an email) with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from. A nymserver also referred to as a pseudonymous remailer assigns its users a user name, and it keeps a database of instructions on how to return messages to the real user. These instructions usually involve the anonymous remailer network itself, thus protecting the true identity of the user.        Some of the advantages of using these services are to protect the intended recipient from an adversary, and also protect the sender of the message. Some of these services use what is called a common mailbox, in which all messages are stored in a central mail box with no ""To and From"" headers. It is up to the users who use the service to attempt to use their PGP keys to try and decrypt all of the messages stored in the central message box and see if they can decrypt any of them. If they can, this message is intended for them. This way it rules out again, the sender and receiver. This system of remailers, can also form a chain, in which the message is bounced off of multiple remailers before making it to its intended reicipient to widen the gap between the sender and receiver.     Another effective option some services offer is the ability to delay when the message gets sent on to the next server in the chain, or the recipient itself. If you are found to be sending out PGP encrypted traffic through some type of analysis at 5:00PM, and another person being monitored receives it at 5:01PM, it is easier to correlate that this message may be from you to the other person being monitored. At this time I have no recommendations for service to use, but I am likely to post about them in the future. In the meantime, let us get back to the ring of pedophiles shall we?      To summarize. We have seen that even the most hunted criminals, can evade capture when using strong cryptography and proper OpSec. The ring leader of one of the most investigated child pornography rings still remains at large today because those who followed the rules.","If your secure communications platform isnât being used by terrorists and pedophiles, youâre probably doing it wrong.http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-usenet-tradecraft/;There were approximately 60 members that were loosely identified, and from the 60, approximately 20 were positively identified in this group.There were numerous challenges presented during Operation Achilles. The group utilized an unprecedented level of organization and sophistication. They had a timed test for prospective new members. They had to use encryption technology and Internet-based anonymizers, re-mailing services. They also intentionally corrupted their own child pornography files and only the new members knew how to reconfigure those files to be able to read the pictures or the video. They also had the uncanny ability to monitor worldwide news pertaining to law enforcement efforts in child pornography matters in order to better educate themselves to avoid law enforcement detection.https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside/operation-achilles.mp3/view; If you need corporate and/or military strength encrypted networks, then a Virtual Private Network is the way to go. All and any traffic from and to your desktop are within an encrypted tunnel, and your originating IP-address is well concealed.http://www.privacy.li/services.html;Yes, we 101% honor your privacy, no logs, no snooping, no profiling. No legal mumbo-jumbo to disguise any hidden efforts. We believe in individualism and privacy, even anonymity.http://www.privacy.li/privacy-policy.html;I pointed out to anyone who would listen that services such as Privacy.LI were for /privacy/ -- not for anonymity. In an ideal situation, one needs both to be private as well as anonymous. Essentially, what Privacy.LI supplied was a type of VPN service, providing an encrypted tunnel for data to travel between two endpoints--the customer's computer being one endpoint, while the Privacy.LI servers provided the other. While there was a degree of privacy, there was NO anonymity at all--so it really didn't come as a  surprise that Privacy.LI's customers were among those arrested.http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html;Once the group was penetrated, the police were able to take advantage of a few factors: 1) They had the informant's computer, with all its email, PGP keys and the    like. This provided a history, which made it easier to continue the    impersonation.    2) By the time it was penetrated, the group had been operating for about 5    years. By this time, the group had jelled into a community -- people were    familiar with each other, they often let their guards down, and would    sometimes reveal tidbits of personal information. This is especially the    case when they thought their messages were secure, and beyond the ability    of the police to intercept--they would say things that they would *never*   say in the open. http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html;    Never reveal true identity to another member of the group    Never communicate with another member of the group outside the usenet channel    Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet        No member can positively identify another    Members do not reveal personally identifying information    Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly        If a member violates a security rule, e.g. fails to encrypt a message        Periodically to reduce chance of law enforcement discovery    On each newsgroup migration        Create new PGP key pair, unlinking from previous messages        Each member creates a new nickname            Nickname theme selected by Yardbirdhttp://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/yardbirds-effective-usenet-tradecraft/;...seven of the U.S. subjects pleaded guilty pre-trial to a 40-count indictment and received federal sentences ranging from 13-30 years in prison. The remaining seven defendants opted for a joint, simultaneous trial. All seven were convicted by a jury and subsequently sentenced to life in prison.https://www.fbi.gov/news/podcasts/inside/operation-achilles.mp3/view;Leaving aside my personal feelings about pedophiles, I brought up this case as an example for several reasons: 1) Child pornography is a serious crime in virtually every jurisdiction.    As this example demonstrates, police will work together, even across    national boundaries, to investigate these crimes. They are willing    to invest considerable time, manpower and money in pursuit of these    suspects. The only other crimes which usually merit this type of    approach are drug/gun-running or terrorism. The level of effort    expended in pursuing this group can be seen in that even FBI    executive assistant director J. Stephen Tidwell was involved.       Normally one would not expect FBI personnel that highly placed    to be involved -- this shows the level of importance placed on    this particular investigation. (A year or so after the busts,    Yardbird himself expressed astonishment that the FBI would    consider his group such a priority.)       2) This case is the only one that I'm aware of, where suspects were    using sophisticated tools like PGP, Tor, anonymous remailers and    nymservers. 3) This case underscores the effectiveness of these tools even against    well-funded, powerful opponents like the FBI, Europol, and Interpol.    (N.B.: FWIW, those who were caught used either inappropriate and/or    ineffective tools and techniques to protect themselves.    4) I fully understand most people's disgust at the types of crimes/   criminals being discussed here. That said, it is important to    remember that one simply cannot design a system that provides    protection for one class of people, but denies it for another.    You can't, for example, deploy a system that provides privacy/   anonymity for political dissidents, or whistle blowers, and yet    denies it to pedophiles -- either *everyone* is safe, or NO ONE    is safe. This may not be palatable, but these are the facts.http://dee.su/uploads/baal.html"
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.40","2014-02-04T16:48:07","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," This post is a continuation from the last one. The threat of being ripped off or scammed on LocalBitcoin is a very real threat. One that you need to be aware of.     I want to share a few stories with you.      Remember, the risk of something like the above happening increases with the amount of Bitcoin being traded for FIAT currency (Government paper or electronic currency). So if you are trying to unload a few Bitcoins to a seller, you may find yourself in a similar situation from time to time and it is best to prepare yourself in case this happen. Bring a friend with you, have them wait at the door in case the person tries to run away, or better yet, multiple friends. If you live in a country or state where it is legal to carry a concealed weapon, then you might want to consider doing this as well.       So, another recommendation if you are dealing with cash often is to get yourself some currency detection pens and a black light to check the bills for hidden logos. A quick search online will give you an idea of what to look for in the currency your country uses. Here is one more story about counterfeit money.      If this is not enough to make you feel a bit uncomfortable, then you need to read them again. But what you can do is simply learn how to inspect bills for authenticity. Again, get yourself a handheld black light, a currency marker and anything else that applies to your country's currency and you can likely protect yourself against this. If the person buying the Bitcoins off of you seems nervous, or like they are in a hurry to get away, then take greater caution with this buyer. Always try to find buyers with good feedback (although this is not perfect), possibly ask for ID if you would feel more comfortable, and bring a friend with you, but do not make it obvious that you brought a friend with you. Getting scammed, robbed or ripped off sucks, and you need to do whatever you can to avoid it happening to you.","Going to keep it short and simple. I live in a major metropolitan city, and do a lot of business of craigslist. Meet in person, public location, inspect the item, hand cash and be on my way. I'm sure I have 25+ transactions, never been scammed.Today, I saw someone include just as a footnote ""I also accept bitcoins"". Not ""I only accept bitcoins"" or ""plz send bitcoins i mail"" just a little footnote that they are fine with it.Contacted, mentioned purchasing in cash, that was fine, and at the end decided to do it in bitcoins. Brought my laptop, public wifi, took a seat at a McDonalds. Inspected the headphones - Perfect condition, as described, everything was looking good.He hands me a paper cutout with a wallet address, I key it into blockchain, he is looking at the address on screen. I confirm the price (80 USD, was .8xxbtc), he says good, I hit send, the little blockchain beep plays over the speakers.He casually stands up, has the headphones, and walks away. I stand up pretty quick, and shout after to him, accusing him of theft. He says a quick comment around the lines of ""If you can't pay the price don't waste my time, I said $80"" and walks out.I contemplate chasing after him, calling the police, or fuck maybe getting some public attention, then I realized I didn't have a leg to stand on.Cameras would show a guy sitting down at a table, showing me headphones, me inspecting them, then playing on a computer for a bit, with him walking off. I attempt to accuse him of theft, he probably didn't even have $80 in his wallet, nothing would show me handing him cash, and the worst part, as I sat there with a mixture of adrenaline, rage and frustration - is that It was impossible for me to get that money back.Can you imagine trying to talk to the police about this? So yeah officer, I sent him bitcoins, a virtually currency for this craigslist transaction, and then he walks off - Sir, do you have any proof of this? Well, he gave me this address of random letters, but I swear it's his, but it isn't there anymore, it's gone to a mixing service where it gets pu-You get the point. I have a decently hard time explaining bitcoins to my eager, willing to learn friends. I can't imagine trying to explain it to an officer who thinks I just tried to give someone WoW gold for headphones.So, is there any safety precaution out there I didn't take, or should you just keep BTC and Craigslist as far apart as possible?Thanks for reading the rant. Sorry for the wall of text. I guess I just kinda needed to get it out there.http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b89wm/i_just_got_robbed_blind_of_bitcoins_in_person_im/;   A dangerous new scamming trend? Â£15,000 too closeSo it appears that unfortunately scammers have changed their tactics. I have been advised by police not to disclose the username or details of the person concerned until their investigation is complete but I am ok to disclose the story as a warning to others. Today I went to meet a buyer who was looking for Â£15,000 worth of bitcoins and wanted to pay in cash but this particular user had a good buyer history so although cautious I agreed to meet him in London in a place I knew there would be CCTV and security for my own safety. Arriving there today in a public place, all went fine initially from chatting with him but when I pulled out a quick form to comply with AML's he seemed very uncomfortable which although I didn't show it, it sent alarm bells ringing in my head as he kind of covered his ID whilst in terrible handwriting filled out the form and done a completely unreadable signature looking nothing like the name. At this point, I was very tempted to call the deal off simply because my gut instinct was really telling me to back out of this but he brought up he had to withdraw another Â£200 from his bank and so I asked him what bank he was with, which was Nationwide, which I am too, so I went with him to the branch with the cash and forms etc in my bag and said I would just sit in the branch since it had air conditioning and was only 5 stores away. In my head at this point, I was trying to get into the branch and see if I could overhear the name he was withdrawing from and also to see if he actually owned the card he had in his hand so I could match the details up with what was on the form.Upon arrival at the branch, he handed his card over and the bank teller gave everything a quick glance and asked him for further ID and a security check so whilst he done that, I thought I would ask the teller next to him who was free if they could put it on their cash counting machine and showed all the relevant documentation. The cash went behind the counter when she agreed and put it straight on the machine without even looking at the documents surprisingly. Immediately as this happened, the male buying the bitcoins said to me âWhat are you doing?â looking terrified and visibly sweating and shaking and I was absolutely certain something was very wrong at this point and before I could turn to the cashier and ask her to keep hold of the documents & cash and call security and the police for me (I was planning to write it on the piece of paper in my hand to be subtle), I heard a loud beeping sound from behind the desk which was the cash machine, rejecting every note in the pile because they were counterfeit notes, Â£15,000 worth of them. As you can imagine, we had 3 security guards onto us in seconds and police arrived only 2 minutes later and as myself and the other male sat there in handcuffs, the police began to ask questions to me and the other male was taken into another room inside the branch.Fortunately this day I had my CSV dumps of recent transactions, a letter from my HMRC communications recently as per my other post and also a bank statement to verify the recent transactions, plus copies of the emails I had exchanged with the male concerned as I bring them to every meeting in my bag for reference purposes if anything arises. Soon enough, having went back to the original place we met and reviewing CCTV footage of the whole thing, I was released but they kept everything in my bag, all the money of course and frozen my accounts whilst they investigate which I complied with voluntarily. The male who passed the counterfeit notes has been taken to the police station and will be in court tomorrow and I was advised by the Inspector he will probably be referred to the crown court on the matter and is being held in custody until his trial.The bank and police were both present for this and the bank strongly recommended I be careful in future and transactions that large can be run through the bank if need be and they can be the third party to sign it and check everything out for Â£35, which will completely cover me for the AML's over Â£10,000 and the buyer doesn't need to go on the bank records but the bank will verify the ID is real for me in some branches too. Whilst I was there I also was given a 10 pack of pens to check notes with for future deals and police have asked me to cease trading until this case is resolved and be prepared to be asked to come to court to present testimony if required.Again I can't name and shame the individual due to a police request, but for what it is worth, that is the story and lesson I have learned from today and despite the many big deals I have done in the past and the many shady characters, this one has really rattled me up.https://localbitcoins.com/forums/#!/regional/uk#a-dangerous-new-scamming-tr;I occasionally trade bitcoins via localbitcoins.com, to ensure that I have a good feel for the liquidity of the market and the ability to exit at will. I've never had any problems before.Last week, I responded to a request to buy $500 worth of bitcoin, via a local buyer here in San Francisco.Nothing unusual about the meet, or the buyer, other than the fact that he wanted to find a contact for regular and higher amount buys. I think he was trying to get me to increase the amount.Anyhow, I had funded $500 in bitcoins, in escrow with localbitcoins.com and we sat down to do the trade. He gave me 25 x $20 bills, which I counted. The bills felt a bit stiff, like brand new bills from an ATM. I looked at them carefully (or so I thought) and they seemed real. I pocketed the money and moved on.Fast forward three days later, I go out with a friend. Just before leaving the house, I grab a few $20s and put them in my wallet. At the first bar I paid for a drink, the bartender cam running out 5 min later into the bar area to find me. He showed me the bill I had given him, said ""this is fake, it fell apart when it got wet"". True enough, the bill had not held up to water like a normal bill. I showed him the other money I had on me and he confirmed it was all fake, except for one $20 I had from before. So I paid for my drink with the real money and left.For those wondering, the bills are indistinguishable from real $20s unless you know exactly what to look for. The smell and texture are slightly off. The most important clue is that the iridescent ""20"" on the side that changes from red-green to black-green depending on the angle you look at it. On the fake bills it does not change color.For my next bitcoin sale, I will be carrying a UV light and pen and will be more careful in scrutiny of the bills. As always, I will only meet in public and I am never unarmed, but now I also have counterfeit detection gear.Seller Beware - Counterfeit money being passed to bitcoin sellers in San FranciscoEdit: I will be writing an article about this for letstalkbitcoin.com and will provide links to detection tips and products to help with detection. Will also provide a more detailed story and pictures of the notes. Standby a few days for that...Edit 2: I will be reviewing the following products against these counterfeit notes, in an upcoming article for letstalkbitcoin.com:    Dri-mark and sharpie brand pens    UV light + magnifying combos    Magnetic testershttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nj88k/i_was_given_counterfeit_20_bills_in_exchange_for/"
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.40","2014-02-06T08:59:59","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," This post is going to talk about something that has been commonly discussed on the forums recently. How can I hide my tor usage from my ISP ?     People are more worried about hiding their tor usage from their ISP, than hiding it from a VPN. There seems to be a back and forth debate about whether using a VPN will or will not protect you. Whether or not the VPN can be convinced to log  your connection, and so forth. A few of my previous posts regarding LulzSec and the YardBird pedophile rings have shown that those who rely on VPNs to protect them are historically known to end up in jail. Even our friend we were recently introduced to, The Grugq says, TOR -> VPN is ok, but VPN -> TOR, go to jail.      In my previous posts about VPN -> TOR and TOR -> VPN, I tried to remain neutral in that you should be able to make your own decisions about how you wish to protect yourself. But just remember, at the end of the day, nobody is going to go to jail for you. If you simply want to hide the fact that you are using tor from your ISP, then we have other options than a VPN. We have bridges, and several different pluggable transports. What are these, and how can we use them in Tails?      The first thing we are going to do is get some bridges. Let us do this before we configure Tails to use bridges, because once Tails is in bridge mode, we will not be able to connect to tor without working bridges. So the first thing we want to do is visit the following webpage.  https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges     Enter the impossibly difficult captcha, and click ""I am human"", and you should get a list of bridges that look like this. These are actual bridges pulled from the tor bridges page.      These bridges are publicly available on the Tor Project website, so they may or not may be the best choice to use, but they are a good start. Another option is to send an email to  bridges@bridges.torproject.org with a message in the body saying ""get bridges"" without the quotes. This will only work if sent from a Gmail account or Yahoo, unfortunately. If you want to use this, set up the email account using tor and you will receive a list of around 3 bridges shortly thereafter.  Save them somewhere you can use them the next time you boot up Tails, or write them down.        Ok, so now we have our bridges. How do we use bridges in Tails? This is an option we need to activate when we boot up Tails. To activate the bridge mode, we will be adding the  bridge boot option to the boot menu. The boot menu is the first screen to appear when Tails starts. It is the black screen that says Boot Tails and gives you two options. 1. Live, 2. Live (Fail Safe). When you are on this screen, press Tab and a list of boot options will appear in the form of text at the bottom of the screen. To add a new boot option, add a Space then type ""bridge"" without the quotes and press enter. You have now activated bridge mode.     Once Tails boots up completely, you will get a warning that you have entered bridge mode and not to delete the default IP address in there, which is 127.0.0.1:*. This is advice we will follow, so just click OK and the settings window for tor will pop up. At this point you need to add your bridges. So you are going to take the three bridges you got, and enter the IP address and the port. If we were going to use the example above this is what we would enter.      For each bridge you add, type it in the available text box where it says ""Add A Bridge"" and then click the green + button to add that bridge. You will need to add one bridge at a time. Once you are finished adding your bridges, you can click OK. At this point, your yellow tor onion icon in the top right should turn green shortly after and you will be connected to the tor network using a bridge. Again, since these bridges are less likely to be known by your ISP, they are less likely to know that you are using tor when you use bridges.      You may wish to look up your bridge before you use it however. Maybe you want to find out where your bridge is located, maybe you want to see who is hosting the bridge, and you can do this by looking for a IP look up service online, by doing a search and typing in the IP address. The three listed above are located in the following locations.      And with that, you can decide which bridge would be a better choice for you to use. I suggest however, that you go and get new bridges and do not use the ones I listed above for obvious reasons that they are now linked to Silk Road users by me posting them on this forum. I should note that the way bridges hide the fact that you are using tor from your ISP, is that you are connected to an IP address that is likely not known to your ISP to be affiliated with tor entry nodes.      While bridges are a good idea, unfortunately they may not be enough. According to Jacob Applebaum, (a tor developer) bridge traffic is still vulnerable to something called DPI (deep packet inspection) to identify internet traffic flows by protocol, in other words they can tell you are using tor by analyzing the traffic. While tor uses bridge relays to get around a censor that blocks by IP address, the censor can use DPI to recognize and filter tor traffic flows even when they connect to unexpected IP addresses. This is less likely to be done by your ISP, and more likely to be done by the NSA, or other oppresive governments like in China and Iran, so you can choose if this is an issue for you.      Pluggable transports are a more new, but less talked about technology being implemented by tor to disguise the fact that you are using tor to your ISP and other censors. As mentioned above, it attempts to transform your tor traffic into innocent looking traffic that would hopefully be indistinguishable from normal web browsing traffic. Currently the most popular pluggable transports are obfuscated bridges. Obfuscation by definition, is the hiding of the intended meaning in communication, making communication confusing, wilfully ambiguous, and harder to interpret. Obfuscated bridges actually transform the traffic to look like random packets of data. Obfuscated bridges currently have 2 protocols.    1. obfs22. obfs3     Obfs2 (The Twobfuscator) is talked about at length at the following official page.  https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs2/obfs2-protocol-spec.txt     But for the laymans out there, basically obfs2 uses a protocol that disguises your traffic to look like random data, whereas tor has a more distinct structure to it. However, it should be noted in the case of obfs2, that if an attacker sniffs the initial handshake between your computer and the obfuscated bridge, they could get the encryption key used to disguise your traffic and use it to decrypt the disguised traffic which would reveal it as tor traffic. They would not be able to decrypt your tor traffic, but they would be able to see you are using tor. This is not likely something your ISP would do, but it may be something law enforcement or the NSA would do. So if you are only worried about your ISP, then obfs2 would likely suffice.     Obfs3 (The Threebfuscator) is talked about at length at the following official page.  https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt     Obfs3 uses a very similar protocol to disguise your traffic as obfs2, however it uses a more advanced method of an initial handshake called the Diffie Hellman key exchange. They however found some vulnerabilities in the protocol and had to go a step further and customize the Diffie Hellman key exchange to make it an even more robust method of establishing that initial handshake. Using obfs3 would be a better bet to disguise your traffic if your adversary is the NSA or other law enforcement.      So how do you get these obfuscated bridges? They are not as easy to get, but they can be obtained from tor through email. However, you need to request those bridges specifically to get them. You need to use a Gmail or Yahoo account and send an email to bridges@bridges.torproject.org and enter in the body of the email ""transport obfs2"" without the quotes, and for obfs3, simply enter ""transport obfs3"". Please note that you can only send one request to tor per email, every 3 hours. Which one you should use, is entirely your choice, I am just giving you the information necessary to make an informed choice. Enter them in this format so that Tails knows which protocol to use.     obfs3 83.212.101.2:42782    obfs2 70.182.182.109:54542     tor also provides a few obfuscated bridges on their home page which you can use as well, and I will list them below. If you send a request to tor and get a response containing bridges without obfs2 or obsf3 at the beginning of the lines, then these are normal bridges, not obfuscated, and they are likely to be out of obfuscated bridges at the moment. You will have to try again another day. So if you get a response with bridges that are without obfs2 or 3 at the beginning of each line, please again, be aware these are normal bridges, unlike the ones below.     obfs3 83.212.101.2:42782    obfs3 83.212.101.2:443    obfs3 169.229.59.74:31493    obfs3 169.229.59.75:46328    obfs3 209.141.36.236:45496    obfs3 208.79.90.242:35658    obfs3 109.105.109.163:38980    obfs3 109.105.109.163:47779    obfs2 83.212.100.216:47870    obfs2 83.212.96.182:46602    obfs2 70.182.182.109:54542    obfs2 128.31.0.34:1051    obfs2 83.212.101.2:45235        I have a feeling that some of you reading this will be inclined to go out and get yourself some obfs3 bridges right away, because you think they are the best choice out there for staying anonymous. And right now they have the potential of being what you hope for in that regard, except for one huge flaw. The number of obfs3 bridges is small. Last report I read put it at around 40 bridges running obfs3, and obfs2 was around 200. So while obfs3 is the most secure option out there, its limited number of available bridges would pool you into a smaller group of people making connections to the 40 available bridges and may not provide any more anonymity for you. tor is in depserate need of more obfs2 and obfs3 bridges at this time and these factors should be taken into account when using obfuscated bridges.     One of the solutions to this shortage problem, is to run your own obfuscated bridge. I am not going to go into it, but if you are interested in doing this, you should visit the following page to set up an obfuscated proxy, or better yet, purchase a few VPS and set them up as obfs2 or obfs3 proxies. One of the best things about doing it this way, is that you can configure it (with the instructions provided) to be a private obfuscated bridge, and therefore tor will not give it out to the public. You can then connect to your own private obfs3 bridge. You can also use a friend's computer, or use a server that you know is secure. But again, make sure that you trust the computer you are using, otherwise it is no more secure than a VPN.      Another possible solution to the lack of obfuscated bridges may be another pluggable transport option, something called a  flash proxy. This is brand new and not perfectly implemented yet, and please be aware that this is basically still in beta. When thinking about a flash proxy, think about the characteristics of a flash,  quick and short lived. This protocol was developed by a tor developer who attended Stanford University, and the idea is that the IP addresses used are changed faster than a censoring agency can detect, track, and block them. This method is similar to using normal bridges, in that, it hides the fact you are connecting to IP addresses known to be related to tor, including when the bridge's IP addresses listed by tor are discovered by your ISP or law enforcement.  This does not however, hide the fact you are using tor if somebody is analyzing your traffic using DPI (deep packet inspection).      The main benefit to this option is that the proxies are run by many people all over the world. They are run when random internet users visit a webpage with a specific plugin that turns their browser into a proxy as long as they are on that page. You are basically using somebody else's connection through their browser to connect to a tor relay. You are only using 1 active connection at any time, but you have around 5 established connections to different proxies in case your active connection drops off, then you can start using another proxy in its place. Below is another explanation of how this process works.      I know this might be a bit complicated, but you really do not need to understand how it works to benefit from it. You also might be asking about somebody just blocking your ability to connect with the facilitator (the supplier of the proxies). But, the way you actually connect to the facilitator is in a very special way that tor has designed, and this is built into the flash proxy pluggable transport. This explanation is just for your comfort, not to help you make it work.      Two questions you should be asking. 1) Can I trust the proxies, and/or facilitator? 2) How do I use this?     Well, the facilitator is chosen and currently only run by tor, so you can take that at face value. As far as the proxies go, the proxies themselves may or may not be trustworthy, and this is the risk you run every time you use tor. Your bridges that you use may be compromised, your entry nodes, your exit nodes, every single possible hop along your way to the internet can be compromised at any given time. Luckily, even if the proxy is compromised and logging your traffic, they are only going to be able to see encrypted tor traffic. And as I mentioned above, anybody who visits a webpage with a specific plugin on it, becomes a flash proxy as long as they are on that site. This means, some people will be a flash proxy without their knowledge, and others will be flash proxies because they want to be one. The idea behind this is to have multiple users, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of flash proxies available at all times to increase the number of possible IP addresses you rotate between to keep your ISP and possibly the NSA guessing.     So do you use this?  It actually currently is not supported in Tails. But it can be used with Tor Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle outside of Tails. You can get it at the following page and it will run on your normal operating system, whether it is Windows, MAC, or Linux. Get the package at the following page.  https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en#download     Next follow the following tutorial, which is pretty straight forward and has pictures of exactly what you need to do, and will probably do a better job than I would at explaining how to set it up.  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto     Essentially it comes down to, enable port forwarding for port 9000, add ""bridge flashproxy 0.0.1.0:1"" without the quotes, to your torrc, and leave everything else alone unless you need to use a different port, which is unlikely. You may need to make an exception in your firewall for the flashproxy plugin if it asks you. As long as you are using the Tor Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle, it should be pretty easy to get this feature working. But until Tails adds support for it, this is the only option you have if you want to use flash proxy bridges.      Ok, so you have a lot of information right now and maybe are left a bit confused, but read over this one a few times and try to extract as much out of it as possible at once. Try setting up normal bridges, then try doing the obfuscated bridges, and once you get those working, then maybe consider doing the flash proxies if you are okay without using Tails. Tails will likely implement support for this later. Ask yourself some questions, do I just want to hide the fact that I am using tor from my ISP? Or am I hiding from somebody much bigger than that?      Consider whether it is plausible for you to run a private obfuscated proxy, or even a private bridge. Hopefully now you have enough information to make an informed decision.     Currently there are other pluggable transports currently under developed, but not yet deployed. Here is a list of upcoming projects.   ","What bridges are and when to use themWhen using Tor with Tails in its default configuration, anyone who can observe the traffic of your Internet connection (for example your Internet Service Provider and perhaps your government and law enforcement agencies) can know that you are using Tor.This may be an issue if you are in a country where the following applies:    1. Using Tor is blocked by censorship: since all connections to the Internet are forced to go through Tor, this would render Tails useless for everything except for working offline on documents, etc.    2. Using Tor is dangerous or considered suspicious: in this case starting Tails in its default configuration might get you into serious trouble.Tor bridges, also called Tor bridge relays, are alternative entry points to the Tor network that are not all listed publicly. Using a bridge makes it harder, but not impossible, for your Internet Service Provider to know that you are using Tor.https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode/index.en.html;  5.20.130.121:9001 63dd98cd106a95f707efe538e98e7a6f92d28f94  106.186.19.58:443 649027f9ea9a8e115787425430460386e14e0ffa  69.125.172.116:443 43c3a8e5594d8e62799e96dc137d695ae4bd24b2;  5.20.130.121:9001  106.186.19.58:443  69.125.172.116:443;5.20.130.121 - Country:   Lithuania106.186.19.58:443 - Country: Japan69.125.172.116:443 - Country: New Jersey, United States; Lately, censors have found ways to block Tor even when clients are using bridges. They usually do this by installing boxes in ISPs that peek at network traffic and detect Tor; when Tor is detected they block the traffic flow.To circumvent such sophisicated censorship Tor introduced obfuscated bridges. These bridges use special plugins called pluggable transports which obfuscate the traffic flow of Tor, making its detection harder.https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports;In addition to the Tor client and relay, we provide three new pieces. The Tor client contacts the facilitator to advertise that it needs a connection (proxy). The facilitator is responsible for keeping track of clients and proxies, and assigning one to another. The flash proxy polls the facilitator for client registrations, then begins a connection to the client when it gets one. The transport plugins on the client and relay broker the connection between WebSockets and plain TCP. (Diagram below)   https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/arch.png A sample session may go like this:    1. The client starts Tor and the client transport plugin program (flashproxy-client), and sends a registration to the facilitator using a secure rendezvous. The client transport plugin begins listening for a remote connection.    2. A flash proxy comes online and polls the facilitator.    3. The facilitator returns a client registration, informing the flash proxy where to connect.    4. The proxy makes an outgoing connection to the client, which is received by the client's transport plugin.    5. The proxy makes an outgoing connection to the transport plugin on the Tor relay. The proxy begins sending and receiving data between the client and relay.In other words, you end up going from your computer, to the proxy, then the proxy to the tor relay. - JRThe whole reason this is necessary is because the client cannot communicate directly with the relay. (Perhaps the censor has enumerated all the relays and blocked them by IP address.) In the above diagram, there are two arrows that cross the censor boundary; here is why we think they are justified. The initial connection from the client to the facilitator (the client registration) is a very low-bandwidth, write-only communication that ideally may happen only once during a session. A careful, slow, specialized rendezvous protocol can provide this initial communication. The connection from the flash proxy to the client is from an IP address the censor has never seen before. If it is blocked within a few minutes, that's fine; it wasn't expected to run forever anyway, and there are other proxies lined up and waiting to provide service.;The way the client registers with the facilitator, is a special rendezvous step that does not communicate directly with the facilitator, designed to be covert and very hard to block. The way this works in practice is that the flash proxy client transport plugin makes a TLS (HTTPS) connection to Gmail, and sends an encrypted email from an anonymous address (nobody@localhost) to a special facilitator registration address. The facilitator checks this mailbox periodically, decrypts the messages, and inserts the registrations they contain. The result is that anyone who can send email to a Gmail address can do rendezvous, even if the facilitator is blocked.https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyFAQ;ScrambleSuit is a pluggable transport that protects against follow-up probing attacks and is also capable of changing its network fingerprint (packet length distribution, inter-arrival times, etc.). It's part of the Obfsproxy framework. See its official page.

I have a question, I use TAILS always but I'm getting pissed off by the lack of media players on it or being able to install one on a USB. I have been playing with Knoppix another Linux live OS on a USB and its got everything from audio players to video players and Tor to PGP and usually they,ve 2-3 different PGP clients and audio players. But their Tor is an old one but you can update it and you can add different stuff like GPG4USB which I find very easy to use and for sure easier than their PGP client on tails, I think its called seahosre.  Anyway is there anyway I could use Knoppix and be as secure as tails? I'm also playing with a hardened Gentoo USB but have yet to try install PGP4USB or a media player on it, I haven't tried them on any market sites coz I'm not sure what the risks are, I've tried go to hidden wiki and TorDir and the new installed Tor worked it wasn't the old one. It uses vidalia in a separate panel so its easy to tell. If its not using your HD and on a USB with maybe truecrypt as well could it be OK to use or is there a audio player I could put on tails usb? I hate using the video player, you need to pick one file at a time not just pick a folder and let it play. Its not a big hing just wondering if any alternative to tails is any way as safe, I also tried Liberte, Jondoe and other anonymous live discs but they are fairly old and haven't been updated in months even over a year for some. So they're out, I would be really happy to have foobar and PGP4USB on tails or be able to use Knoppix or a hardened Gentoo ",""

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.40","2014-01-28T21:45:11","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," This post is meant to serve as an example of how, when cryptography and anonymity is used properly, you can evade just about anybody including the police.     By now, everyone has likely heard of someone getting locked out of their computer and being forced to pay by the attacker to have it unlocked, this is CryptoLocker. Dell SecureWorks estimates that CryptoLocker has infected 250,000 victims. The average payout is $300 each, and millions in laundered Bitcoin have been tracked and traced to the ransomware's money runners.     CryptoLocker is a ransomware trojan which targets computers running Microsoft Windows[1] and first surfaced in September 2013. A CryptoLocker attack may come from various sources; one such is disguised as a legitimate email attachment. A ZIP file attached to an email message contains an executable file with the filename and the icon disguised as a PDF file, taking advantage of Windows' default behaviour of hiding the extension from file names to disguise the real .EXE extension. When activated, the malware encrypts certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography to generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers.      The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either Bitcoin or a pre-paid voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatens to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offers to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin.     Dell SecureWorks estimates that CryptoLocker has infected 250,000 victims. The average payout is $300 each, and millions in laundered Bitcoin have been tracked and traced to the ransomware's money runners. In November 2013, the operators of CryptoLocker launched an online service which claims to allow users to decrypt their files without the CryptoLocker program, and to purchase the decryption key after the deadline expires; the process involves uploading an encrypted file to the site as a sample, and waiting for the service to find a match, which the site claims would occur within 24 hours. Once a match is found, the user can pay for the key online; if the 72-hour deadline has passed, the cost increases to 10 Bitcoin.     To date, no one has successfully defeated CryptoLocker. The Swansea, Massachusetts police department was hit in November. The officers paid CryptoLocker's ransom. Police Lt. Gregory Ryan told press that his department shelled out around $750 for two Bitcoin on November 10. One of the reasons I am posting this, is that CryptoLocker uses 2,048 RSA encryption, and if you remember in the PGP posts earlier in this thread I recommended to use 4096. Even with 2,048 bit encryption, no one has successfully defeated CryptoLocker, and this is the power of properly implemented cryptography.     And, using the proper methods of anonymity, this person or group has managed to acquire, according to research done by ZDNet, around 41,928 BTC.  http://www.zdnet.com/cryptolockers-crimewave-a-trail-of-millions-in-laundered-bitcoin-7000024579/      As you can see, properly executed cryptography and anonymity allowed this group of people acquire the Bitcoin equivalent of almost $42 million in just now 4 months at the time of this post. I am not recommending or advocating that you do this, but just giving you a perfect example of how powerful the combination of these two very important factors are in protecting anybody online when used properly.","In research for this article ZDnet traced four bitcoin addresses posted (and re-posted) in forums by multiple CryptoLocker victims, showing movement of 41,928 BTC between October 15 and December 18.Based on the current Bitcoin value of $661, the malware ninjas have moved $27,780,000 through those four addresses alone - if CryptoLocker cashes out today.If CryptoLocker's supervillans cash out when Bitcoin soars back up to $1000, like it did on November 27... Well, $41.9 million isn't bad for three months of work."

OpSec stands for Operations Security and in this context refers to people keeping themselves anonymous online. He goes by the online handle, ""The Grugq"", and Grugq has his own blog which can be found at the following webpage.       http://grugq.github.io/     It should be noted that Grugq was at one time on the payroll of the US government for finding and selling zero day exploits. If you remember the previous post about how the US federal government is the singlemost purchaser of malware in the world, well Grugq was one of those who sold malware to the government. Unfortunately for him, when he went public about it, they no longer wanted to buy malware from him because they like to maintain their own anonymity when purchasing these exploits. And here is a short biography from an online website.      Why are we talking about the Grugq? Who cares? Well, he has some of the best information on keeping yourself anonymous and maintaining privacy online and he is somebody who you should all familiarize yourselves with. He writes blog posts, and he has done video presentations at security and hacker conferences, with his most famous presentation, at least in the world of Silk Road being the one he did on OpSec. Since I know it is hard for Tails users to watch videos on YouTube, I decided to download it from YouTube and upload it to AnonFiles.com so you all can watch it. The presentation is about 1 hour long, and an essential to everyone who wishes to maintain their anonymity online. Remember, you only have to screw up once.      https://anonfiles.com/file/b6de41da8d1fca2fabf725f79d2a90df      SHA1 Sum: 1a9e6c67a527b42a05111e1b18c7a037744bb51e     MD5 Sum: b6de41da8d1fca2fabf725f79d2a90df     Once you have downloaded the file, I want you to check something called the checksum of the file. The checksum is where the contents of the entire file get plugged into a mathematical algorithm and output a specific string. You can see the two strings above. This is something you should all get into the habit of doing when possible is verifying the checksum of your files. If you remember when we talked about signature files and PGP, this is another method of verifying your downloads but not as good as the signature files. It should however, whenever provided be performed to verify your downloads when the signature file + PGP combination is not available.     Once you have downloaded the file in Tails, the first thing you should do, is move the file you downloaded to your tmp folder. In order to do this, look up at the top and click  Places -> Computer -> File System -> tmp. This is where you move the file your downloaded to, and to keep things easier, rename the file  grugq.zip and you will see why you want to do that in a second.      Next we are going to open a terminal window (like a DOS prompt) by clicking the black rectangle icon in the upper left center area of Tails. Once you have opened your terminal window, we are going to perform some Linux commands.    cd /tmp - This will change the current directory you are operating within the terminal to your tmp folder and allow you to more easily access the files in that folder.   sha1sum grugq.zip - This will perform a SHA1 checksum on the file you just downloaded, and you can see why you wanted to rename the file. It should give you the same output as the SHA1 sum listed above.    md5sum grugq.zip - This will perform an MD5 checksum on the file you just downloaded, and is another way of checking the file. SHA1 is better because it is harder produce the same output twice with different file contents using SHA1 versus MD5, but nonetheless, use both whenever possible and always check your downloaded files.     Ok, assuming your downloaded video passed the checksum test, you can be assured that the video file that I uploaded has not been tampered with, or had any malicious code injected into it. When even a single character is changed in the source code of a given file, the checksum output will be completely different. Most people think it may be off by a a few characters, but the difference is always quite large and is why performing checksums is an important way of verifying your downloads.      Since you now have a 1 hour video presentation that you all need to watch and rewatch (You can do this in Tails), I will end this post and continue with my next post from the assumption that you can completed watching this highly recommended and endorsed (by SR administrators and moderators) video on OpSec. We will start looking more into the recommendations from the Grugq. He will be an invaluable resource of information for us, and I will mainly be translating some of his posts into a more understandable format for those of you who are less technically capable and also keeping them on the Silk Road forum hidden services.          -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJS7wteAAoJEPuh6tSg81nyhyYP/0nFaWRq0GPe6/5XeMUj3yiZ 2fBaJ+7SXOMxnNXPZw9XAN5Hkpp9wPQmk8W27otuIk2N+iom8H0tJcGZi7hiMd45 Dv0NOrt/gS3bst/G37I+tPwdnWxb1pVNCS+3XnuLOo9IA7VdykU8tz6R+68kPB25 9lDguaUYVeGp2AJMezQ01LL60xQvv25TFLgiPrYD611bscVadckhSV5upXlbMW9+ WVzJG1mgY9gmUYQV6D5ErPGIvxm8cC+IVlzwgGHQPd3kq2QlmQF3XJrXqWGPXd8d ewkD6VnrU8yO6tVMCG57K1xO9a9zPYp6yN1IOe69IsRkK7g266D+cz6Idwt97/Vr 5jgu1Ook8dfFGA3Sxg+qpoARt5diWKchvmqbxRrnFdOtCAawH1+DgNcVdepi7agk zhIES1drHdIM1uQ9Wg3vegCLrU3HDpRwwyWoSZxH4kxruU7aByOH5ZdAZw9JV6Lk b5JzVjrvrhayXwiHPQnnjM50RT9jPH44PhNZCN4G7Ln2Rkb7qa/kS5sA4W2dRwXf SjtYXf+18pCp/7NL09LD+LsabZHEAa/MilWxjsAnLLIrJsnw3YbSUola/ebmnIq8 oUW20yP0fDOHdeSGVq1uLNZIadZHZtmZIGqBigPU3XAKLxYajssglAgcPxD8E4vc rkKb3PIyz1k1/JXulymR =zJvP -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ","Biography: The Grugq is an Information Security Professional who has has worked with digital forensic analysis, binary reverse engineering, rootkits, Voice over IP, telecommunications and financial security.

And they are likely giving them everything they need in order to read the emails. Therefore, you should remember that no email service should be trusted. No email service is going to go to jail for you. And if you are sending anything sensitive over email using plain text, it will likely be read eventually by somebody other than the intended recipients. This is why things such as strong PGP encryption are essential to any type of sensitive communication.     With this, it should be noted that Safe-Mail is no safer than Gmail when it comes to protecting your privacy with its centralized email service. Never trust any company with your privacy, always encrypt.","Known users of the Safe-mail web service include operators, vendors and customers of the dark webâs many drug market sites, journalists writing about the investigation into Silk Road, and BTCKing, the vendor who ran an underground anonymous Bitcoin exchange and allegedly worked with BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem to sell more than $1 million worth of Bitcoins to users of Silk Road.When I reached out to Safe-mail for comment, Amiram Ofir, Safe-mailâs President and CEO, responded in an email that the company and its employees âcertainly are not aware of any criminal activity,â adding that the company does âfollow court orders that are issued in Israel by an Israeli court. Any other law enforcement agency should contact the Israeli authorities.â Itâs worth noting, however, that Israel signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S. in 1998. An MLAT request was used to image the Silk Road web server, according to the criminal complaint of Sept. 27, 2013.Ofir told me that communications between users and the web service are SSL protected, and that information stored on the server is encrypted with user-specific keys. When asked if Safe-mail has received court orders issued by an Israeli court on behalf of a non-Israeli law enforcement agency, such as the FBI, Ofir replied with a short âYes.â My followup email, asking if Safe-mail has the ability to decrypt information without a userâs key, went unanswered."

They must have assumed that the buyer was using fraudulent funds and this shifted suspicion onto the seller as well. I do not know if this story is true, but I am tending to believe it is. Police are monitoring these transactions, so you better make sure you have a reasonable explanation as to where you obtained the Bitcoins you are trying to sell.      This next story was removed by the original poster (OP), but luckily somebody in the replies quoted the entire post and therefore I was able to grab it.      This story above, I do not know if it is true either, but it is something to think about. According to the OP, law enforcement wanted all his messages and phone numbers, obviously to try and find other people involved in money laundering and the drug trade. He was scared enough to have deleted the original post, but as I mentioned, some other people quoted it and I was able to grab it.     To summarize, the police are likely watching these Bitcoin transactions to some degree and you need to establish a buyer or seller that you can trust. Once you find a good one, stick with them, even if their rates go up. Try to search for people with established feedback, ask for ID if you want, and make sure you have nothing incriminating on you, or at your home around the time of these transactions. You never know when you could be trying to offload your BTC to a cop!","In September and October, I sold 213 BTC (gradually) to some random guy on localbitcoins. Everything went fine, each time I got the money, I sent the bitcoins. 5 days after the last transaction, I get arrested by the police. ""Where does this money come from?"" I explain about bitcoins, and tell them all I know about the random guy, I volunteer my phone to analyse my emails and check my story. Once they were sure that the guy contacted me and not the other way around, I was finally free to go. Later they told me that the money was stolen and they thought I was doing money laundering.Now after almost 3 months and a lot of back and forth with the police, they are now suggesting that I send back the money. I would gladly do that if they arrested the criminal and found out he can not repay. Right now if I send back the money, the innocent person who got his money stolen gets it back, but then I become the innocent person who got his money stolen, so that makes no sense to me.Edit: I just saw a lawyer. According to him I already won the case. But it's going to cost me some serious money in lawyer's fees... More than my cumulated profits. I take that as the cost of a great life lesson and a wake-up call.He also told me I can disclose the info that the police already knows. So here we go. I'm in Brisbane, Australia. The reason the police froze my account and not the criminal's account is that they wanted to know where the money was going. The police are regularly checking my house to make sure the criminal is not seeking revenge (he has my full address and I have 2 kids).http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1to08d/arrested_by_the_police_for_localbitcoins_business/;So, as a few of you guys know, I'm moving to another country soon enough. When I get over there I won't have access to my bank account, so a few weeks ago I decided it might be a good idea to sell some of my BTC for cash. I had done this a couple of times before and had a positive experience, so had no whims about doing it again.So I received a request from someone who wanted to buy 500euro worth of BTC in a f2f transaction. I drove down to meeting spot, met the guy, he gave me the 500euro and basically ran back to his car and drove off. I obviously found this strange, but it was an escrow tx, so I released escrow from my phone and went back to my car.On my drive back, I noticed that there was a Ford Mondeo behind me (the kind of car that is usually used by undercover police in my city). It seemed to be following me, I didn't have all my paperwork on my car in order,  so I decided to take a detour down some local back-roads and shake it.So anyways, I lost the car, drove home and thought nothing of this strange encounter.Over the next few days, I noticed strange needle marks and tiny tears in all of my mail, I also noticed a really strange parked car outside my house one day, when I walked over to it to ask them what they were doing there, they drove off at speed. I probably should've been suspicious then, but I had done nothing wrong and shrugged it off.A couple of days later, I wake up to the sound of my door being smashed in. I run down to find 5 police officers in my house. They showed me a search warrant under the misuse of drugs act. The national drugs unit were parked outside with sniffer dogs ready, they left after a few minutes though and didn't come inside with the dogs. The police told me the person I met on localbitcoins was an undercover police officer, and they had copied the registration number off of my car and got my address from it.They stripped the whole house down, turned everything upside down looking for drugs. They found 1 joint of weed and they also seized a clock which they thought was a digital scale (it wasn't) and informed me that they were going to prosecute me for intent to supply, even though I wasn't selling, and I showed them a prescription from a doctor in another country (that isn't valid here) and told them the superintendant of the local police station had informally told me that they wouldn't prosecute me for possession if it was medical use even though I was technically breaking the law. They also found padded envelopes and accused me of selling drugs through the post (a complete lie with no evidence).They then told me that if I didn't give them all the messages & phone numbers of everyone I had met to sell BTC that they were going to seize all my bitcoin miners, computers etc and have them ""analyzed"". I was about to move country in the next few days and didn't want the hassle of having to deal with this, so I told them that I had deleted all the messages (which I did) but that I would be able to get them back if they left my computers there, and that I would co-operate fully (I'm obviously not going to co-operate). They then left and I changed my flight date and basically fled the country the next day, luckily I was planning on moving in a week anyways.So, a warning to you guys, be careful doing f2f transactions or buying/selling BTC in general, even though we're not breaking the law it doesn't mean you won't get unwanted attention from the police.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=174918.msg1820363#msg1820363"

A phishing scam is when somebody sends you to a URL that looks like the real URL, but it is actually set up so that when you login, it steals your login credentials and the attacker takes over your account. In this case, take over the LocalBitcoin account and steal the Bitcoin      Luckily for the seller, he did not fall for the scam. But anybody not careful enough could fall victim to this scam.

Everything looked great at first as we signed up, got verified and then proceeded to transact with the trader. We sent our Bitcoins and where confronted with some windows which began to confuse our tester, who mistakenly confirmed the transaction, minutes after sending the Bitcoins. Our tester was not sure if they needed to click the confirmation to advise the trader that the coins where sent, so spent some time in the FAQ to find out what to do next. No information was found by our tester, who then guessed that since there was no mention of it, then it must be a trivial issue and confirmed the transaction anyway. What happened next worried out tester as the transaction was marked as closed and they had sent the Bitcoins to the trader without knowing if the fiat money would be deposited into the bank account. We waited 24 hours to confirm a cash transaction into a designated account and lo and behold, its not there.Next we proceeded to contact the trader and as of writing, we have not heard from them. We contacted Localbitcoin support and began a ticket. Shortly afterwards, we received an email from Localbitcoin support staff and explained the situation and where told that the confirmation did need to be done AFTER we confirmed the funds had been placed into our designated account by the trader.After a few emails to the support staff, we did explain that we where testing the system useability for the everyday mom and pop situation, because if Bitcoin is to be used properly, it needs to have an easy (dumbed down) system so the inexperienced user can make a trade without making mistakes like our tester did.http://mentaso.com/bitcoin-news/item/224-localbitcoins-scammed-on-our-first-test-of-the-system.html;User requested nearly $2k CAD worth of bitcoins using my localbitcoins ad.Immediately asked to move the conversation to text messaging, asked me âhow many coins I have in there (localbitcoins wallet)â then (after some dawdling and chitchat) asked me to âcheck out and read his other localbitcoins ad firstâ.Included was a URL to localbitcoinis.com with an ad url long enough I know this was copy/pasted and not a typo.A quick WHOIS reveals a domain by proxy, but some google-fu on the contact telephone number registered to the domain reveals that domains related to this phone number have been involved in other scams.http://bitcoinviews.com/scam-alert-localbitcoinis-com-scammer-contacting-localbitcoins-com-users/"

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.40","2014-02-11T18:10:49","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Here is a simple copy and paste story you should be aware of.   As you can see, the cops are watching LocalBitcoins. Laundering Bitcoins is like laundering real money. You need to have a way to justify where the money came from. Back in the day, the Mafia had small legitimate businesses it would run that it could claim as an income, and they might fix the numbers a bit and say they made more money than they really did. This would provide an income they could use as a reason for having money. If you are somebody who does not work, and only sell drugs on Silk Road, and are trying to cash out your coins, then I hope you have a legitimate reason for holding that many BItcoins, otherwise you could end up like these two guys.","State authorities in Florida on Thursday announced criminal charges targeting three men who allegedly ran illegal businesses moving large amounts of cash in and out of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.Working in conjunction with the Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs office, undercover officers and agents from the U.S. Secret Serviceâs Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via localbitcoins.com, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed âMichelhack.â According to this userâs profile, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in todayâs value), and a 99 percent positive âfeedbackâ score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to 30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Floridaâs law against unlicensed money transmitters â which prohibits âcurrency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month periodâ â and Floridaâs anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is Pascal Reid, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone â which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.âThe biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because itâs always hard to buy Bitcoins,â Weaver said. âThe reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible â namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.âOne very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins â BitInstant â was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.Itâs still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhackâs profile suggests little more than arbitrage â that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But itâs notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation â 28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola â is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. âIâd expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets,â such as Silk Road, Weaver said. âIf you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.âNews of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht â the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions â a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIâs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer.https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/"

Each hop is just your data being sent through a tor relay. Traffic within tor is encrypted. Hidden services are actually hosted within the tor network and therefore communications stay encrypted. Therefore if a relay node is comprised the only information available will be the source (not necessarily you it as it's more likely to be the previous tor relay) and the destination. However, in the case of accessing a clear net site, the final tor relay node will act as what is known as the exit node. If the original data you sent is not encrypted, for example a standard http site then once this data leaves the exit node it will be in its unencrypted state again. This means if the tor relay that is used an exit node is comprised then all unencrypted data is susceptible to being captured (in an interpretable state).  I think any tor relay node can be an exit node and this is chosen during your connection to the tor circuit (on each connection [and probably when you use the new identity button]).

"The Hub Forums","EvilGrin","4410.0","2014-07-24T03:10:53","onion vs clearnet tracing","General Discussion/Security","I read that in this article:http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-23/tor-anonymity-software-vs-dot-the-national-security-agency#p4  Considering the irony of posting a clearnet link in a thread about it being unsafe to click clearnet links, I guess I'll post the relevant information.  In technical terms, Tor provides privacy by separating identity from routing online. In a normal session online, youâre browsing from your computer or a router thatâs assigned its own IP address. Every request you send out carries that address, and information is returned there. When you use Tor, instead of your chat message, or the URL you type going directly to its destination, itâs routed through Torâs network of volunteer nodes, moving through at least three of them, before exiting the network and proceeding to the endpoint. The website that receives it doesnât know what your IP address is, nor does any point in the Tor circuit except for the entry relay. For most users, a Tor session does not feel different from going on the Web with the Firefox browser. But all the winding through relays does slow things down, and the default settings disable some functions for security reasonsâincluding plugins that allow videosâbut they can be turned back on.  Syverson and other researchers have written voluminously about Torâs weaknesses. The network operates within the wider Web, and the way users behave and configure their computers outside Tor is one of the biggest sources of insecurity. One way the NSA found to get around Torâs software and spy on users was an attack called âEgotisticalGiraffe,â exploiting a vulnerability in the Firefox browser.  Another approach was to try to reconstruct the encrypted path to find the identity of a Tor user by monitoring relays, according to the âTor Stinksâ presentation. Success with this approach was ânegligible,â because all three hops in the circuit had to be part of the set NSA could monitor, and the agency had access to few of them.  There is a deeper layer of Tor, where information is hosted, called hidden services. These sites are tagged with the extension â.onionâ and can only be accessed using Tor.  A regular Internet userâs traffic goes through at least three hops; hidden services traffic goes through at least six. Iranian activists during the Green Movement protests in 2009 maintained blogs and websites using hidden services, according to Lewman. The drug bazaar Silk Road operated as a hidden service. You couldnât find and use Silk Road with a Google searchâits IP address was hidden from users. Those who wanted to buy drugs on the site had to use Tor as their browser, type in Silk Roadâs .onion address, and use Bitcoins to pay for their purchases.   I recommend reading the whole article though. It discusses why the NSA is having such a hard time 'catching' anyone who uses Tor.",""

They post big CLEARNET!!! warnings when visiting a clearnet site is neither more nor less dangerous than visiting a hidden service. Both can serve malicious scripts to try to deanonymize you. Freedom Hosting was a hidden service that served malicious Javascript when it was taken over by LE (Google ""torsploit""). Disabling scripts or using a firewall/transparent proxy or an anonymizing middle box will protect you equally from clearnet sites and hidden services.   They only need to watch the first and last nodes to deanonymize visitors to clearnet sites and hidden services. Since connections to clearnet sites involve exit nodes which rotate every 10 minutes, but connections to hidden services involve entry guards on both ends, which persist for 1-2 months, traffic analysis is theoretically harder against visitors of hidden services.  However, when the Five Eyes and collaborating intelligence agancies watch most of the Tor network all the time, I'm not sure that having entry guards on both ends is helpful.

"The Hub Forums","Brahman","5889.0","2014-12-02T11:17:23","Why is Agora the #1 Site for Drugs?","Start Here/For Beginners","In my opinion Agora is the most reliable market due to the number of trusted vendors that choose to work only with it. Admittedly, recent events have eroded some of the confidence in the market but Agora has proven time and again to be trustworthy and secure. The down time is not a big concern as long as itÃ¢â¬â¢s translated in security and the low key presence of staff is reassuring. Every time I have contacted support I have been answered within a few hours.  Evolution seems to have exploded recently due to an influx of Silk Road users who had a strong antipathy towards Agora - many completely mind set on Agora being the ""enemy"". Admittedly, Evolution layout and filter capabilities are superior to Agora but their focus on contraband and fraud is a big drawback for me - as it is the fact that both allow the sale of guns and fire arms. I wish this would be banned completely, not only from the dark web but from the world in general.  But the growth of Evolution and its product focus puts it on the spotlight and I agree that it is likely higher on the priority list of LE everywhere.  Agora is still the market which instils the most confidence, although this days I think of dark web markets as places where I can find a trusted supplier with whom one can forge an out-of-market relationship and deal directly with. There are plenty of trusted vendors that have proven themselves throughout the years and with whom one can avoid all the risks inherent to the markets. ",""

Because of its better security, it withstood while most of the competition got nailed by LE. Evo has recently been growing rapidly because it has an even better setup and is online more. They too run a very sophisticated (probably the most advanced) and secure operation and were also able to remain while the main competition got seized/shut down.

"The Hub Forums","El Presidente","3405.0","2014-05-20T17:41:07","""RT: TOR is NOT PRISM Proof""","General Discussion/Security","In our humble opinion the article contains no new information but is a welcome reminder to keep guards up.  Our take is that  - The majority of external surveillance directed at Tor is focused on exit traffic on to the Internet (at this point in time) - Private companies and LEO are deploying exit and guard nodes for the purposes of threat intelligence gathering and user activity correlation - Private companies and LEO are heavily indexing and trawling searchable hidden services for what they deem 'relevant content'.  - Private companies and LEO are now starting to deploy more hidden services for the purposes of intelligence gathering and direct disruption - If the Justice Dept have their way then within 12 months there will be far greater use of de-anonymization attacks using Jscript, flash etc and that this will be injected directly onto malicious hidden services  On the third point in particular we know for a fact that the UK are doing this with regard to identity documents and passports, the ATF/FBI (or companies acting on there behalf) are doing this with firearms. We have visibility of search terms used on a number of hidden services and can tell you 100% that this is the case. It would be interesting to compare notes with other site operators on some of these automated search terms. We played some games before January and without going into details can say that one or more individuals are following up manually by investigating changes to search results for certain terms. What we cannot say is who they are but we suspect LEO or contractors operating on their behalf.   However the latter two points should be of the most concern to DNM users.  We are currently watching an interesting sequence playing out with some recently deployed hidden service hosted aggregation services (no names at this stage) - they appear to have created 3 seemingly unconnected services (one of which is clearnet) and are now slowly bringing 2 of them together. It may just be a group with a desire to make money or strongly influence the markets but it may be a more destructive force. Time will tell. If anyone wants to discuss offline you know where to find us...  Some of the exposures in Tor are less applicable for users who only access Hidden Services (which includes most DNM activities) but for those who access clearnet the risks are usually greater. Sticking with Tails or whonix and ensuring that your endpoints are reasonably hardened (which is generally true with either of those systems) is the best you can do really along with minimizing clear-net access - or at least doing it with a different browser.  We believe that disruption rather than detection is the currently favored approach for the adversaries of the DNM and we believe they are probably putting what they need to in place to bring about disruption to DNM (lets face it - if the last 6 months are anything to go by they won't need to try too hard).

The problem is he makes it sound like the article had ""revelations"" about Tor safety and presented it as somehow ""authoritative"".  He couldn't be more wrong.  The original article is here (http://rt.com/news/159396-nsa-tor-ineffective-microsoft/) and the whole thing is nothing more than a report on the ramblings of a ""Microsoft security guru"" named Andy Malone who seems to know even less about Tor than he does about security. Microsoft security is an oxymoron - you know Microsoft, right?

Hmm, I wonder how many of the NSA's cutely named computer exploits in their ""Tailored Access Operations"" catalog were using that ""bug"".  If DeepDotWeb had even half a brain he would know any claims by a Microsoft drone about another browser's security is laughable.","http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/05/18/rt-tor-prism-proof/;âTor leaks do occur through third-party apps and add-ons, like Flash.

(Step 4) Create some prophetic text into a file for a test encryption: echo 'The collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of USD' > file.txt  (Step 5) Attempt to encrypt this file gpg -a --output output.enc --recipient SOMEONE --encrypt file.txt  (Step 6) Now decrypt the output.enc file to see which keys it's  been encrypted with:  $ gpg --decrypt output.enc You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@domain.com>"" 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30 (main key ID 7EAEB199)  gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30       ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@domain.com>""  What you don't see is a line telling you it's been encrypted with the key for SOMENAME. You should see, but don't see, a line that says: gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 772EA66A, created 2014-03-30  And therein lies the rub ... (or bug, if you prefer)  What gpg appears to be doing, is selecting the first match for the --recipient argument that appears in the public keyring. It doesn't select _all_ keys that match, it seems to select only  the first key that matches.   (Step 7 ) Clean up and restore your original keyrings) mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.SOMENAME mv ~/.gnupg.orig ~/.gnupg     So what can you do to prevent this happening to you. 1.  don't use short key id names like:  THE or EEN or ING etc. Or anything else that is likely be a subset of a larger name. 2.  specify your encryption recipients using the key IDs  not the names on the keys eg: gpg -a --output output.enc --recipient 772EA66A --encrypt file.txt  Have a nice day ... and be happy  playground :-)",""

"The Hub Forums","playground","2509.0","2014-03-31T17:59:07","Be careful how you name your gpg keys","General Discussion/Security"," Thank you Axolotl :-)  I liked the ""quoting"" solution that you suggested, so i decided to put it  to the test.  Below you will find my experiments to test that solution and also the ""Email Address"" solution.  1. Testing the quoting solution. -------------------------------- The ""Quoting"" solution suggests that the substring matching problem when processing the --recipient argument is solved by simply putting the key name in quotes, as shown below:  $ gpg -a -o output.enc -r ""SOMEONE"" -e file.txt  We can now attempt to decrypt the message to see which keys were used when it was encrypted:  $ gpg --decrypt output.enc  You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>"" 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30 (main key ID 7EAEB199)  gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30       ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>"" collapse of the Petro dollar: collapse of USD  Still no mention of this file being encrypted with SOMEONE's key.  The quoting solution, at least with my version of gpg, doesn't work.  My version is: 1.4.16  (but note: that's on cygwin, not linux) Perhaps it works with other versions.  2. Testing the Email Address solution. -------------------------------------- The 'Email Address' solution suggests that the way to  avoid the substring matching problem is to specify the key by specifying the email address presented on the key. For example: $ gpg -a -o output.enc -r SOMEONE@domain.com -e file.txt  where the available public keys are: $ gpg --list-keys  pub   1024R/7EAEB199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08] uid                  myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion> sub   1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]  pub   1024R/8A0290BA 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09] uid                  SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com> sub   1024R/6022F39B 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]  This _does_ solve the problem:  $ gpg -d output.enc gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 6022F39B, created 2014-03-31       ""SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com>"" gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available  This is the expected response. :-) This message has not been encrypted with the myName public key. I can not decrypt this message because it's been encrypted with the public key for SOMEONE and i don't have the private key for SOMEONE.   So we have two solutions to the substring matching problem when the --recipient argument is processed: 1)  specify the recipient public key with the key ID, eg: 6022F39B 2)  specify the recipient public key with the full email address, eg: SOMEONE@domain.com  Any other solutions.. or perspectives on this problem, are warmly welcomed.

"The Hub Forums","playground","2509.0","2014-04-01T22:57:46","Be careful how you name your gpg keys","General Discussion/Security"," hi firelight,  Thanks for your suggestions, i learned something. :-)  I imagined by 'interactively' you were alluding to  some kind of ncurses (or similar) interface that might present options to select from, for recipients, for files to encrypt etc.  I now understand that by 'interactively' you're referring  to executing the gpg command without the -r/--recipient argument. This will cause gpg to prompt the user for a list of recipients It's the difference between: gpg -a -o output.enc -r {KEYID|EMAIL} -e file.txt and gpg -a -o output.enc -e file.txt   Thanks for this, it was a useful suggestion.  Here is a demonstration of this suggestion in action:  I found it most useful to first get a listing of all  keys that matched the  key names/keyids/email address of the keys i wished to use to encrypt the message:   You can get a subset listing of all your public keys by specifying the key names/ids/emails on the command line: eg:   $ gpg --list-keys myName SOMEONE pub   1024R/7EAEB199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08] uid                  myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion> sub   1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]  pub   1024R/8A0290BA 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09] uid                  SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com> sub   1024R/6022F39B 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]  Now when i execute the encryption command without the --recipient  argument i can simply copy and paste the email addresses  or keyids from the listing above.  Notice that gpg prompts you for multiple recipients. After you specify each recipient gpg lists all the public keys that will be used to encrypt the message.   To terminate the entry of recipient keys, just press return. eg:  $ gpg -a -o output.enc -e file.txt You did not specify a user ID. (you may use ""-r"")  Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: 7EAEB199  Current recipients: 1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30 ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>""  Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: 8A0290BA  Current recipients: 1024R/6022F39B 2014-03-31 ""SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com>"" 1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30 ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>""  Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line:  And to check which keys were used in the encryption:  $ gpg -d output.enc You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>"" 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30 (main key ID 7EAEB199)  gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 6022F39B, created 2014-03-31       ""SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com>"" gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30       ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>"" collapse of the Petro dollar: collapse of USD  So it's absolutely true, using gpg ""interactively"",  by omitting the --recipient argument on the command line,  allows you to _see_ which keys are being used to encrypt a message. Possibly this is the best-practice usage for encrypting msgs.  Good work firelight :-) When i'm able to.. i will award you some karma points.  have a nice day .. and be happy.  playground.  PS.. how have you ended up with so many karma points already ?

"The Hub Forums","PlunderinPete","6134.0","2014-12-22T05:16:10","Pete's Protect Yourself Series - Episode 1 - Foundation First","General Discussion/Security","Okay, so I started with the Intro/Broad topic which turned out great (I think). NI and I had a good discussion regarding building your own system such as Arch Linux and what happens when they implement something like systemd.   Anyway, like building a house, you have to have your foundation first. Proper opsec and security is not 100% technological. It is a lifestyle. Tor has some good starter tips here: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning. Basic, common sense stuff that won't allow someone to isolate your traffic and trace it back to you. For example, don't log into Facebook or Google while on Tor. Facebook has a .onion but it isn't to there to keep you secure. This is out of scope of this post though.  Where do you start? There are so many options? Windows+Tor Browser Bundle? Tails OS? Whonix? Qubes OS? Build Your Own? I think that it all really depends on how paranoid you are and how far you want to take it. As you secure yourself more, convenience and functionality decline.   Tails OS https://tails.boum.org/ Tails OS is a Debian-based OS that pushes all of it's traffic through Tor. It runs from a USB/DVD so, from a local forensics standpoint, it is ""amnesic."" It also has a pretty awesome feature where it wipes the RAM upon shutdown. Overall, without getting super technical, it is a Linux OS with a transparent proxy and some other things already configured.  Whonix https://www.whonix.org Whonix is another Debian-based operating system that takes on a ""security by isolation"" philosophy. Whonix consists of two parts; Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-workstation. Basically, you work in your workstation and all the traffic is pushed through the gateway which is in turn pushing through Tor. The idea is by isolation, malware infections do not have the same impact as they would have in a non-isolated OS.   QubesOS/TorVM https://qubes-os.org/wiki/UserDoc/TorVM QubesOS takes the same philosophy of security by isolation, however, it isolates each application into it's own VM. One of those VMs is similar to the whonix-gateway, where all data is pushed through and torifies traffic. The big advantage to QubesOS is that if Firefox were to be exploited, then the malware should not be able to break out of that Firefox container.  A custom-built OS So, this is my personal preference. I use fully-encrypted Arch Linux on a USB and a transparent proxy to push everything through Tor. I don't really have a reason for this except for being partial to Arch linux. I just love Arch over a Debian-based OS and it is personal preference. I also do more with my machine than just browse Onionland so it is more convenient to just run my proxy script, start the proxy, verify I'm in Onionland and move forward.  So which one do you choose? Well, what are you worried about/protecting yourself from?  If you're worried about local forensics and being raided by the FBI, hard drive images, etc., I'd go with Tails OS. It is ""amnesic"" by design and is probably your best bet. I have also had my eyes opened to Liberte Linux but have not had much time to check it out.  If you're concerned about being exploited by some vulnerability, go with QubesOS's TorVM. It's security by isolation design will provide the best security. As mentioned before, if the browser VM is popped, it will be pretty difficult to exploit and hop to another VM and break out of that browser VM.  If you're worried about ISP snooping and leaking protocol-level information, go w/ Whonix. It's workstation/gateway setup coupled with boot time randomization and ""secure network time synchronization"" will provide protection from ISP snooping.  Personally, I prefer the TailsOS route. Pushing everything through Tor and ""blending in"" with the crowd is, in my opinion, the best way to stay hidden among the rest of the crowd. Think, in the hood, on the corner, there a group of people wearing white shirts and jeans. A crime is committed and the cops put over the radio that the suspect is wearing a white t-shirt and jeans. The cops arrive on scene and there are 10 people that all look the same. Which one is the suspect? That is the major advantage to Tails and to Tor as a whole. The more people that look-alike, the harder it is to isolate an individual user's traffic.     For those interested in there own custom OS, here are my iptables.rules and relevant torrc configs. https://defuse.ca/b/t20KjWZu   To go more in depth, check out here: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others  ",""

For example, if you think thatIsolateDestPort will keep SSH separate from HTTP, you're not right:it's trivial for a hostile webpage to include an img tag whose URLspecifies port 22, which would make HTTP and SSH requests get over thesame port.Isolating by destination address is also ridiculously expensive andslow if you're doing typical HTTP usage, or some other protocol wherea single logical request turns into requests to many different hosts.Mike's got a more sophisticated approach here that he's aiming to doin TB; he can link to the best explanation of it better than I canfind out which one is best."

I just wasn't that pretty and I didn't understand security like I now do. So I set about configuring the ultimate hardened Debian-based system. I spent hours and hours working on it. Learning Linux essentially from scratch.  I got a list of the most commonly recorded User Agent data, and wrote a script that would randomly select the user agent data to pass when executing wget and curl.  I got obsessed with clock skew and started making inroads into creating a Stratum 2 NTP server using a Raspberry Pi and GPS module. Then I thought -- hey, what if instead of having perfect time, I throw in some clock skew on purpose?? (https://github.com/ransford/skewmask)  I wrote all these scripts to randomize MAC address (at level of udev, not after login), and check that my IP wasn't leaking by checking my IP at random times using an IP echo API. I taught myself everything I could about how Tor works. I wrote and re-wrote my iptables. I sat for hours packet sniffing to confirm that I wasn't getting any IP or DNS leaks. On the matter of DNS leaks, what if I had my own DNS caching server so as to reduce DNS lookups??? The list goes on.  My point: As clever as I've convinced myself that I am.I am not a security expert. I will never be a security expert. Why try to re-invent the wheel, when there is a team of eggheads who are sitting around working on this very issue, about which they're experts.

(http://cdn.hiconsumption.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Homer-Car-LEGO-Set-1.jpg)That's what Whonix feels like. A mish-mash of ideas from someone afflicted with  ADHD/psychostimulant abuse who has sat down and thought about things for too long, and burned a hole in his head from thinking about every permutation of every scenario and just driven himself crazy. Don't get me wrong -- I think the dude is fucking awesome, and if I wasn't using TAILS I'd certainly be used Whonix. But you read his detailed blueprint of Whonix, and you will get the impression that this man is a little unhinged. (Whether in a good way or a bad way, I'm not entirely clear)."

However, not everybody at the NSA is on board with this strategy. Tor developer Andrew Lewman says even as flaws in Tor are rooted out by the NSA and British counterpart GCHQ, other agents from the two organizations leak those flaws directly to the developers, so they can be fixed quickly. He said, ""You have to think about the type of people who would be able to do this and have the expertise and time to read Tor source code from scratch for hours, for weeks, for months, and find and elucidate these super-subtle bugs or other things that they probably don't get to see in most commercial software."" Lewman estimates the Tor Project receives these reports on a monthly basis. He also spoke about how a growing amount of users will affect Tor. He suggests a massive company like Google or Facebook will eventually have to take up the task of making Tor scale up to millions of users.",""

Without getting into too much detail, our operation is decentralized - the business end of receiving and selling our product to our clientele is in one part of the U.S. (A), and the buying of BTC, connecting with vendors, and ordering of the product on various markets takes place in another (B).  A sends cash deposits through teller transactions to B, B buys untraceable BTC and places orders, orders are shipped to A.  As some of you may know, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are required to report transactions of more than $10,000 in a currency transaction report (CTR).  We like to avoid this.  Our orders are usually more than $10,000.  Thus, a hypothetical transaction to get the money to B, without triggering a CTR or even worse a suspicious acitivy report (SAR), generally involves depositing around $4,000 into one account, and $9,000 into an unrelated ""burn"" account that we never use again.  We find friends in the B area that we know, burn their account once with a big deposit, collect the cash from them, and never use their account again.  The problem is, we've burned so many accounts that we are now having a hard time finding people still able and willing to do it.  We can't go back to accounts we've already burned because we believe a repeat of the large cash deposits into the same account just under $10,000 may trigger a SAR due to structuring fears of the bank.  My question: is there any way to get around this that we have not thought of yet?  Any and all comments or questions are appreciated.  Let me know what you guys think.  Kainan",""

Forming and llc is not the worst way to go. It depends on several factors. 1. The type of business, if you say your selling stuffed animals and your company makes several hundred thousand that year it will raise red flags. You will want to pose as a tech company, etc.  2. Taxes are not a bad thing in the slightest. If you structure your llc in the right way such as ABC LLC taxed as a S-Corp. You can legally generate yourself payroll and that taxation while your company is taxed at a different rate. One advantage is if you keep your personal salary under the federal poverty line you can capitlize on obamacare. lol. Seriously though if you have that much money to move your gonna want to pay taxes and look like a nice law abiding citizen. (Think the long game) 3. Never fall for the out of state llc scam like the nevada corporation. Forming out of state or country is one of the quickest ways to get audited, etc.  4. Vary how you take payments and make deposits. In the us you can make cash deposits, use prepaid visa/mastercards (available at any drugstore) to take credit card payments, and use the occassional money order. Once these ""funds"" start flowing in, pay your taxes quarterly and it make your business structure look even more sound.  I could continue this list on and on, but with a little research and effort you can lower your risk exposure immensly.  If all your interested in is large btc purchases, you will have to be more creative. Don't link those purchases to you business account. Depending on your location you can find may buyers on local btc willing to take cash or accept bank deposits.

We take communication as granted since there are so many ways to do it, but more than often it gets problematic, when some forms become unavailable for example (like the Hub right now), some are highly monitored by LE, and some require too much technical know how to set up to be convenient.  I personally always had the problem that I communicate safely with my darknet contacts, but with most friends I have to talk on the phone or communicate through whatsapp or facebook.  Thats why I have created JitJat. Its a very simple web instant messenger to communicate safely with your contacts. I have made it super easy to use and accessible via Tor at jitjatxmemcaaadp.onion (recommended) or Clearnet (SSL encrypted) at jitjat.org  There is a chat- and a messaging mode, both with various features implemented. messaging-mode doesnt require scripting, so you can safely use it with noscript. Messages are deleted automatically after 14 days, although you can always nuke a conversation or delete single messages, too. When you do this, you have the choice between deleting only your side of the conversation or the whole thing.  To make it real safe form of communication, it is completely open source. Since you would still have to trust me as the operator with your information, you can cut the middleman and install it on your own PHP/MySQL server. Very easy and takes only 5 minutes. Either if you want to use it internal for your crew/team/friends/family or run a public copy of JitJat, its easy to do and gives you a convenient way to exchange information. no special device, platform or software required, just a browser.  I would love to see one or more reputable members of the community hosting a copy of JitJat, so that users who dont want to install it themselves can chose between different and more trustworthy operators (*glances at el presidente*)  If you dont run it on your own server you can and should still encrypt with PGP if you want to have 100% safety that only the recipient reads the message.  You can download the source on our site, if you find a bug or security hole, please report!  enjoy secure and convenient free speech    regards  JitJat   Links: http://jitjatxmemcaaadp.onion https://jitjat.org",""

Yes its crazy how many people get busted because on evidence collected through wiretaps, SMS and probably more and more other services like facebook and whatsapp. I was amazed that I couldn't find a single product that enabled simple and safe webbased communication, and I really wished there was, to not have to code it myself. There already are some similar services like jitjat, but none of them publish their code, so you always need to trust a 3rd party. So I used torchat a lot (and Jitsy as Skype-alternative), but that only works for some contacts, some of my friends dont even have a computer and only use their smartphones.. And even those I forced to install Torchat, still call you because they are not at their computer at the moment..and using codewords haha i feel you with the pizza thing.. Its mostly not even relevant what you talk about, but how you talk. It always starts pretty good with something like ""hey dude everything worked out sending the party invitations?"", or ""did you manage to bang that hot chick yesterday, the one with the green skirt?"", but then one tries to sqeeze more info into it, like price, amount, location, time, whatever.. lots of ""eehhhhmmmmm...you know""s, while the story becomes more and more bullshit. After you hang up, in 80% of cases you think daamn only a full retard wouldn't know that we were talking about drugs after listening to this.  Like you said, you can't really start early enough taking your private conversations off the hotspots.

Czech programmer Rudolf Marek reported the holes in the Trinity, Richland, Kaveri, and Kabini silicon series ahead of a disclosure at the Chaos Communications Congress.  AMD's System Management Unit (SMU) firmware code within x86 processors did not run adequate checks prior to execution, allowing Marek to inject his own commands.  Marek told attendees to ask their mainboard vendors to push the fixed AGESA to BIOSes.  ""Tell your vendors for a fixed AGESA (AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture),"" Marek said during the talk aimed at encouraging more of the low-level security analysis.  ""This is the only way to push vendors to update BIOSes for older platforms.""  Marek did not describe particular attack scenarios created by the lack of a protected code along with further firmware errors.  It took roughly a year to fix the flaws in an exchange he described as ""responsible and helpful"".",""

The issue affects to all Linux process even if they are not using shared libraries (statically compiled).  The problem appears because some mmapped objects (VDSO, libraries, etc.) are poorly randomized in an attempt to avoid cache aliasing penalties for AMD Bulldozer (Family 15h) processors.  Affected systems have reduced the mmapped files entropy by eight.      After we found (and fixed) this weakness, we found a detailed white paper about this issue (Shared Level 1 instruction cache performance on AMD family 15h CPUs). Several workarounds were proposed, but none of them solved the problem in the way our proposal does.      Our solution (see below) is not a workaround, but a solution that effectively avoids cache conflicts and does not jeopardizes ASLR entropy. The complexity, both in the number of lines of code and the timing overhead, of our proposed solution is negligible; that is, it does not have trade-offs AFAWK. ",""

"The Hub Forums","The real Jigsaw Puzzle","8987.0","2015-05-21T22:04:12","Using bitcoin w/Blockchain.info tor site - OPsec question","Start Here/For Beginners","    Never store any coins in any account on a website, regardless of whether it's a Tor hidden service on the Tor network or a website on the clearnet. Doing so will leave the door open for an attacker / rogue admin  to potentially lock out existing account holders and gain access to any accounts containing coins or perhaps even take the server/s permanently off-line before disappearing forever with all the coins stored in all user accounts.  You should only be using any Bitcoin Wallets you have over Tor. Never open or complete a btc transaction from your Wallet over the clearnet for obvious reasons and never send coins from a Wallet used over Tor to another Wallet used on the clearnet. If you want to have both, make sure they always remain independent of each other, one Wallet for all your DM activities (say an Electrum Wallet) and one for use only on the clearnet (say a Multibit Wallet).  If you want to minimize the risk of being flagged through Blockchain Analysis or alike, then you should ONLY be using an onion mixer to tumble your coins and then sending them from there to various btc addresses stored in a few different personal Wallets. Never tumble your coins using a coin mixer found on the clearnet. If you're concerned about your anonymity, you should only be using coin mixers on the Tor network set up as a Tor hidden service (with a .onion to end the URL). It's also a good idea to use jump Wallets (additional personal Wallets) to move varying amounts of coins around to each one using a new btc address for each and every transaction. You should acquire the desktop bitcoin client/s you intend to use over the Tor network and acquire new btc addresses when needed over Tor as well. Basically, keep everything associated with your DM Wallet/s over the Tor network.    ","so, currently all my BTC is somewhat traceable to myself.its all been bought via circle.its been tumbled through sharedcoin with blockchainand it now resides in a wallet that has no transactions coming from it in electrummy question is, would it be just as safe in blockchain's tor site with a newly created account, after sending it through helix to one of the addresses in that account? if not what's my best option to keep myself anonymous with bitcoin after purchasing it legitimately?

There is NO technology now, nor is there ever likely to be one, that will allow child abusers on the Darknet to be singled out from other users. You simply cannot strip away the protection the software affords the child abusers, without allowing everyone else to be similarly stripped of its protection, e.g. drug users, political dissidents, and whistleblowers, to name just a few.   Anyone who states otherwise is deluded. The technology, for better or worse, is neutral -- either  everyone is protected, or  no one is protected -- it's a zero-sum game.   Frankly, I am sick to death of seeing this argument -- I've seen it made time and again, for more than two decades now. It is no exaggeration to state that almost every single invasion of privacy, and almost every abrogation of civil liberties in my lifetime have all been justified with the cry of, ""We must protect the children!""  This is why we have ended-up living in a surveillance state -- and it is people like  you who have led the charge in setting it up.   Almost invariably, this argument is put forward by clueless people -- like you -- with absolutely zero understanding of the technology. The world just doesn't work this way, however much you might wish it to.   I have spent a damn good chunk of my life fighting against the establishment of a surveillance state, while fucking clueless fools like yourself have swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the line put forth by the powers that be, that this is necessary to ""protect the children.""

As if you Americans have the right to rename a sport that existed long before your American footballbut anyway that is a argument that i dont need to start.lol So believe it or not today is the first time i have read about Deep Internet and learnt of this whole new exsitance. Obviously once i read a bit into this topic , it made total sence and can see the inportant service the Deep Web provides specially until the UK and USA are spying on it very own people. After learning of how to join this new world after some reading i have come across this site which i find very interesting and looking forward to getting to know this new type of internet usage.Obviously i have heard about sites like SR1 ect and my real life friends have used its functions so i knew of these types of sites however did not know about the Deep Web and Tor and there purpose, so i have a lot to learn and find things out that.Now i have put some thought into why people need to use these funtions such as Tor , Deep Web ,encryption i am a big fan of this even tho im a new user specially when it comes to getting to grips with being able to buy certain recreational substances in the knowledge that i wud be reasonably safe in doing this along with many other things i am yet to find out ,however when i was intially reading into this subject Deep space and it stated several reasons why people wud be using these functions it stated first Child Porn , Drug dealing ect ect. Now i would just like to read other peoples opinion about yes we all see a need for the use of these functions and one of the main reasons is to avoid identifaction by the Authourities but there is one user i really do feel should not be able to access these functions and use the deep web to avoid detection and this 1 group is people who  view Child Porn , or access Forums regarding child porn. I feel these people have no right to hide anywhere in this world be in real or virtual so is there nothing to be done about these dirty bread of humans ?? Yes i agree with that Authourities wud not just stop at identifying just these individuals. what do you guys think about the Deep Web community working together in the harrasment and terrorisation of these real scum bags that prey upon the very young , these people really do not deserve to be able to function in this enviroment.

Im lufc1983, for anyone who is not European lufc stands for Leeds United Football club. For all the Yanks yes it is a football club however i believe you call it Soccer. As if you Americans have the right to rename a sport that existed long before your American footballbut anyway that is a argument that i dont need to start.lol  So believe it or not today is the first time i have read about Deep Internet and learnt of this whole new exsitance. Obviously once i read a bit into this topic , it made total sence and can see the inportant service the Deep Web provides specially until the UK and USA are spying on it very own people. After learning of how to join this new world after some reading i have come across this site which i find very interesting and looking forward to getting to know this new type of internet usage.  Obviously i have heard about sites like SR1 ect and my real life friends have used its functions so i knew of these types of sites however did not know about the Deep Web and Tor and there purpose, so i have a lot to learn and find things out that.  Now i have put some thought into why people need to use these funtions such as Tor , Deep Web ,encryption i am a big fan of this even tho im a new user specially when it comes to getting to grips with being able to buy certain recreational substances in the knowledge that i wud be reasonably safe in doing this along with many other things i am yet to find out ,however when i was intially reading into this subject Deep space and it stated several reasons why people wud be using these functions it stated first Child Porn , Drug dealing ect ect. Now i would just like to read other peoples opinion about yes we all see a need for the use of these functions and one of the main reasons is to avoid identifaction by the Authourities but there is one user i really do feel should not be able to access these functions and use the deep web to avoid detection and this 1 group is people who  view Child Porn , or access Forums regarding child porn. I feel these people have no right to hide anywhere in this world be in real or virtual so is there nothing to be done about these dirty bread of humans ?? Yes i agree with that Authourities wud not just stop at identifying just these individuals. what do you guys think about the Deep Web community working together in the harrasment and terrorisation of these real scum bags that prey upon the very young , these people really do not deserve to be able to function in this enviroment. Be interested to know other people opinions.",""

Check out this thread too, some good basic stuff in it:  http://thehub7gqe43miyc.onion/index.php?topic=5647.0   I agree if there were ways to attack those sites then we would be doing the world a favor by attacking them.  For the most part folks around here are like you, looking for some fun of the recreational sort.  Why can't this sub group of self-proclaimed computer experts, try and identify these bad people you asked?  To mount an attack and identify mission is way beyond the skill level of 99.9% of dark denizens.  The <1% who might have the skills to do this, have better things to do with their time, that no doubt involve making money.  Perhaps you can study up on Tor/PGP/Tails, find their weaknesses, then become a Dark Web Robinhood who takes evil doers down with the greatest of ease.  A nice costume would be useful when you go out in public, perhaps a pirate one with a sword and everything.  For now however, we need to let LEO do their jobs.  But then if full time professionals can't do it, who can?  Maybe when North Korea, or whoever, is done with Sony they can direct their attention to this?  Why no good things happening from the former Eastern Block countries?  They only do bad things, no good coming out of that region.    American football is eventually going to go the way of the buffolo, then you can retain exclusive rights to the name.  Both games are silly, but yours is more of a natural adaptation of human movement, while American football is all about being ready to commit assault, both on and off the field, when required.    cherrio chap,  cs ",""

It SOUNDS interesting, but I'll believe it when i see it in action... I avoid Reddit like the plague and have never had an account, so I don't know how helpful that has been to users.  And the main problem with .onion forums is that there is always a question of the motivation/impartiality of individual admins and mods, or that of the entire team, and questions of ""censorship"" (i hate using that term, it's a misuse of the word unless it's being done by authorities or governing bodies, IMO, but that's the buzzword) always arise.   Any given group of people can start out on a project with the best of intentions but I think it's impossible for admins to organize a project like a forum, and keep it under control, without eventually developing an ""us vs. them"" mentality that angers users and can produce dissent and eventually potentially fracture. It's human nature.  The pros of the model you outlined are unachievable without the major con of anarchy and disinformation, but I'd appreciate the option to have the information and decide for myself if it's reliable, than to have the information redacted or purposely omitted because it doesn't serve the admins' agenda/s or conform to community rules.

"The Hub Forums","DrOz","5745.0","2014-11-01T08:02:26","Oz authorities sieze $9.6 million bitcoins allegedly from silk road dealer","Start Here/For Beginners","For those of us afraid of clear net and thanking nz4867  The Sydney Morning Herald   Australian authorities sitting on $9.6 million worth of bitcoins confiscated from Silk Road drug dealer    Australian authorities could be sitting on a bitcoin gold mine.  Australian authorities could be sitting on a bitcoin gold mine.  Authorities may soon reap millions of dollars by selling more than 24,500 bitcoins confiscated from a Melbourne drug dealer.  This was the first time the state of Victoria had seized electronic currency from criminals.   The currency's volatility has seen the value of the seized asset jump from $700,000 at the time of the man's arrest to nearly $32 million shortly after it was confiscated. Today the bitcoins were worth about $9.6 million.  The assets are subject to a restraining order and would soon be forfeited to the Department of Justice and sold at auction, but not before the appeal period ends in 28 days. Proceeds would go to the state's consolidated funds.   Richard Pollard, 32, of Warrandyte, was sentenced in the County Court in Melbourne on Friday to 11 years' jail after pleading guilty to commercial trafficking. He received a non-parole period of seven years four months and has already served 325 days in custody.   Police were monitoring Pollard in late 2012 when they executed a search warrant on two properties and found a variety of drugs, computer equipment and post satchels.  The court heard Pollard trafficked 2.8 kilograms of MDMA, 876 grams of ice, 44 grams of cocaine, 30 grams of ketamine, as well as fentanyl, methorphan and poisons between August and December, 2012. Police also found 61 cannabis plants.   Police also found express post envelopes used to distribute drugs and printouts from online trading site Silk Road showing names and addresses for drug orders, according to court documents. Pollard used multiple post office boxes under different names to conceal the volume of mail he received and sent, the court heard.  Judge Paul Lacava told Pollard: ""You were operating a relatively large and sophisticated drug-trafficking business ... You used the website Silk Road to acquire and on sell a variety of drugs, which you delivered mainly by using express post.  ""The system of drug trafficking you engaged in meant you operated an effective one-stop shop where a variety of drugs could be purchased online.""   While Pollard used ice and cannabis himself, the trafficking was to make money, not satisfy his own habit, the judge noted.     When Victoria Police searched his property in December 2012, they found $58,000 in cash. They later found three electronic wallets containing 24,518 bitcoins., which were confiscated in 2013.  The court was told that while on bail, Pollard was stopped for a random licence check and police found money in his car, including $4000 in his sock, and drug paraphernalia. A further search of his property found he was trafficking again.  Bitcoins were created in 2008 as an electronic currency for online trading. Coins are ""mined"" by using computers to solve mathematical problems, with about 13.4 million coins in circulation.  Bitcoins have been popular with drug dealers for their anonymity but are also used to pay for legitimate purchases online and offline.  In late 2013, the FBI arrested Silk Road's alleged founder and called it ""the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the internet today"". US authorities also confiscated 144,000 bitcoins from the man.   Pollard trained in IT and previously worked for a company called Wireless IP that reportedly owed him $70,000 when it collapsed. He set up his own IT company but was often owed money by customers. Justice Lacava noted Pollard's intelligence and talent with computers was misused for trafficking, but could be used ""to good effect"" when he was released.   The confiscated property would go to the Asset Confiscation Operations office in the Victoria Department of Justice. A spokesman said seized property was sold at public auction and proceeds directed to the state's consolidated fund.  ",""

I was like a kid in a candy store, having access to the highest quality of drugs and better yet, have my new best friend the post man deliver it right to me..  Anyway, after the bust I lost a lot of coin (my own fault for thinking Silkroad was near invincible) then started to vend on sheep, which as we all know closed shortly afterwards. After that I decided to cut my losses and run with my profits, it's been an interesting ride. For the most part I've taken a back seat and watched the scene evolve. It's certainly been very interesting and I think we're only at the beginning of this revolution.

"The Hub Forums","axa","764.0","2014-02-16T15:20:56","Axa's Guide to Secure Email Providers","General Discussion/Security","If you want to keep your email private here are some recommendations for free or very low cost services:  Use an anonymizing service that provides email if possible, if not you can use a traditional SMTP mail service that does not log IP addresses and whose mail servers are outside of your country. If you are using a mail service with servers located in the USA  never leave messages on the server because there is a high risk that the server could be compromised or seized.  Even outside of the USA it is good practice to always download all your mail messages to your computer using a local mail client. Protecting your mail client by encrypting your computer is also recommended.  If you are using a traditional mail service that allows connection by Tor consider using the FoxyProxy addon for Thunderbird to route your email through the Tor network or use Claws Mail in TAILS.   Anonymizing Services with Integrated Email  Bitmessage - highly secure messaging service that can function like email by using the Bitmessage E-Mail Gateway.  i2p (http://geti2p.net) - the second largest anonymizing network after Tor. Free to use and provides anonymous email either through an SMTP server or an internal, distributed email system called i2p-Bote. The i2p SMTP server run by Postman can be reached through a webmail interface called 'Susimail' or an email client like Claws Mail.   All messages on i2p-Bote are encrypted end to end removing the need to use PGP or other privacy software, and since the user can configure variable hop relays i2p-Bote is arguably the most anonymous email service available, however, email can only be sent within the i2p network between users of i2p-Bote.   Freenet (https://freenetproject.org/index.html) - anonymous network with decentralized data storage and anonymous Freemail (https://freenetproject.org/freemail.html) email plugin. While Freenet provides an http interface for browsing freesites, unlike JonDo and i2p a proxy to browse the web is not available. Like i2p-Bote, Freemail only works within the Freenet network.   Mail Servers Outside of USA -  Tor Hidden Service  Lelantos Mail - a new mail service on Tor hidden services with servers outside of the USA. A lifetime subscription is less than $35 in bitcoin. Use PGP for sensitive email. Similar to Tormail, you can be reached from the web at your <username@lelantos.org> email address. Lelantos Mail has several advanced features that can be enabled in the member control panel:  1. Automatic encryption of any clear text emails you receive using your PGP public key 2. Mail aliases 3. Temporary email acounts  Find Lelantos mail on Tor at  lelantoss7bcnwbv.onion. Lelantos Mail is  highly recommended.   Lelantos Mail can also be accessed over Tor using IMAP/POP3 using Thunderbird. For a tutorial with screenshots you can visit http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,2091.0.html  SIGAINT - free mail service on Tor. Javascript not required and webmail only. URL is http://sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion/    Mail Servers Located in USA  Riseup.net (https://riseup.net/en) - a collective based in the US that provides online communication tools for people and groups working on liberatory social change. Requires application and approval or invitation codes. Free email service does not log IP's or embed IP addresses in mail headers. Also provides a free VPN for members. You can also access your Riseup.net mail on Tor without javascript at https://zsolxunfmbfuq7wf.onion/  VFEMail (https://www.vfemail.net/) - free and paid email provider with the option to use a Netherlands server. Gold ($30/year) and Platinum ($50/year) automatically obfuscate metadata, a valuable option.   Riseup.net and VFEMail are the  only recommended US based email providers.    Mail Servers Located in Europe  Tutanota (https://tutanota.de) - free, end-to-end encrypted email service with servers in Germany.   ProtonMail (https://protonmail.ch/) - free, end-to-end encrypted email service based in Switzerland.  Autistici/Inventati (http://www.autistici.org/en/index.html) - A/I is an Italian collective similar to riseup.net that is dedicated to providing a full range of free, privacy aware internet services including webhosting and email. No logging of IP addresses. Requires application and approval.  OpenMailBox.org (https://www.openmailbox.org/) - free email service based in France accessible by webmail, IMAP or POP3. Strips IP from mail headers and does not log. The volume on the server that stores messages is encrypted with LUKS.   Bitmessage E-Mail Gateway (https://bitmessage.ch/) - Bitmessage E-Mail Gateway is a free service located in Switzerland that allows users to send and receive email to/from bitmessage addresses and also from/to any other email address. You do not need an email address to register and can access your mail through a webmail interface, Thunderbird or Outlook. Can be accessed over Tor. Also provides innovative 'localhost access' feature that allows you to hide your IP from the server and sent emails. Using the localhost access option you can connnect anonymously to the server without using Tor or a VPN, giving you anonymous email cheap and easy right from your browser.  Vmail.me (https://www.vmail.me/en/) - Vmail.me is a free service located in France offering webmail with IMAP and POP3 access. IPs are stripped from mail headers but the service does keep IP logs.   Mail Servers Located in Middle East  Privat DE Mail (http://mail.privatdemail.net/en/) - free EU based email service that does not log IP addresses with mail servers in Egypt. Email to Israel is blocked, which also blocks mail to and from Safe-Mail.net. Open registration. Uses a self-signed SSL certificate which can cause browser errors; install the 'Skip Cert Error' add-on to correct in Firefox or register with Internet Explorer instead.   If using Firefox once the 'Skip Cert Error' add-on is installed go to Add-ons Manager in Firefox > Extensions > Skip Cert Error 0.3.4 then click on 'Options' and add mail.privatdemail.net to the domain whitelist and you should be able to register.    Promising Start Ups  Other privacy aware email startups in order they will probably be available:  Startmail - https://beta.startmail.com  Mailpile - http://www.mailpile.is/  LEAP Encryption Access Project - https://leap.se/en/services/email   TAILS  TAILS (https://tails.boum.org/) is a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a USB drive and routes all your traffic through the Tor network. Because of the way TAILS is designed it leaves no traces of your internet activity on the host computer. Free i2p mail is integrated into TAILS as is the Claws Mail client. TAILS makes it easy to use free i2p mail. You can also setup Claws Mail to access your Lelantos Mail, Privat DE Mail or any other mail account accepting connection by Tor like Riseup.net.    Always use PGP encryption for privacy  Using an email service that will not reveal your location in the mail headers provides anonymity but not privacy! For sensitive email, you should always encrypt your email with PGP unless you are using i2p-Bote or Bitmessage, both of which transparently encrypt your email for you.   If you would also like to investigate paid privacy conscious email services further a good resource is http://prxbx.com/email/ ",""

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","764.0","2014-04-01T17:45:23","Axa's Guide to Secure Email Providers","General Discussion/Security"," Plenty.    That's  precisely the problem. Safe-Mail has become a point of concentration, a one stop shopping site for those involved in potentially illegal activities, and for LEA as well..   Forbes even went so far as to write an article at the end of January about Safe-Mail, wherein they were described as the email provider of choice for the Darknet. A Forbes reporter even interviewed the CEO, who stated he was unaware of the problem -- until Forbes called, that is.   As far as Safe-Mail's CEO is concerned, this is both a personal as well as professional black eye. In any other context, I'm sure they would be absolutely  delighted to be the subject of a Forbes article. Not so much in this case, I suspect.   Now they will have the eyes of LEA on them, and in order to show they have not been turning a blind eye to illegal activity, of necessity, they must begin to crack down. Emails will be scrutinized as never before.    Encrypt  sensitive?  You should be encrypting  everything.   Also bear in mind that, while  you can control what you do, you cannot control what others do.

In other words, one should eat quite a few meals over a period of a year or more with someone before you trust him.  It is appropriate that this anonymous proverb forms the opening for this issue of ""Being Sovereign"" because one of our anonymous colleagues has done quite a bit of research on Safe-mail.net, the Israel-based ""encrypted"" e-mail provider. We wanted to share some of this information for your benefit. By the way, we've eaten a peck of salt with our anonymous colleague, and have other reasons to trust him.  Safe-mail.net is one of several e-mail services that offer to provide secure, encrypted, web-based e-mail service to the general public. The idea seems to be that people who would not be willing to take the fairly short amount of time to learn to use PGP encryption would be able to secure their e-mail by trusting a third party, in this case the folks at Safe-mail.net.  We reject that idea on several grounds. First, the company that provides Internet services for hosting the Safe-mail.net system is Barak.net.il, based on our review of the domain registration for Safe-mail.net. Barak.net.il is one of three companies with a license from the Israeli government for providing similar Internet services, according to the English-language version of their web site, as we understand it. Perhaps it is merely a coincidence that Ehud Barak was once head of the Israeli Defense Forces intelligence branch.  Second, the Safe-mail.net system is ""an IP trap."" Our anonymous friend indicates that your IP address is linked to your e-mail account. The user agreement indicates that it is a violation of the user agreement to employ an anonymous proxy or otherwise attempt to mask your true IP address. So, while no identifying information (name, address, phone) is requested when you set up an account, your IP address may be traced to your physical location, or at least to your specific Internet Service Provider, even if dynamic IP addresses are used. Thus, your location and possibly your identity would be exposed. Also, IP addresses are not stripped from e-mails you send from your Safe-mail account, so your recipients see this information. (And, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)  Third, Safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. They make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. This vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. Given that Barak.net.il is licensed by the Israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the Israeli government could command that the data from all Safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of Barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, Safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. Then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the Israeli government.  We found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with Safe-mail.net. An investigation of Israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by Israeli authorities. So, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the Israeli government. We don't have anything against the Israeli government that we don't also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.  It is widely known that Israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. For example, if a USA government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a Safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the Israeli government.  While it is impossible to know whether or not Safe-mail.net accounts are ""Mossad-transparent"" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the Mossad, or others within the Israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. We have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that Safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.  There is always free meat in a bear trap. Be careful.""  ******************** Whether you believe this post is up to you, the point is why take a chance?

Quote from: Fugazzi on April 01, 2014, 01:14:10 pmlots of vendors seem to use it as their ""if market is down"" contact address?  That's precisely the problem. Safe-Mail has become a point of concentration, a one stop shopping site for those involved in potentially illegal activities, and for LEA as well.. Forbes even went so far as to write an article at the end of January about Safe-Mail, wherein they were described as the email provider of choice for the Darknet. A Forbes reporter even interviewed the CEO, who stated he was unaware of the problem -- until Forbes called, that is. As far as Safe-Mail's CEO is concerned, this is both a personal as well as professional black eye. In any other context, I'm sure they would be absolutely delighted to be the subject of a Forbes article. Not so much in this case, I suspect. Now they will have the eyes of LEA on them, and in order to show they have not been turning a blind eye to illegal activity, of necessity, they must begin to crack down. Emails will be scrutinized as never before.

"The Hub Forums","axa","764.0","2014-02-16T15:20:56","Axa's Guide to Secure Email Providers","General Discussion/Security","If you want to keep your email private here are some recommendations for free or very low cost services:  Use an anonymizing service that provides email if possible, if not you can use a traditional SMTP mail service that does not log IP addresses and whose mail servers are outside of your country. If you are using a mail service with servers located in the USA  never leave messages on the server because there is a high risk that the server could be compromised or seized.  Even outside of the USA it is good practice to always download all your mail messages to your computer using a local mail client. Protecting your mail client by encrypting your computer is also recommended.  If you are using a traditional mail service that allows connection by Tor consider using the FoxyProxy addon for Thunderbird to route your email through the Tor network or use Claws Mail in TAILS.   Anonymizing Services with Integrated Email  Bitmessage - highly secure messaging service that can function like email by using the Bitmessage E-Mail Gateway.  i2p (http://geti2p.net) - the second largest anonymizing network after Tor. Free to use and provides anonymous email either through an SMTP server or an internal, distributed email system called i2p-Bote. The i2p SMTP server run by Postman can be reached through a webmail interface called 'Susimail' or an email client like Claws Mail.   All messages on i2p-Bote are encrypted end to end removing the need to use PGP or other privacy software, and since the user can configure variable hop relays i2p-Bote is arguably the most anonymous email service available, however, email can only be sent within the i2p network between users of i2p-Bote.   Freenet (https://freenetproject.org/index.html) - anonymous network with decentralized data storage and anonymous Freemail (https://freenetproject.org/freemail.html) email plugin. While Freenet provides an http interface for browsing freesites, unlike JonDo and i2p a proxy to browse the web is not available. Like i2p-Bote, Freemail only works within the Freenet network.   Mail Servers Outside of USA -  Tor Hidden Service  Lelantos Mail - a new mail service on Tor hidden services with servers outside of the USA. A lifetime subscription is less than $35 in bitcoin. Use PGP for sensitive email. Similar to Tormail, you can be reached from the web at your <username@lelantos.org> email address. Lelantos Mail has several advanced features that can be enabled in the member control panel:  1. Automatic encryption of any clear text emails you receive using your PGP public key 2. Mail aliases 3. Temporary email acounts  Find Lelantos mail on Tor at  lelantoss7bcnwbv.onion. Lelantos Mail is  highly recommended.   Lelantos Mail can also be accessed over Tor using IMAP/POP3 using Thunderbird. For a tutorial with screenshots you can visit http://i4rx33ibdndtqayh.onion/index.php/topic,2091.0.html    Mail Servers Located in USA  Riseup.net (https://riseup.net/en) - a collective based in the US that provides online communication tools for people and groups working on liberatory social change. Requires application and approval or invitation codes. Free email service does not log IP's or embed IP addresses in mail headers. Also provides a free VPN for members. You can also access your Riseup.net mail on Tor without javascript at https://zsolxunfmbfuq7wf.onion/  VFEMail (https://www.vfemail.net/) - free and paid email provider with the option to use a Netherlands server. Gold ($30/year) and Platinum ($50/year) automatically obfuscate metadata, a valuable option.   Riseup.net and VFEMail are the  only recommended US based email providers.    Mail Servers Located in Europe  ProtonMail (https://protonmail.ch/) - free, end-to-end encrypted email service based in Switzerland.  Autistici/Inventati (http://www.autistici.org/en/index.html) - A/I is an Italian collective similar to riseup.net that is dedicated to providing a full range of free, privacy aware internet services including webhosting and email. No logging of IP addresses. Requires application and approval.  OpenMailBox.org (https://www.openmailbox.org/) - free email service based in France accessible by webmail, IMAP or POP3. Strips IP from mail headers and does not log. The volume on the server that stores messages is encrypted with LUKS.   Bitmessage E-Mail Gateway (https://bitmessage.ch/) - Bitmessage E-Mail Gateway is a free service located in Switzerland that allows users to send and receive email to/from bitmessage addresses and also from/to any other email address. You do not need an email address to register and can access your mail through a webmail interface, Thunderbird or Outlook. Can be accessed over Tor. Also provides innovative 'localhost access' feature that allows you to hide your IP from the server and sent emails. Using the localhost access option you can connnect anonymously to the server without using Tor or a VPN, giving you anonymous email cheap and easy right from your browser.  Vmail.me (https://www.vmail.me/en/) - Vmail.me is a free service located in France offering webmail with IMAP and POP3 access. IPs are stripped from mail headers but the service does keep IP logs.   Mail Servers Located in Middle East  Privat DE Mail (http://mail.privatdemail.net/en/) - free EU based email service that does not log IP addresses with mail servers in Egypt. Email to Israel is blocked, which also blocks mail to and from Safe-Mail.net. Open registration. Uses a self-signed SSL certificate which can cause browser errors; install the 'Skip Cert Error' add-on to correct in Firefox or register with Internet Explorer instead.   If using Firefox once the 'Skip Cert Error' add-on is installed go to Add-ons Manager in Firefox > Extensions > Skip Cert Error 0.3.4 then click on 'Options' and add mail.privatdemail.net to the domain whitelist and you should be able to register.    Promising Start Ups  Other privacy aware email startups in order they will probably be available:  Startmail - https://beta.startmail.com  Mailpile - http://www.mailpile.is/  LEAP Encryption Access Project - https://leap.se/en/services/email   TAILS  TAILS (https://tails.boum.org/) is a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a USB drive and routes all your traffic through the Tor network. Because of the way TAILS is designed it leaves no traces of your internet activity on the host computer. Free i2p mail is integrated into TAILS as is the Claws Mail client. TAILS makes it easy to use free i2p mail. You can also setup Claws Mail to access your Lelantos Mail, Privat DE Mail or any other mail account accepting connection by Tor like Riseup.net.    Always use PGP encryption for privacy  Using an email service that will not reveal your location in the mail headers provides anonymity but not privacy! For sensitive email, you should always encrypt your email with PGP unless you are using i2p-Bote or Bitmessage, both of which transparently encrypt your email for you.

The Heartbleed Bug does not directly compromise the Tor client, or our members anonymity. However, our services rely on Heartbleed vulnerable TLS(SSL) connections such as for secure SMTP/POP3/IMAP connections to our servers.  Perhaps most concerning is that this security exploitation has existed for roughly two years. This is one of the results when government entities which, in our opinion, have known about this exploit - yet did nothing to warn and prevent it. The researchers who found this exploit have estimated that over 66% of ALL web servers and TLS services are affected by this bug.  Due to this very serious bug in the TLS protocol we decided to take our services offline until all our services have been patched. In addition, due to the way the Heartbleed Bug leaks memory information, it is possible that our server IP address an location were compromised. We cannot be certain that our backup server location is safe either.  After a thorough review of our logs we have not detected any suspicious activity, however we must assume and proceed on the basis that our server locations could have been compromised  We are proactively moving to freshly installed and patched servers at a new location to guarantee our continued anonymous and private service. This process is time consuming and we are working around the clock to have our service running 24/7 ASAP.  We expect Lelantos to be online again by April 10th. Lelantos exists to provide private, anonymous e-mail service. We ask for your patience and hope that you understand these steps were taken with your privacy and security in mind.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","764.0","2014-04-11T22:46:08","Axa's Guide to Secure Email Providers","General Discussion/Security"," You're such a liar, Mirage. I  never stated that one should not use special characters in Forum accounts, email accounts, etc. I was referring to specific requirements of the MailTor email service -- as usual, you are twisting/misrepresenting what was said to suit your own purposes. It is not for nothing that I have referred to you as a habitual (perhaps even pathological) liar. Nothing you say can be trusted -- that is one of the reasons you were banned from here and Silk Road.   You were told to do the math... either you are too stupid to understand the concepts, or too lazy to bother. I'll spell it out, not for your benefit, because you won't accept what I say anyway, but for others who may read your clueless, lie-filled screeds, so that they may apprise themselves of the facts.    You think the choice is  yours? Really? Can you be  that fucking clueless?  Here's a hint: password requirements are put in place by the person who puts the site(s) together.  They get to decide what you can use, not you, not I.    I don't delete your posts, the Admins/Mods here on the Hub are doing that. Your actions led to you being banned -- you have  NO ONE to blame but yourself for the fact that you have been banned.    As you were told before -- do the math!    Puerile insults are not going to win the day -- the facts are on my side, whether you wish to accept it or not. You are fully entitled to believe what you wish: that 2+2=5, that the sky is green, and that the moon is made of green cheese. The facts are otherwise, no matter how much you wish that it might not be so.    Once again, puerile insults will profit you little. Ad-hominem arguments are the last refuge of the desperate when neither logic nor the facts are on their side.   FWIW,  I am not denying you the 'right' to use whatever you wish in your passwords -- the site operators set the rules, not you nor I.   If you don't like the rules, don't use the site. I find it most interesting that you cannot (or more the point  will not) accept such a simple concept -- it has been made abundantly clear that you are NOT wanted here, yet you continue to return, and complain endlessly about your posts being deleted.    Calculating Password Strength  As you're likely aware, password strength (or resistance to brute-force or exhaustive searching) is a function of two variables:   1) Search space expressed as a number of characters; and   2) Password length, also expressed as a number of characters.   Let's take a trivial example. a 3-character, all-lowercase password.   The number of potential combinations is expressed as the search size raised to the power of the password length, i.e.: 26^3 = 17,576 which covers all the combinations from aaa through zzz.   Now let's consider an 8-character password, all lower-case:   26^8 = 208,827,064,576  So, as you can see, there are almost 209 billion combinations that must be searched, if a brute-force search is carried out. Let's add upper-case and numerics to the mix: 26+26+10 = 62. 62^8 = 2.18x10^14  We can now see that this figure is considerably larger.   Adding special characters into the mix, raises the search space to 96. Accordingly, we see the following result: 96^8 = 7.21x10^15 or about 33 times larger than when special characters are not used.   Using special characters is not a bad idea, particularly when faced with very short password lengths, like our examples above. Once we get past a certain point with password length, it really doesn't matter that much whether the search space is restricted or not.   Let's take the MailTor maximum password length, 35 characters:    Search space (chars)   PW Length    No. Combinations        Bits of Entropy  lowercase  (26)                  35                   3.3x10^49                     164  lower+upper (52)               35                   1.14x10^60                   199  + numeric (62)                    35                   5.41x10^62                   208   Even in the face of shorter maximum allowable passwords (like Tormail, which restricted maximum password lengths to 25 chars) you can still achieve very acceptable results:    Search space (chars)   PW Length    No. Combinations        Bits of Entropy  lowercase ( 26)                    25                  2.36x10^35                      117  lower+upper (52)                25                  7.94x10^42                      142  + numeric     (62)                 25                  6.45x10^44                      148  lowercase     (26)                  27                  1.6x10^38                   127   The number of bits of entropy is calculated using the following formula:  log(number of combinations)/(log(2)) = no. of bits of entropy  As you can clearly see from the above, quite respectable amounts of entropy can be achieved even with passwords of 25 characters. (In comparison the 3DES cipher (used in PGP) features 112-bits of entropy.)   It is currently believed that ciphers featuring 128-bit of entropy are safe from brute-force attacks; 256-bit ciphers have only been proposed as a measure in the event that quantum computers become a reality. As you can see, even a 27 character lowercase-only password features almost 128 bits of entropy, being on a par with the CAST5, IDEA, and AES128 ciphers as used in PGP.

Zaphod ","LELANTOS MAIL SERVICE UPDATE April 9th:On April 8th Lelantos began a security review of the HeartBleed Bug and the effects it could have on our service.The Heartbleed Bug does not directly compromise the Tor client, or our members anonymity. However, our services rely on Heartbleed vulnerable TLS(SSL) connections such as for secure SMTP/POP3/IMAP connections to our servers.Perhaps most concerning is that this security exploitation has existed for roughly two years. This is one of the results when government entities which, in our opinion, have known about this exploit - yet did nothing to warn and prevent it. The researchers who found this exploit have estimated that over 66% of ALL web servers and TLS services are affected by this bug.Due to this very serious bug in the TLS protocol we decided to take our services offline until all our services have been patched. In addition, due to the way the Heartbleed Bug leaks memory information, it is possible that our server IP address an location were compromised. We cannot be certain that our backup server location is safe either.After a thorough review of our logs we have not detected any suspicious activity, however we must assume and proceed on the basis that our server locations could have been compromisedWe are proactively moving to freshly installed and patched servers at a new location to guarantee our continued anonymous and private service.This process is time consuming and we are working around the clock to have our service running 24/7 ASAP.We expect Lelantos to be online again by April 10th.Lelantos exists to provide private, anonymous e-mail service. We ask for your patience and hope that you understand these steps were taken with your privacy and security in mind.Sincerely,LelantosUPDATE APRIL 11th:Lelantos is fully patched and protected against the Heartbleed security flaw.Due to our server maintenance this week, some accounts and e-mail data may not yet be accessible."

"The Hub Forums","axa","764.0","2014-05-04T05:12:44","Axa's Guide to Secure Email Providers","General Discussion/Security","There is a new secure email service hosted in Switzerland (like bitmessage.ch) called  ProtonMail. Here are some details taken from the website at https://protonmail.ch/   Zero Access to User Data: Your data is never accessible to us.  ProtonMail's segregated authentication and decryption system means logging into a ProtonMail account that requires two passwords. The first password is used to authenticate the user and retrieve the correct account. After that, encrypted data is sent to the user. The second password is a decryption password which is never sent to us. It is used to decrypt the userâs data in the browser so we never have access to the decrypted data, or the decryption password. For this reason, we are also unable to do password recovery. If you forget your decryption password, we cannot recover your data.   End-to-End Encryption: Messages are fully encrypted at all times.  Messages are stored on ProtonMail servers in encrypted format. They are also transmitted in encrypted format between our server and usersâ browsers. Messages between ProtonMail users are transmitted in encrypted form completely within our secured server network. Because they never leave our secured environment, there is no possibility to intercept the encrypted messages enroute.   100% Anonymous: No tracking or logging of personally identifiable information.  Unlike competing services, we do not log user activity. We do not save any metadata such as the IPs used to connect to accounts, or the times certain accounts are accessed. We utilize Google Analytics on only our homepage, but we have no ability to match that data with specific user accounts.   Securely communicate with other email providers: Even your communication with non-ProtonMail users is secure.  We support sending encrypted communication to non-ProtonMail users via symmetric encryption. When you send an encrypted message to a non-ProtonMail user, they receive a link which loads the encrypted message onto their browser which they can decrypt using a decryption passphrase that you have shared with them. You can also send unencrypted messages to Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook and others, just like regular email.   Self Destructing Messages: With ProtonMail, emails are no longer permanent.  You can set an optional expiration time on ProtonMailâs encrypted emails, so they will be automatically deleted from the recipient's inbox once they have expired. This way there are no ""trails"" of sent messages. Similar to SnapChat in a way, we've added a way for you to have even more ephemeral communication.   Trusted Cryptography: Time-tested encryption that is proven to be secure.  We use only the most secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP. Furthermore, all of the cryptographic libraries we use are open source. By using open source libraries, we can guarantee that none of the encryption tools we are using have clandestinely built in back doors. We are constantly consulting security experts including IT scientists at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research).   Hardware Level Security: Full disk encryption and storage in secured datacenters.  We have invested heavily in owning and controlling our own server hardware at several locations within Switzerland. They are collocated in some of the same secured and guarded datacenters used by Switzerlandâs famed private banks. We do this to ensure that even your encrypted data is not easily accessible to any third parties.  On a system level, our servers utilize fully encrypted hard disks with multiple password layers so data security is preserved even if our hardware is seized. On an organizational level, no single individual possesses all access passwords; they are separately kept by members with different citizenships.  These precautions may seem excessive, but in todayâs world, precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of human security compromises.   Server Side Integrity Checks: Protection even in the event of a full system compromise.  We run special routines on our servers to ensure that the code running on our systems is not illicitly changed without our knowledge in the event of a server compromise. This way, we can also ensure that the webpages we serve to users are not tampered in any way to allow collection of user data.   SSL Secured Connections: Swiss SSL to secure your connection.  We use SSL to secure communication between our server and your browser. Message data between our server and your browser is already sent encrypted, but we use SSL to add another layer of protection and to ensure that the web pages your browser loads is not tampered with by a third party intercepting your traffic in a MITM (Man in the Middle) attack.  Our SSL certificate authority (CA) is SwissSign, which is a wholly owned by Swiss Post which is a public institution owned by the Swiss Confederation. By using a CA owned by the Swiss government, we ensure the highest security for our users because it is extremely unlikely SwissSign can be coerced into validating another website impersonating us. To allow extremely security conscious users to further verify that they are in fact connecting to our server, we will also release the SHA3 hash for our SSL public key.   Easy to Use: Comprehensive Security for Everyone.  We created ProtonMail because we found that none of the existing secure email services available today are sufficiently secure. However, an extremely secure service like ProtonMail cannot improve the security landscape if it is so difficult to use nobody can use it. So from the start, we designed ProtonMail with a strong emphasis on usability. As a result, ProtonMail is extremely easy to use. There is nothing to install, and no encryption keys to manage, if you can use Gmail, Thunderbird, or Outlook, you can use ProtonMail. ",""

Many ppl may come back wihen the wallet's repair is common knowledge.","Agora was just very aggressive about marketing themselves when they started out and it paid off. They also ran a far more advanced, sophisticated, and secure operation compared to SR2 and was generally better overall. Because of its better security, it withstood while most of the competition got nailed by LE. Evo has recently been growing rapidly because it has an even better setup and is online more. They too run a very sophisticated (probably the most advanced) and secure operation and were also able to remain while the main competition got seized/shut down. Agora remains the biggest probably just because of its sheer number of listings and larger variety of offerings.

I know they once offered a bonus to those who referred others to their market. This caused many of the best vendors to go over to Agora. Once they went over and saw what a better operation it was, they likely never went back to the other sites.   Also, like I said before, it's also grown so large because it's withstood the test of time. While most of the competition has been destroyed, Agora remains alive and well. Just remaining and expanding. The superior security and level of sophistication over SR/SR2 is a major factor. Unlike DPR and his top cohorts, the people who run Agora and Evo are much more obscure, with very little info on who they could possibly be.   I have no source to verify this, but I personally think Evo is run wholly or partly by the Vory v Zakone mostly due to the site's focus on fraud items and close history with the notorious TCF.",""

"The Hub Forums","organix","1134.0","2014-02-22T00:42:10","Safe shipping practices","General Discussion/Security","What are the things the post office and dea look for to decide what packages to inspect closely? Billions of packages and letters are sent every year so they obviously can't inspect each one. They do not have dogs sitting by the conveyor belt which has mail whizzing by. It just doesn't work that way, dogs get bored quickly when they don't detect what they are trained to sniff for. Plus the length of time is not enough for a careful sniff.  They look for certain things, one of those is a false return name and address. They have high speed scanners which can scan the to and from address of each piece of mail. They have computers that will check it against known addresses and can match it to the name associated with that address. This helps them avoid sending out mail and having to send it back when its misaddressed. But they can also spot a false return. They won't investigate solely because of that but it is a red flag.  Other things they look for are strong odors coming from the package, like coffee, perfume, etc. That is usually used to mask the odor of drugs. They also look for hand written labels. No one of those things are enough but a suspicious odor will usually make them look further and if it has a false return, they will then usually bring in the dog and present the package along with some other packages to see if the dog alerts. If it does, that is probable cause to get a warrant.  When I send a package I always use a real name and address from the phone book. I print out the label so no hand written or typed labels which they look for. The goods have to be carefully packaged and if they have an odor, it must be put into mylar and well sealed. Also I don't handle the package when I have handled product.  I don't ask anyone to sign for the package, they can use that against you though its not solid proof. If they just drop it in your mailbox, wait a while before bringing it in. Take a walk and check out what's going on in the area before bringing it in. If its not supposed to be signed for and they ask you to sign, refuse the package. Or if its not supposed to be signed for but they knock on the door and present you with the package, that is very very suspicious. Obviously if they knock and talk, say nothing except to deny you ordered anything.  Anyone have other tips?",""

I do change my return addresses regularly and never go back to old ones.  Other tips to make your letter or package not stand out are:  Do not overly tape the outside of the package. This is another thing they look for. You can tape the inside and it will not show.   Make sure the contents don't rattle or shift around.   If sending powders, put them inside multiple packaging to resist penetration. Postal employees have been known to puncture a package to better sniff the contents.  Instead of using dryer sheets or other scented things to mask the odor, invest in mylar packaging to stop odor. Another good thing to use is aluminum foil bags sealed with aluminum tape.",""
"The Hub Forums","organix","1134.0","2014-02-22T17:54:54","Safe shipping practices","General Discussion/Security","There are many other things I haven't mentioned. For example, use gloves when handling goods, when packing, and when mailing. An alternative for using gloves when dropping your mail off is to put it in a plastic bag wearing gloves and then they can be slid from the bag directly into the blue box, no gloves needed at that point.  Try to not use the same box every time, mix it up a little. That is particularly true if you send out a lot of mail every day.  Tips for receiving mail  1. Do not order anything you have to sign for. That makes it too easy to set up a controlled delivery.  2. When you get your package, let it sit in the mailbox for a while before you take it in. Don't be in such a rush, in fact its good to take a little walk to eyeball the neighborhood to spot suspicious vehicles, people loitering for no obvious reason, etc. 3. After you get your mail, let it sit by the door a while unopened. If they bang on your door asking if you got anything you didn't expect to get, say yes and hand it over. If its unopened it makes you look innocent and adds support to your statement that you didn't order it.",""

Use mylar at the minimum, aluminum foil bags are even better.

"The Hub Forums","Hansmann","8937.0","2015-05-13T01:36:47","Need help with:","Start Here/For Beginners"," None of my fellow Hubsters have answered your questions and since my intention is to be helpful that is what I will do.   I am not in to the whole narcotics thing so best to ask someone else. The most popular markets currently are Silk Road 3.0, Nucleus, Agora, Pandora and Middle Earth these places all have mult-sig escrow meaning that the vendor doesn't get your bitcoin until you have claimed the package has come, if it never comes it is a scam and you will get your money back.   Speaking of scamming let me tell you a little story. There was a extremely popular vendor named Tony77(I think, correct me if I'm wrong), he was trusted and well known for his distribution of drugs and goods. Him, being extremely trusted, decided to scam people to make hundreds of thousands of dollars. He made customers pay up front rather than using the traditional escrow people fell for it since he was trusted, he made hundreds of thousands of dollars and left DNMs(to everyones knowledge) never to return, walking away with the money. Point is avoid vendors who ask to pay upfront.  As for your question about bitcoins, this question was answered in a previous thread started by libertygangster but I'll respond to this.   The way I buy and store bitcoins is the following:   I purchase bitcoins off of localbitcoins.com you can purchase them in multiple ways FTF, bank transaction, credit card, amazon gift card etc.(if you live in a small town/city FTF is unlikely). Once you've bought bitcoins on localbitcoins.com you have them stored on local bitcoins. Now, bitcoins are like paper cash, you store it in a wallet, that wallet has a certain address that people can obtain in order to send you bitcoin. To prevent your bitcoins from being stolen you must make a new address on a .onion address I use Blockchain(now, I do at least). Blockchain's address(not bitcoin address, haha) is https://blockchainbdgpzk.onion/. This is known as cold storage and the owner of the site doesn't know your password which makes it almost impossible for you to be ripped off, Blockchain also has never been hacked. Your bitcoins are now safely stored on Blockchain, great... NOT SO FAST.   Your intentions seem to obtain drugs which I believe are illegal. If you just send bitcoins to a certain website to buy drugs it leaves a paper trail you see:  Credit/Bank/Gift Card---> Localbitcoins---> Blockchain---> Drug Market  They can trace your card back to you and you will be arrested. To avoid this, you must tumble/mix your bitcoins, this makes the origin of your bitcoins unknown. Multiple sites will do this Bitblender is an example. The address is the following: bitblendervrfkzr.onion this doubles as a wallet/blender(mixer/tumbler) so you must send your bitcoins to Bitblender they will blend the bitcoin you have now obtained now the Feds don't know where your bitcoin you will now spend on an drug market came from.   Another impeccible way to earn bitcoin is to send them to: 19dhSzPqzArSRPTU7MF7HzK2p1npVH7rxa  Just joking, that is my address, you want to keep your bitcoins I'm assuming.  Also, this is sort of relevant to your question:  In order to make a Blockchain account you need to have a valid darknet email address, I personally use Mail2Tor after Zaphod convinced me to stop using Torbox do to the low entropy of password combinations. Use Mail2Tor to verify log in attempts(before you send your bitcoin to Bitblender).   Any other inane questions you would like to ask?","Finding (reliable) vendors for opiates, RX or not.

In all actuality, you should tell them to read all the available information on what steps that need to be taken to protect themselves and the different programs they must understand and master before they even attempt to dive into the deep.  I am an old school guy, when I was in college we used Word Processors, no computers.  I think my senior year I took my first computer class, we wrote little dos programs, played games etc. That was the end of my computer use untill maybe 8 years ago when I bought my son his first desktop to help him with school.  When I decided that I wanted to checkout the different marketplaces and maybe purchase some of the wares offered, I did research for about 6 months, got familiar with socks, tails, PGP, Jabber OTRs just to name a few.  It was actually about 9 months before I thought I was prepared and finally registered with Evo, I spent a couple days just watching and reading the different posts getting familiar with the rules and how the system worked.  Third day Evo ducked out with everyones BTC.  My point is, you guys that have mastered all the ins and outs of the Dark Net could have held my hand and tried to explain the different programs I would need and a brief explanation how they worked, but instead of helping, your assistance would lead to me failing at being a contributing member of a facinating but dangerous place.  Anyone wanting to venture into the dark has to get their hands dirty, do hours and hours of research, go through the different forums reading the pinned information and all the newbies questions asked before us then one can begin preparing their computer and learning all the needed programs needed to safely browse the different market places. The user will have a much greater chance of being a reliable buyer for years to come simply by being forced to make the decision if they truly believe the many hours of work and frustration are worth their want and desire to frequent the different hidden sites.. Hopefully they realize and appreciate the severity of their actions and now after all this they can ask the different experienced members relevant questions that no one minds answering.  Believe me New Users will be better off and hopefully be around for awhile.",""

I am a firefighter and a very proud father of a wonderful 5 year old who is an amazing kid and to whom I am trying to teach the ways  of the world in order to believe n himself and the truths of the world. but alas I have been hit by one of those truths squarely in the face and thus need your help. It all begins in my youth being raised by an over protective mother and a father who most likely had a child too old (58) My father died an alchoholic thus sending me on the almost opposite path.I was in my twenties when both of my parents passed away and went down the wrong path doing drugs and not really caring about myself but others much more. I never sold drugs only doing them myself, my demons caused me to move to a different country in an attempt to rid my self of them but alas they followed like every good demon would and 14 years ago I woke up to a deafening roar telling me that my last chance had come.I heeded that warning and have ever since been a proud firefighter fulfilling my destiny that my mother always told me i had to help others and she had done all her life. All this comes to my plea which i will elaborate and substansiant if and when you decide you care enough to know. My whole reason for being is under attack by a malicious person who has accused me of a heinous crime that i could not would not and could never do and this person is ruining my life to the tune of 20 000 dollars and i need help to keep my family afloat.I am ever so surprised that the people who on the ""normal"" web dont care I have emailed wrote made pages and still nothing even though all of my story is in the media and all the evidense is on my side I still cannot get any financial help and it is killing me slowly as the only reason i am able to write this is the fact that when I am with my 5 year old I feel the presense of G-d all around me and I would never leave my wonderful son alone without my one of a kind guildance. So there it is my story in a tiny nutshell.  With all this being said is there any help out there? Is there anyone is this world that i too belong to able to guide me,assist me in any way shape or form? for some reason I have never been able to protect myself but i have always protected others.  Thank you so much for your time and patience with reading this I feel at home here allowing my thoughts to be read and understood as the ""normal""web does not care.  Big cat",""

I will never run away but wow it is soooo hard to cope with this especially when you are 100 percent innocent.  No once again Oddly enough my wife(we are seperated has been beside me this whole time ) she showed in my defense and has made sure everybody knows that this other ""person"" is a wack job that has a shitty life so is trying to bring me down as well  I know at the very beginning of all this i read the comments in the media and i was astonised by human nature and than when another acticle came out with my innocense as the theme some of those same people were like ohhhhh ummmmm ohhhhh so i stopped reading them and have been trying to concentrate on just getting through all this.  Very true on the part time jobs I have been doing that and barely surviving making it but just barely  Well on the religon part I have to agree and disagree I whole heartedly believe in a god but will never believe in any human telling another human that they are the ones that are right and everybody else is wrong,I cannot stand humanity in this aspect I have been a student of theology all my life and will never quite understand why people do not understand that there is a G-d one G-d and he belongs to no one and wars and waste and destruction are caused by people who think otherwise.   And lastly well second to lastly haha I have done many things in my life and consider myself relatively intelligent so please if you do have something I would be interested in at least trying !

To clarify that:  1) Continue to stay positive and consistent in your childs life, patience and time will win this one.  2) Since being a firefighter pays just over 40K / year, build a routine that allows you to keep your job while going to college or university to obtain a degree in something that you enjoy doing and will pay more. Obviously if things are not working out and you aren't happy, it's time to change it up.  3) Learn from your parents mistakes but also understand that nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes.  4) Running away from your problems does not solve your problems, it only tucks them away to eat you up over time.   5) I am going to assume your ex-wife is accusing you of some type of crime. Fuck her. Ex's will attempt to cause you misery, don't let them get that far. Whats done is done and you must setup a boundary for them and keep them there.  6) Asking for help online, whether it be here or on the web is not always the best advice. Opinions from people who do not know the entire situation will never give the best opinions to you. Try reading some books that help pick you up and leave you in a positive mood.  7) Financial help can be as easy as picking up some part-time jobs, or if you are interested in going back to school to obtain a degree, there are loans available to help you to achieve your goals. Even if you have to cross the t's and dot the i's to ensure your approval, do it. I've opened margin accounts for 1M by answering and providing the right criteria (with $100K down).    God and religion are an illusion, it was a support system so that the human race wouldn't go crazy. Now it's just used as a tool to provide you with confidence in hard times while asking you for money at some point. Stephen Hawkings theory of ""god"" is absolutely correct. Believe in yourself and your abilities, that there is always light at the end of the tunnel so long as you continue to work toward it and never give up.  9) I do not know if you have any technical abilities, or if you are just good at putting out fires! However, if you have any technical experience, our company would be more than happy to provide you with freelance work.  In the end; Money > Power > Respect.  Money may not buy true happiness, but it will definitely allow you to live a comfortable lifestyle while you seek out the aspects that make you truly happy!  The best part of my morning is hopping in my Porsche to head to the gym. This car has made me more happy on a daily basis than any other bitch and never lets me down, besides when its out of gas  ",""

Its very unlikely that they catch you through tor or even bitcoin (although be careful here and mix coins before you connect identy), more likely they do it because you make stupid mistakes like meeting up in person or not using bitcoin to name the worst examples. Also take care to keep conversations with customers as impersonal as possible, always talk like a robot or a politician.

Introduction and noob questions","Start Here/For Beginners"," It's not Tails per-se, that you have to worry about writing to your usb stick. We're all aware of malware designed by our friends over at the 3 letter agencies -- if you boot Tails from DVD, the worst that can happen is that you can corrupt the memory image, which will dissapear when you re-boot anyway. You can't write to a read-only media like a DVD.  That's why booting from DVD is preferable, whereever and whenever possible. When you boot from USB, there is a very small chance that malware you may have contracted will overwrite part of your Tails installation on the USB stick, with potentially disastrous consequences. If you laptop doesn't have a DVD, then why don't you buy an external USB DVD drive? They're not expensive, and they're very handy for making permanent backups of data like encryption keys and the like.

You can connect to a VPN before connecting to tor, to add another layer of safety, I guess that cant hurt. if you want to play it extra safe, get a anonymous sim card and connect via UMTS before tor and/or vpn.wasting too much thought on irrelevant stuff makes you sloppy in situations where you need to be cautious. think of this example before you make the technical side to complicated(http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png)(thx EG   );The funny thing about the mac-address spoofing is that the only way that even matters in any way is because you're using hacked/public wifi.  If you're on your own wifi network its pointless.  So don't bother with using public wifi and you don't ""need"" to spoof the mac address.  Using hacked/public wifi to access the darknet is itself overkill of course because if the NSA wants to deposit a trojan onto your machine they can do so from public wifi just as easily as from your home wifi, and once they've installed their spookware your identity will be revealed anyway.  But as long as you turn off javascript the likelihood of a trojan being deposited on your machine via Tor is almost nil."

Anyone with physical access to your usb drive could modify your tails version easily, and if an attacker had the control of your tail install or your computer when it's running, any modification would still be there at each reboot as it's possible to write on the usb stick system partition - and that's not possible with a CD/DVD.

It's strengh is that if you run it from a Live CD or DVD it's impossible to write on it meaning that if it gets compromised it will start clean on next reboot. Ive never heard anyone else mention this. I don't have the option of using a CD because of the laptop I use for tails. When I yank it out as if I were interrupted, it also starts clean on next reboot. Tails by design doesn't write anything onto the stick after it's installed, right?It's not Tails per-se, that you have to worry about writing to your usb stick. We're all aware of malware designed by our friends over at the 3 letter agencies -- if you boot Tails from DVD, the worst that can happen is that you can corrupt the memory image, which will dissapear when you re-boot anyway. You can't write to a read-only media like a DVD.  That's why booting from DVD is preferable, whereever and whenever possible. When you boot from USB, there is a very small chance that malware you may have contracted will overwrite part of your Tails installation on the USB stick, with potentially disastrous consequences. If you laptop doesn't have a DVD, then why don't you buy an external USB DVD drive? They're not expensive, and they're very handy for making permanent backups of data like encryption keys and the like. Zaphod"

"The Hub Forums","the_other_walter","8761.0","2015-05-03T20:45:54","Mass Surveillance Exempt from the Law","General Discussion/Security","Here's an article I read in Charlie Hebdo. I believe I don't need to present this newspaper to you... unfortunately. The fact that the journalist who wrote it (Laurent Leger) lost most of his colleagues and friends in the terrorist attack in last January makes his point of view all the more interesting.  ","MASS SURVEILLANCE EXEMPT FROM THE LAW The government is playing to the gallery with a bill legalizing forms of espionage that have been in force for ages. Meanwhile, the mass surveillance system set up by France's external intelligence agency, the DGSE, is in no danger of being challenged.A former spy told Charlie : ""After years of use in the United States, there is no evidence that this kind of system has ever prevented a single attack."" For Alain Chouet, a former top official at the agency, the NSA mass surveillance program, which intercepts billions of  telecommunications data points is absolutely futile. ""Bear in mind that undifferentiated surveillance is unusable."" Given that the volume of data generated every year exceeds the total amount amassed over 5,000 years, the crass conceit of the American program is all too evident.And yet the DGSE has set up a similar system, at least with respect to undifferentiated data collection. As reported in Le Monde, the French intelligence services use supercomputers for surveillance and telecommunications data collections abroad. This national ""hub"" has a threefold objective: collecting phone and internet data, picking up satellite transmissions and deciphering encrypted messages. The supposedly top-secret system is well known in intelligence circles, since the data collected is shared with other intelligence services in the defense, interior and finance ministeries - and even the justice department when it comes to deciphering coded files and hard drives. (...)So how does it work? France being a hub for the global flow of internet data, especially between the U.S.A. and the Middle East and Africa, the French intelligence agency has placed underwater cables in all the right places to ""hoover up"" data. And with its great satellite ears deployed at several points around the globe, it adds up to just one thing: we'll listen in and lift everything you exchange, on the internet or in phone conversations; digital traces of your connections on Facebook and Twitter, text messages and geo location data, all of it in a very murky legal fog. Billions of points that are impossible to digest immediately are redistributed for the most part in batches to the intelligence services of the United States, Canada, Great Britain, etc. Some of Charlie's interlocutors disclosed that all recent exchanges detected in Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as in two or three sensitive areas of the planet, were being picked up by the French intelligence agency. Perhaps this is how the government is able to put an exact figure on how many French people have gone off to wage jihad? Trawling for French nationals But all this creates a number of issues. What can the understaffed French intelligence agency do with such an avalanche of details, even when analyzed by keywords? Little or nothing.Perhaps find out that a mobile phone previously tracked in the greater Paris area has suddenly relocated to Syria. Counter-terrorism might be able to make use of that at some stage. Then again, one would have to be sure the guy tracked through his mobile phone isn't a travel agent. There are still those fool hardy enough to be traipsing around Crusader castles these days.The second issue is a major one: in casting the net abroad, they are certain to pick up a lot of personal French data on the rebound, and not just about potential terrorists. But since only outside espionage- i.e. beyond our borders and targeting foreign citizens- escapes French law, how can these components be legalized? The bill examined in parliament last week tries to address the issue, but monitoring of these operations is weak in relation to common law, already quite dented in terms of civil liberties. The time limit for storing and destroying the information will begin not from when it is collected, but from when it is used. Thus, potentially, years later. As for the green light from the monitoring committee, it will be given after the surveillance, not before. Meanwhile, mass surveillance abroad is authorized de facto, with ""the possibility""- as stated in impact study - that the committee will monitor the surveillance. But that's not a certainty.In any case the International Federation for Human Rights and the French Human Rights League will soon file complaints and institute civil action (...)"

There is a list on The Hub called DNM Wall of Shame it is a list of hidden services seized by law enforcement. I will put Tor Bazaar in bold.  Atlantis Market: Shut down sometime after the SR1 takedown and took users' funds.  Sheep Marketplace: Shut down shortly after a massive heist in December 2013, perhaps the worst ever seen on a DNM, in which US$6 million dollars (possibly much, much more) worth of BTC was stolen by hackers. The massive number of BTC caused tumbler Bitcoin Fog to crash. It is believed that the hacker(s) disposed of the BTC by selling them to BTC-E, Coinbase, etc.  Deepbay: Short-lived scam site. Admin is believed to have disabled withdrawls and took users' BTC before shutting down.  Budster: Site shut down after vendor Turtle Time allegedly hacked into and stole around 400 BTC from users.  Project Black Flag: Site shut down and the admin took users' funds.  TorMarket: Site shut down, possibly seized by LE. One theory is that the site's admin was snitched out by a former SR2 mod when he was arrested back late-2013-early-2014.  FloMarket: Admin shut down site and took users' funds, although he denied it in a later interview.  Cantina Marketplace: Security was poor and buggy from the start, although the site's admin denied it. The site had tons of SQL injection errors (they offered a 5 BTC bounty to anybody who could successfully perform one onto their market to prove its security) but the marketplace's admin and mods denied such claims despite the evidence. Basically a very poorly built and designed market and very vulnerable to hackers and LE.  Black Goblin Market: Short-lived site due to such poor design. Within maybe 5 days from launch, the site was ""de-anonymized"", which may be worse than being hacked, as it opens the path for an easy LE investigation; they can easily subpoena the host or ISP to get everything they know, like what's on the server, what IPs connect to it, who was paying for it, etc. And this means such a market can never get very big or last very long.  Utopia Marketplace: Seized by Dutch police in early-2014.  Silk Road 2.0 (SR2): Where to start on this one? Despite vastly improved security over SR1, the site was supposedly hacked on Febuary 13, 2014 with US$2.7 million dollars worth of users' funds in escrow being stolen. The admin ""Defcon"" stated that the hack had been made possible due to a vulnerability in Bitcoin's protocol called ""transaction malleability"". However, in all likelihood, Defcon and a couple of close mods were the true thieves of the BTC and they made up the ""transaction malleability"" as an excuse to cover the heist. A dedicated group of mods did pay back many of the ripped off users by using their own commission funds, but the marketplace was in clear decline after the incident. The site was seized by LE on November 6, 2014 with Defcon (Blake Benthall) and most of his mods being arrested as part of the massive Operation Onymous.  MixBit Cointumbling: Scamsite that will successfully process smaller amounts of BTC, but in larger amounts will simply take your money and run. They are very slow too.  Drugslist: The admin is MIA; probably having stolen users' funds and ran off.  Pandora: Site was hacked by 2 former vendors who successfully stole 1/2 of the site's/users' funds. Later the admins allegedly shut down the site and took users' funds.  The Armory: Originally a sister site to SR1 but it shut down in 2012 due to lack of demand for guns. The site appeared again later and worked for a bit, but it quickly became a scamsite, using a shady escrow system and not processing orders. The site went offline in early-2014, probably as part of an exit scam.  TorEscrow: Former escrow service that pulled a large exit scam around the time of 4/20/2014 by disabling withdrawls and deleting the site along with its forums.  Cannabis Road: Site shut down after it cliamed it had been robbed. The more likely theory is that its admin and mods stole its users' funds and ran off.  The Pirate Market: Disabled withdrawls and the site's hosts have disappeared. Most likely as part of an exit scam.  1776 Marketplace: Hosted on a Windows server, a serious OPSEC issue.  BitBlender: They claimed they were hacked and lost money. However, the site's admins likely stole the money.  Hydra: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Cloud-Nine (C9): Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Alpaca Marketplace: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  BlueSky: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.   Tor Bazaar: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Diabolus Marketplace: Renamed themselved to SR3/SRR after the SR2 takedown. Trying to grow and cash in on the name.  Andomeda: Supposedly seized by LE on November 18, 2014; however, many believe it's fake and the site's hosts pulled an exit scam.  Torbook: Facebook-style DNM social network literally designed by a 17 year old; need I say more? Oh yeah, the site's admin was arrested by Belgian police and the site went into maintnence mode. Had CP posted on it. Likely seized by Belgian LE.","Quote from: Jack Harkness on May 16, 2015, 10:28:13 pmI think EvilGrin was a mod for Tor Bazaar Alpha (TBA).

After being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided, Ralph spent the next three years in prison.[54] Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, for instance admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with income tax evasion, as well as with various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson.[55] U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson (who had been aware of the deal all along) refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On the second day of the trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client. Saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk, Wilkerson deemed the 1930 letter to federal authorities from a lawyer acting for Capone could be admitted into evidence.[56][57][58]"

Are they saving your cleartext email to their drives before encryption? If so, the plaintext may be recoverable. Using a ramdisk? Are they zeroing the RAM afterwards?

Why do I say this? Well, the devil is in the details.  If you are going to use a provider that encrypts all incoming emails, the most important thing to remember is, ""Who generated the key?"" What you want, is a situation where you provide your own public key, that you generated yourself on your own computer, as opposed to a situation like Hushmail, where the provider generates the key using an applet on your own hardware, but they store both halves of the keypair for you.    Hushmail-type systems are a literal disaster. If you want more details outlining why this is so, just search for the term, ""Operation Raw Deal"".

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","6093.0","2014-12-17T00:19:34","Email that enrypts incoming messages","General Discussion/Security"," Yep, which is why end to end encryption is the gold standard.  The only thing automatic encryption may be of assistance with, is in the case of stored emails, e.g. for buyers who don't use PGP, sending email to a vendor. In such a case, if the authorities went after the stored email, they would be unable to read it.   Like I said, end to end encryption is the gold standard. As always, the problem is that too few people are bothering to use it.

This will already make alloutgoing connections be anonymized, but more is possible.  -socks=5        SOCKS5 supports connecting-to-hostname, which can be used instead                  of doing a (leaking) local DNS lookup. SOCKS5 is the default,                  but SOCKS4 does not support this. (SOCKS4a does, but isn't                  implemented).  -proxy=ip:port  Set the proxy server. If SOCKS5 is selected (default), this proxy                  server will be used to try to reach .onion addresses as well.  -onion=ip:port  Set the proxy server to use for tor hidden services. You do not                  need to set this if it's the same as -proxy. You can use -noonion                  to explicitly disable access to hidden service.  -listen         When using -proxy, listening is disabled by default. If you want                  to run a hidden service (see next section), you'll need to enable                  it explicitly.  -connect=X      When behind a Tor proxy, you can specify .onion addresses instead  -addnode=X      of IP addresses or hostnames in these parameters. It requires  -seednode=X     SOCKS5. In Tor mode, such addresses can also be exchanged with                  other P2P nodes.  -onlynet=tor    Only connect to .onion nodes and drop IPv4/6 connections.An example how to start the client if the Tor proxy is running on local host onport 9050 and only allows .onion nodes to connect:  darkcoin-qt -onion=127.0.0.1:9050 -onlynet=tor -listen=0 -addnode=darkcoinie7ghp67.onion https://github.com/darkcoin/darkcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md Full Docs Mirror: http://darkcoinie7ghp67.onion/tor.txt","Quote from: Zaphod on February 20, 2015, 05:26:51 pmQuote from: elan on February 20, 2015, 01:30:47 pmAre there any guides or experiences running a darkcoin wallet in tails or in general with tor?I keep getting no connections with the -onlynet=tor option. running it with -onion=127.0.0.1:9050 works, but I would prefer to connect to onion nodes only.The reason for the lack of guides, I suspect, it it's newness.

If not, you simply go to http://blockchain.info and press the button ""Wallet"" and you can open up your existing wallet or create a new account. Very straight forward and can be done all from your web browser.    But what about Electrum? Electrum is an easy to use Bitcoin client. It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart. There is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain. If you use the normal Bitcoin client from https://bitcoin.org then you would need to download the entire blockchain, which is several GB of data. In Tails, we are trying not to download too much to our computers. Downloading the entire BlockChain can take over 24 hours.   So how do we set up Electrum in Tails? First thing we need to do is download it.https://download.electrum.org/Electrum-1.9.7.tar.gz   Now extract it (right click -> Extract here) and rename the folder to electrum to make things easier. (Right click -> Rename). You might also want to move the folder to the tmp directory so it is easier to find. (Places -> Computer -> File System -> tmp)    Next open up a terminal and type the following commandcd /tmp/electrum    You can replace /tmp/electrum with whatever directory electrum is currently in, but this is why we put it in tmp, to make things easier for us. Next type the following command../electrum -s 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost:9050   This will allow your electrum to connect through Tor, to make sure it does not connect over clearnet. You will get a warning when you do this that electrum is attempting to connect in an unsafe manner, but this is expected, and do not worry, it is safe to do this. This step was recommended on the Tails web page at the following URL.https://tails.boum.org/forum/Report:_the_electrum_bitcoin_client_in_tails/Since you are likely going to want to reuse your wallet that is generated in Electrum, you can specify where your wallet is kept by replacing the above command with the following command../electrum -s 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost:9050 -w /tmp/electrum.dat   You would replace /tmp/electrum.dat with whatever the path to your wallet is, and you can rename electrum.dat to whatever you want to call your wallet, like srwallet.dat or whatever you want. Or leave it the way that it is. Then each time you want to start up electrum, reuse the same command, and make sure you copy electrum.dat into /tmp or whatever directory you wish to use. Then when you are finished, make sure to back up electrum.dat onto your USB drive or SD card, especially if you do not have Tails persistence. This way you can reuse the same wallet and you will not lose your balance.    Electrum is likely going to be the Bitcoin client of choice for Tails users. And you can read more about how to use Electrum by visiting the home page at the following link.https://electrum.org;I use 4rwpmjwjfocguylj.onion:50001 without issue.;Try it with Protocol: TCP and Proxy: None (should be the default settings)."

Please read it thoroughly before using The Hub, and remember to check back regularly in case of changes. Failure to comply could lead to account deletion or suspension.   1. No Trading  You may not facilitate trades using The Hub, either via public message boards or our PM system. There are no exceptions to this rule, and users found doing so will be either warned, suspended or deleted depending on the circumstances. If spotted, please report any violation of this rule to a staff member for investigation.   2. When Promoting Products You Sell:  a) You may only link to your official marketplace vendor profile when posting.  Do not make posts discussing your products or services without including a link to your marketplace profile.  That is what the marketplaces are for.  b) You must have verified as a vendor and have the ""Vendor"" tag  c) You must not attempt to promote trade via any other means such as Email - even if the market you vend on is currently out of action.   3. Prohibited Items  The promotional discussion of certain items, and discussion that endorses certain behaviours, is not permitted. As a general rule, prohibited items and topics should be considered those that are designed to harm others, or harm others by their design. This includes (but is not limited to) items and topics on the following list:  - Child Pornography - Fraud - Weapons - Explosives  It is natural that these items and topics may surface in natural, non-promotional, objective discussion, and we believe that in most circumstances there is no harm in this.   4. No 'Doxxing'  We are all members of a relatively anonymous community. Please respect one another's anonymity and never post details, suspected or known, regarding a community member's 'Real Life' identity.   5. No Spam  Spam comes in many forms, such as: Advertisements; links to malicious content; content with zero value. The Hub is not a place for posting this kind of content, and spammers will have their accounts and posts deleted.   6. No Trolling  According to Wikipedia:  ""In Internet slang, a troll is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a forum, chat room, or blog), either accidentally or with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion""  Trolls are not looked upon kindly; their accounts may be restricted or banned, and their posts may be removed or moved to an appropriate sub-forum.   Please enjoy your time here at The Hub, and as with anything incredible, use responsibly!",""

Tor Browser - it has 2 components, Firefox and Tor.  Firefox uses Mozilla's NSS library for SSL so it is  not vulnerable.  Tor is  vulnerable so you should upgrade to the latest Tor Browser 3.5.4 immediately. An attacker could potentially read your session data, including sites you visit, login cookies (proving you are a specific person logged into a market or forum), etc.   SSH - uses OpenSSL and is  vulnerable.   OpenVPN - uses OpenSSL and is  vulnerable.   curl - uses OpenSSL and is  vulnerable.   wget - uses OpenSSL and is  vulnerable.   ntp - uses OpenSSL and is  vulnerable.  All of these dynamically link libssl so the library needs to be upgraded to a fixed version. In the case of sshd, ntp and openvpn which usually run continuously, they should be restarted after updating libssl.   Pidgin - libpurple uses NSS and is  not vulnerable.   Adium - uses libpurple which uses NSS so it is  not vulnerable.   OTR - all plugins that I am aware of use Gcrypt and are  not vulnerable.   mIRC - haven't checked but since it's Windows only so assuming it's  not vulnerable.   Xchat - the Linux version and possibly the Windows version use OpenSSL for client-to-server encryption. It is  vulnerable. The major issue here is if you connected to a hidden service IRC server while simultaneously connecting over clearnet to an IRC server with SSL. The clearnet server could deanonymize you as a specific user on the hidden service IRC. You should update OpenSSL immediately.  Feel free to add to this list.",""

Any application that provides anonymity and has heartbeat enabled is under fire.   Any anonymity application that functions as a server (all p2p applications are server-like) and uses OpenSSL could potentially be exploited and details in the memory could possibly contain information that reveals the real identity of a user.  This is not mentioned much in popular media as it is not the primary concern of the general public but it is a reality for every one in the darknet community.  It is best to check all applications used for communication as they are often run directly from the system.  I guess this is a prime example of why using a non-persistent OS such as Tails is important; even then, running Tails with the real IP exposed to the OS is at the moment possibly dangerous if a user is using pre-built binaries that do not dynamically link to the system's OpenSSL.",""

Check out The Tin Hat @ https://thetinhat.com/ or http://qza32xuddl3guikc.onion/ or thetinhat.i2p, he has written some very informative articles regarding I2P in general.  Here is a Reddit post from /u/sapiophile:   Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2loixp/how_le_might_read_our_pgp_messages_and_how_we_can/clwqf5f","I actually love I2P, and I've been using it for years and years, since the jrandom days. Learned about it just after I learned about Tor, way back when.I think its design is actually far, far superior to Tor's for hidden services, mostly because of two things:    Much lower barrier of entry for relays, meaning there's probably a lower percentage of LE-controlled relays as compared to Tor (of course, there's no way to confirm this), and,    COVER TRAFFIC. Holy shit, cover traffic. That shit is so important. It makes timing and correlation attacks way, way, WAY harder to pull off. If you're running an active I2P Router with lots of good participating tunnels, it's gonna be damn hard for anyone to know which eepsites you're visiting or serving, or if you're visiting or serving any at all. Tor has absolutely nothing like this, and I honestly think it's a huge security improvement.EDIT: Oh, also, not using designated Entry Guards for hidden services is a big security improvement, as well. A malicious Entry Guard on Tor can really fuck your day up if you're using hidden services.EDIT2: Oh, also also, I2P uses one-directional tunnels instead of two-directional circuits, which is a way more secure design from an anonymity standpoint.Also, I2P offers a lot that Tor does not, and can not offer, like anonymous BitTorrent, IRC, etc. (ProTip: if you're using BitTorrent over Tor, you're a fool and you're NOT protected, and you're just severely damaging the network) I2P is also rolling out a new set of ciphers for their traffic encryption and signing at the moment, and will soon be using mostly Ed25519 and ECDSA, which are almost definitely a big step up from Tor's RSA-1024.There's also some problems with I2P, though:    It's definitely not nearly as reviewed or audited as Tor is, just because it isn't in the spotlight as much. This is fairly significant, but of course, even widely popular projects like OpenSSL don't get the review they need, and we end up with stuff like Heartbleed. So it's hard to place a distinct value on. I2P also gets less attention from some of the ""big names"" in the cryptography and security world compared to Tor, which is really unfortunate.    To be really secure and reliable, people using it really have to leave it running for a while (at least a couple days, preferably, but really, 24/7 is best) and configure their network/firewall for it. Of course it works without doing those things, but it works way, way better and WAY more securely if you do (see note above about cover traffic). This is a serious hurdle for a lot of end-users.    Because the relays are mostly home connections, it's slower and less reliable (for eepsite/service reachability) than Tor. With more users sharing more of their bandwidth, though, it could theoretically start being even better than Tor in these respects. This is especially true into the future, as home connections start to have some serious speeds and IPv6 starts getting rolled out for real.I don't have the time or the qualifications to really review the code or the implementation, but from what I've read from the devs, and the interactions I've seen between them and other people, I feel like they're pretty competent. I would love nothing more than for someone with real credentials to have a real, hard look at I2P's code, but there's almost certainly nothing that's really obviously wrong with it.When Exodus released their exploit against I2P a little while back, it relied on browser JavaScript and XSS - pretty much the shallowest and simplest possible ways that something like this can be attacked. That issue was also incredibly simple to fix, as it has been. So that's definitely a good sign, in a sense - the underlying protocol was not easily attacked by them, and they are perhaps the most professional and competent security researchers to have tried their hand against I2P.All told, I think DNMs should really be on I2P and not Tor. But I think the biggest obstacle to that is getting the influx of new users to actually set up their I2P machines to help relay traffic."

We can ask the application to generate a specific number of combinations (Address/PrivateKey) and MyCoins will write this data on a file specified by the user, along with a second file that will have only your Addresses (so you can share them quickly). You must keep of course the first file safe, as it haves your Private Keys.  Check this tool's other features!  Usage  -- Generate Keys and Addresses (1) --  (1) Random  Enter the number of combinations you want and filename to write. Example: wallet.txt  (2) PassPhrase  If you want to make sure you can recover your Key, use a PassPhrase you can remember to generate your combination.  -- Verify Key/Address (2) --  Verify manually. Enter any Private Key you wish to check and MyCoins will display its Address, if it is valid.  -- File (3) --  One of this tool's most useful features. Enter the name of a file with Key/Address combinations and MyCoins will check all, if it has the proper format. See files generated by MyCoins. NOTE: Files must be on the same Folder.  Download here:  https://www.sendspace.com/file/0no55s   File is clean:  https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/074c27e3ea31f3e78ec9050a5640250b9419b4c18f87f8da2ace90a394961f1f/analysis/1416359722/  At 386 lines of very readable Python code, you can check it to be sure it makes no use of networking, system files, or anything else. Safe and very convenient! ",""

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","5149.0","2014-12-01T03:32:48","Public Key Testing Area","Start Here/For Beginners"," Here's your key, unmangled....  Some thoughts on key generation/labeling:   1) 4096-bit keys are to be preferred. 2048-bit keys are expected to be good until about 2030; 4096-bit keys are expected to be good for another 10-15 years after that. Today's hardware is fast enough such that there is no excuse for using smaller keys.   2) Label your keys appropriately, please!   One of the biggest mistakes that people make is in not labeling their keys appropriately. I am assuming that the key below belongs to you, rgb. The problem with this key, is that there is nothing on there which leads me to believe that this key belongs to you. A week from now (or a month from now) I'm not going to be able to remember who this belongs to.   This is a literal nightmare for vendors, or for anyone else who has a LOT of keys on their PGP keyring. (The average vendor will probably have dozens, to hundreds.) They're going to have the exact same problem.   Some of them are going to solve this problem by creating lists of customer names/IDs ids and PGP Key-IDs -- not a practice to encourage, by any means.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","5149.0","2015-04-26T11:25:35","Public Key Testing Area","Start Here/For Beginners"," I don't know what the purpose is of posting a PGP-encrypted message block... as the name implies, it is a message, as opposed to a PGP public key.    As a general rule, you cannot search for and/or import PGP keys for other people, as most people do not upload their keys to a PGP keyserver.  To enable you to test this function, I have uploaded my PGP key to the pgp.mit.edu keyserver, which I believe is the default keyserver in GPG4USB.  Accordingly, to retrieve my key, you can search for my key by: clicking on Import Keys --> Keyserver. When the search dialog comes up, enter the search string Zaphod@TheHub. (Searching for Zaphod will yield over 180 keys, so use the more specific search term.)   If you want to import a PGP key for someone here the easiest way to do that is to click on their Forum username, which will bring up their profile. If they have posted a PGP key as part of their profile. You just have to cut and paste it into the editor pane of GPG4USB.   N.B.: You may have to remove the indentation (4 spaces) that the Forum software places at the beginning of each line, before the key will import. You may have to use another text editor e.g. gedit on Linux or NoteTab on Windows to more easily remove this indentation.   Another thing to watch out for is that you have to have exactly five (5) dashes in the -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and  -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- lines. If even one dash is missing, you will get an error.

"The Hub Forums","hackerjon","8968.0","2015-05-13T17:54:08","How people get busted using tor.","General Discussion/Security","I'm trying to post my way out of the beginners board, so I might as well post some useful shit. I didn't write this. I found it on the clearnet, by someone named ""cyber hydra"".  Its a summary of a defcon talk about people getting fucked using tor. Nothing groundbreaking here, but...fuck it.  Dropping Docs On Darknets: How People Got Caught  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dropping+Docs+On+Darknets:+How+People+Got+Caught  This is Adrian Crenshaw's Defcon 22 talk, in a nut shell. You may find it here.  Crenshaw discusses the ways in which one could keep his/her anonymity through the cyphernet  [anonymizing networks such as tor, ...and others like it] by taking heed of certain mistakes made by Eldo Kim [harvard bomb threat], Hector Xavier Monsegur (Sabu) and Jeremy Hammond [LulzSec], Eric Eoin Marques [Freedom Hosting],  and Ross Ulbricht [The Silk Road]. First, I will summarize there mistakes. Then, I will list the lessons learned.  Eldo Kim [harvard bomb threat]:  Eldo makes a bomb threat to Harvard's student news paper and some other Harvard officials. Of all the reasons under the sun to do something like this his was that he wanted to get out of a final exam!? Maybe if we put our heads together we could come up with a less incriminating way to get out of a final exam. Less  incriminating, meaning no prison time if caught [âIMG] Though he uses tor to send the threat via email, all tor  exit nodes are publicly listed. Unless you use a tor bridge, bridges are not publicly listed as tor nodes,  you will give the authorities an obvious starting point from which to launch there investigation.   But that's not the worst mistake, it gets better. He connects to tor through his student account.  Because of this fact and the fact that he was the only one connected to tor at the time the email was sent it was easy for them to correlate that he may have sent the threat. As if that wasn't enough, Eldo puts the  final nail in his own coffin by actually admitting that he was the one who made the bomb threat.   More Details: http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/12 â¦ x-suspect/ http://www.scribd.com/doc/192371742/Kim-El-Do-Harvard  Lessons Learned from Eldo:  1) Don't be the only person using Tor on a monitored network at a given time  2) Use a bridge  3) DON'T ADMIT ANYTHING   4) Correlation attacks are a bitch  *Note: Watch out for DNS leaks*  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Hector Xavier Monsegur (Sabu) and Jeremy Hammond (sup_g) [LulzSec]:  Hector was already being watched by the FBI. However, his mistake was that he became laxidaisical.  Slipping up, he connected to IRC without tor, when he normaly would. This allowed the FBI to get his home IP address. He sang like a caged canary after being cought, and then proseeded to setup his cohert [Jeremy Hammond]. Jeremy, otherwise known as sup_g, when speaking with Hector on IRC spoke carelessly of places he had previously  been arrested and other groups that he was involved with. The FBI used this information to narrow their suspect pool and allowed them to obtain a court order to monitor his internet traffic.  Once again correlation proves to be a bitch [âIMG] I say this because although the FBI did not  exploit tor to bust Jeremy they were, however, able to correlate the times 'sup_g' spoke with 'Sabu' on IRC with  when Jeremy was at home using his computer.  More Details: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012 â¦ cago-anon/  Lessons Learned from LulzSec:  1) Use Tor consistently  2) Don't give personal information  3) Correlation attacks are still a bitch!   *Note: Be careful what you do and say from your home network*  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Eric Eoin Marques [Freedom Hosting]:  Freedom Hosting was known for hosting child pornography. This is enough to make you a mark for all sorts. In fact, Freedom had already been under attack from Anonymous during Op Darknet because of the child porn. The FBI was able to compromise Freedom because they were using an outdated version, 17 ESR, of tor browser. This allowed the FBI to exploit bug CVE-2013-1690. Mind you, tor had already came out with a patch, but for some reason Eric did not think it important to update.   The FBI used a payload called Magneto that gave them Freedom's IP address, MAC address, and Windows host name with the unique serial number that ties a user to a site visit. One of, if not the, biggest mistake(s) he made was leaving a trail of payment records that linked him directly to the Freedom Hosting servers. The important thing to generalize in this case is that he probably wouldn't have got busted if he didn't host child porn in any form, or fashion. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, when the cops busted him he ""dived"" for his laptop to shut it down.

Apparently, Mr. Ulbricht had linked himself to this onion on more than one occasion. In an effort, I believe, to market his site [The Silk Road] he would post around in clear net forums. The earliest references to  ""Silk Road"" that the FBI could find over the clear net was a post made in a shroomery forum by a user going under the name of altoid. In fact, Ulbricht's habits almost made correlating a none essential.   The FBI claims the former physics and engineering student  even publicly alluded to his alleged criminal enterprise  on his LinkedIn profile, with a statement describing how  his goals had ""shifted"" in accordance with his libertarian  economic views since leaving grad school at Pennsylvania  State University.  This statement comes from a CNN web site under an article titled  ""How FBI caught Ross Ulbricht, alleged creator of criminal marketplace Silk Road."" Of the other sites where the FBI found him marketing his site BitCoinTalk was one of them. With all of the effort he puts behind making sure that people knew how to get to The Silk Road, by explaining how too use tor and then by posting the link,  as if the explanation wasn't enough, to his site. He makes it hard for me not to believe that he may be suspect. What makes it even worst is that Ulbricht's BitCoinTalk account handle was also altoid. He makes the very same mistake yet  again by posting in the same forum [BitCoinTalk] a request for a ""pro"" IT guy, under an account also named altoid, and routing all replies to ""rossulbritcht at gmial dot.com."" The request was titled ""IT pro venture backed bitcoin startup.""  The list goes on. He made little to no effort in shedding the connections between his true identity and the  one with which he operated The Silk Road [Dread Pirate Roberts]. For instance, Dread Pirate Roberts had a link to the Mises Institute as part of his Silk Road forum signature and Ulbricht's Google+ profile show that he's also inter- ested in the Mises Institue. He did stuff like this time and time again, like using tor to connect to StackOverflow and creating an account using his real name. Notice, he posted the operating system he uses, ""ubuntu.""  This is getting redundant so I think I'll stop here and just list what we can learn from Mr. Ulbricht. If you want to  read in detail you can find slides and video here.  Basically, he made a plethora of connections to his real identity. He would go as far as the neighborhood Starbucks or library, which was rite around the corner from his house, to logon to and administrate his Silk Road onion. The US Customs had intercepted all of his fake ID's, because although he changed his name on his id cards he never changed his face them. It was mistakes like these that lead to his arrest and the take down of The Silk Road.

This should be stickied on the ""Security"" sub. Using bridges is something I myself have forgotten to do many of times. Or maybe it was I came to the conclusion that using bridges arouses more suspicion since you're going the extra mile. That and other than TOR's own URL giving up bridges, who's to say those bridges are not nefarious or LE or have been manipulated on that URL page so as to lead you elsewhere like phishing? Thanks for the update, in the end, everyone should master using Tails AFAIK.  I've also heard to avoid visiting any surface net url's on TOR so as to leave little trace of your activity.    Powering down the device is also good OPSEC, fuck it take the battery out while you're at it just in case, and not even using your own ISP is even better.  Make a device that can pick up a neighbours or a public wifi spot IMO.

There are no membership fees, you don't have to be referred or anything like that.  Anonymous' slogan(one of them) is ""United as one, divided by zero."", dividing by zero is impossible, what they mean to say is that there is no leader. Anonymous is anarchical.

Anonymous DID tip the FBI off about who the admin was. The FBI cyber-fucks wrote an exploit that took advantage of Firefox. Here's a quote:  ""Although the vulnerability affects users of Firefox 21 and below the exploit targets only ESR-17 users. Since this attack was found on Tor hidden services presumably that is because the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) is based on Firefox ESR-17. Users running the most recent TBB have all the fixes that were applied to Firefox ESR 17.0.7 and were also not at risk from this attack.""  You can find the code for the actual exploit here: (clearnet) http://tsyrklevich.net/tbb_payload.txt  The exploit is called Magneto. This article tells the whole story. (clearnet) https://xerocrypt.wordpress.com/tag/magneto/  The FBI wrote it, but they didn't have the resources to resolve the IP's that it discovered, so they actually got help from the NSA.  If you look at the court transcripts about Sabu, etc. you see that Sabu was giving 0day exploits to the Anonymous hackers, which is what they were using to accomplish all of their hacks in the early days. We now know that the exploits that Sabu was giving them were being written by FBI researchers.  Too much involvement with the cops for my taste, at least early on. These days, it seem like they do very much other than DDoS shit every now and then.  Besides, I can't be a member, cuz we all know I don't use IRC very much!",""

That's what surprises me -- guys forgetting to use Tor to log onto IRC, or Ross changing his email address on a forum and thinking that protects him... you have to be paranoid to do illegal shit.  It comes with the territory.  If you get too comfortable or forget your opsec, even once, that could be all it takes.  Maybe women are better at that kind of stuff by nature.  After all, life is more dangerous for us in many ways, so we tend to be more grounded than men.    What doesn't surprise me is when people start to confess things about themselves like that guy did about his arrests.  We all have a strong need to connect with other people, and LE relies on that to doxx us.  Its just so human and they prey on it.  If you ever feel the urge to get confessional save it for your clearnet presence.  The darknet is NOT the place.   ","Or maybe it was I came to the conclusion that using bridges arouses more suspicion since you're going the extra mile."

"The Hub Forums","Ava","5659.0","2014-10-31T16:53:09","Is Javascript going to expose you??","Start Here/For Beginners"," The last bit, that they require use of Windows7 is what I'd be most worried about.  Javascript, on its own, is not going to betray your real IP.  It has to be in conjunction with some unpatched bug in the browser/operating system code.  You can read up on the Freedom Hosting NSA hack for more info on how that can work, but the basics are that a particular stale Torbrowser version with an older Firefox version included, running on Windows(not sure if version specific), was able to be compromised using a javascript hack so the browser ""phoned home"" outside the Tor architecture.  Now its possible that hack would've failed to reveal the local network IP if OpenVPN was also running but personally I don't want just a VPN between me and the NSA.  In short, I'd avoid any site that won't let you use the browser and OS of your choice to access it, period.  But if you can use the latest Torbrowser on a non-windows OS but you need javascript turned on I'd say you're reasonably safe.","I have read that some websites can track your real IP by sending ping when you have your javascript turned on. Anyone have any ideas if this is true?If true, can they track you with this method even if you are setting up VPN (host) -----> Tor (VM)----->socks ----> target website?Most of the needed websites in the carding business require their clients to brows/login by using a regular browser with javascript enabled, sometimes even need it to be a win7 OS. In cases like these, wouldn't be really dangerous if LE can track you down with a ping?"

One of my favorite tools when conducting pentests was the Browser Exploitation Framework (beefproject.com). Basically, you hook the user with javascript and hook their browser. From there you can start keylogging, inject code into pages, steal passwords, inject a meterpreter shell and start using Metasploit features, and a WHOLE lot more.

The prosecution was asking for a 12-1/2 year sentence, while Nash's attorney asked that he be sentenced to time-served.  Now, one of the defining characteristics of the American ""justice"" system is its' utter lack of compassion, and even cruelty, towards those who fall into its clutches.   When I read that the prosecution was asking for a 12-1/2 year sentence, I was floored. In Canada, the U.K., Australia, and most other jurisdictions, the maximum sentence generally imposed (except for murder) is 14 years. Furthermore, this 14-year sentence is usually meted out only for the most  violent offenses and, even then, usually only to repeat offenders. To my eyes, then, the prosecution request for a 12-1/2 year sentence was, to put it mildly, insane.   Thankfully, the judge showed Nash some compassion, sentencing him to time served, as his attorney had requested.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","9379.0","2015-05-27T04:19:43","Peter Nash (SSBD) sentenced today","General Discussion/Legal"," The short answer is: Because they can. The criminal ""justice"" system in the United States is  beyond corrupt. Noted criminal defense attorney and civil liberties lawyer Harvey A. Silverglate wrote a book titled, ""Three Felonies A Day - How the Feds Target the Innocent"".   â[Three Felonies a Day] argues that federal criminal law is so comprehensive and vague that all Americans violate it every day, meaning prosecutors can indict anyone at all.â   -- Adam Liptak, The New York Times  âTechnology exacerbates the problem of laws so open and vague that they are hard to abide by, to the point that we have all become potential criminals. Boston civil-liberties lawyer Harvey Silverglate calls his new book âThree Felonies a Day,â referring to the number of crimes he estimates the average American now unwittingly commits because of vague laws.â  -- L. Gordon Crovitz, The Wall Street Journal  As the case of Peter Nash has proven, it's not  just Americans who get fucked-over. Just ask Richard O'Dwyer. O'Dwyer ran a site called TVShack. It was a site that indexed where various TV shows could be found. It was little different than Google or Yahoo, in that respect. Before setting up the site, O'Dwyer consulted with British attorneys, to ensure he was not violating any U.K. laws -- they told him he wasn't. So, here you have a kid who never even so much as set foot in the United States, and the United States is trying to prosecute him for breaking American laws. (I trust you see the parallels with the Nash case.)  The Americans' policy appears to be that, if you use a computer, particularly one connected to the Internet, you are therefore subject to American criminal laws -- irrespective of the fact that you do not live in America, and may never even have set foot there -- and as a result, be dragged halfway around the world to face ""justice"" in American courts.    Like, who the fuck do they think they are, anyway?    They fall under those statutes because the  prosecutors say they do, and they got a Grand Jury (or a judge) to sign-off on those charges. There is an old saying in America:    ""The Grand Jury will indict a ham sandwich if the prosecutor tells them to.""   Prosecutors in America have so much power, that not even  sitting state governors are immune to malicious prosecution. Just read about the case of Don Siegelman, sentenced to 6-1/2 years in prison -- the judge was an old political enemy of Siegelman's. The case literally stinks to high heaven, yet the courts have upheld the conviction. If a sitting governor of an American state isn't safe, then who in God's name  is?   See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegelman  See also: http://www.donsiegelman.org/  See also: http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obama-pardon-don-siegelman  Zaphod ","I don't understand how they even charged him with the shit they charged him with? ;In May 2011, the U.S. Justice Department sought to extradite O'Dwyer from the UK in relation to the website. The site did not host any infringing media, but American authorities say it contained indexed links to media hosted on other sites, and defined it as a ""linking"" website.[1][2] The Southern District Court in New York charged O'Dwyer with conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and criminal infringement of copyright. Richard O'Dwyer's lawyers opposed extradition, stating that the site acted as a mere conduit, and should be afforded the same protection given to search engines such as Google and Yahoo!. In addition, his lawyers argued that any criminal prosecution should be brought in the UK, as TVShack was not hosted on American servers. On 13 January 2012, UK District Judge Quentin Purdy rejected those arguments and ruled that O'Dwyer could be extradited to the U.S. to face copyright infringement allegations. The extradition order was approved by UK Home Secretary Theresa May in March, 2012, and O'Dwyer launched an appeal.On 28 November 2012, it was announced that O'Dwyer had signed a deferred prosecution agreement to avoid extradition. He was ordered to pay a fine of Â£20,000 and remain in contact with a US correctional officer over the next six months. In return, the US would drop all charges.[3] ;conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking and money laundering. How the fuck was operating a FORUM! fall under those charges? There are no drugs traded on the forums, and there sure as shit wasn't money being moved there either, so tell me how did they even charge him with that shit? "

The Tor project provides individuals with a mechanism of       communicating anonymously on the Internet. Furthermore, Tor is capa-       ble of providing anonymity to servers, which are configured to receive       inbound connections only through Torâmore commonly called hidden       services. In order to route requests to these hidden services, a namespace       is used to identify the resolution requests to such services. A namespace       under a non-delegated (pseudo) top-level-domain (TLD) of .onion was       elected. Although the Tor system was designed to prevent .onion requests       from leaking into the global DNS resolution process, numerous requests       are still observed in the global DNS. In this paper we will present the       state of .onion requests received at the global public DNS A and J root       nodes, potential explanations of the leakage, and highlights of trends as-       sociated with global censorship events. By sharing this preliminary work,       we wish to trigger further discussions on the matter in the community.        Keywords: DNS, privacy, security, Tor   1   Introduction The Domain Name System (DNS) has become a critical and reliable component of the Internet, allowing individuals to quickly match domain names with their corresponding IP-addresses. The DNS is a hierarchical system, in which at the top of the hierarchy is the root domain. Currently, the root consists of a com- bination of 13 groups of DNS servers located globally around the world. Each of those servers is named in the form [A-M].root-servers.net. These roots are responsible for the delegation of top-level-domains (TLDs) such as .com [1].     It is well known within the Internet research and engineering community that many installed systems on the Internet query the DNS root for a wide range of TLDs that are not delegated and will ultimately result in an error, or more commonly referred to as a NXDomain [2]. Many of these installed systems depend explicitly or implicitly on the indication from the global DNS that the domain name does not exist. For instance, many internal networks use a domain name suffix that is not currently delegated in the global DNS, such as .corp .home [3]. Due to the recent delegation of new gTLDs within the global DNS [4], several studies have measured the amount of internal name space leakage to the DNS roots [5, 6]. These unintended leaked DNS queries have been shown to expose sensitive private information and present potential new security threat vectors [5â7]. During the analysis of potential colliding name spaces within the global DNS, queries suffixed in .onion appeared to be one of the more prevalent non-delegated TLDs at the global root DNS.     Tor is an example of a system that exploits the absence of a non-delegated namespace within the global DNS system for its internal use. Hidden services, a unique feature within Tor, provide additional anonymity for users to communi- cate with servers. To identify these services, Tor uses the .onion name space to identify such requests [8]. While the Tor system was designed to not route re- quests suffixed in .onion, there exists a clear conflict of interests between internal namespace routing and the global DNS namespace when .onion URLs are shared and or requested [9]. In fact, DNS leakage is a known and well-documented is- sue within the Tor community. Many tutorials on the Tor website have been published giving users instructions to mitigate the leakage through the use of proxies, disabling DNS pre-fetching within the browser or even installing a local DNS server which rejects .onion addresses [10]. However, non-technical Tor users likely do not practice these mitigation steps due to their complicated nature.     The leakage of .onion requests to the global DNS roots clearly presents some risk to Tor users and also has privacy implications that need to be explored. To this end, in this paper we present a first look at the .onion leakage at the DNS root. We use two root servers, A and J, that are operated by Verisign, and explore .onion resolutions seen at both of them over a period of time close to six months. Our findings highlight that a large amount of .onion traffic is observed at both servers and the requests originate from a diverse set of locations (at the recursive name server level). Furthermore, we illustrate .onionâs heavy tailed distribution (with respect to the number of queries per .onion), and a very interesting weekly traffic pattern. We highlight various causes and scenarios of the leakage and call for further investigation into the leakage potential implication on users privacy.     The organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we in- troduce the DNS profile of the .onion data collected. In section 3, we examine longitudinal patterns of .onion traffic to the A and J root servers operated by Verisign from various network and second-level-domain (SLD) points-of-view, and highlight correlations between global events and increased .onion traffic vol- umes. In section 4, we explore potential reasons .onion traffic is being leaked to the roots and highlight considerations within the Internet engineering com- munity to address the use of non-delegated TLDs. Finally, in section 5 we will present our conclusions and discuss future directions in which we will further explore the .onion leakage.   2    Data Set  Verisign operates the A and J root servers in the DNS root zone. NXDomain (NXD) responses for the non-delegated TLD .onion were captured over slightly more than six months from both root servers starting on September 10th, 2013 and ending March 31st, 2014. The data set consists of approximately 27.6 million NXD records spanning 81,409 unique SLDs. The DNS requests originated from a wide variety of sources: in total, they are sent from 172,170 IP addresses, 105,772 unique /24 net blocks, and 21,345 distinct Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).     During the multi-month collection period, numerous NXD TLDs appeared at the roots. Based on the total query volume, we ranked the various TLDs and found that the .onion TLD ranked 461 out of 13.8 billion TLDs. The following section will further depict the traffic patterns and trends observed within the .onion TLD.   3     ""Onion"" DNS Trends and Characteristics  3.1   Traffic Volume and Diversity Measurements  To better understand the overall traffic pattern, a longitudinal study of query volumes including the total number of requests, number of distinct /24 net blocks and the number of distinct ASNs for a given day was conducted, and the results are represented in Figure 1. Overall, we observe that there is a clear upward trend in the total query traffic volume, increasing nearly 300% since the beginning of the collection period. Meanwhile, the diversity of the traffic sources also increased by approximately 20%. One common characteristic that many DNS researchers and network operators are familiar with is the weekly repeated pattern of the volume of requests, as shown in the ASN and /24 measures in Figure 1. These patterns and trends are clear in "".onionâs"" /24 and the ASN-level measurements; however, this weekly pattern is surprisingly absent when observing .onion total traffic volume. Many other NXD TLDs at the root have been shown to exhibit a regular weekly query volume pattern [11]. It is unclear to us at this time why .onion does not exhibit this common traffic pattern, and that warrants additional investigation to understand this phenomenon.     The data presented in Figure 1 only represents measurements taken from the A and J root nodes. In order to gauge the total global DNS leakage of "".onion"" requests, we can segregate the unique SLDs received at each root node and compare their overlap. This measure will provide us with a SLD root affinity and a simple way of estimating total global DNS leakage if this trend was to be extrapolated over all roots.     Figure 2 depicts the number of unique SLDs observed at the A node, J node, and the combination of A and J nodes. In this figure, we can see that the com- bined A+J roots, on a daily basis, observe about 3300 unique SLDs; while each of the A and J nodes separately observe roughly 2500 unique SLDsâroughly 75% of the combined A+J root nodes. Prior work studying multi-root distinct SLD overlap [11] has shown that the combined traffic observed at A+J constitutes approximately 40% of all observed distinct SLDs for various TLDs spanning the global DNS roots. The .onion SLD root affinities and overlap between the A and J roots are comparable to the finding in the prior literature concerning other        Fig. 1. ""Onion"" Traffic Measurements Observed at A and J Root DNS Nodes   TLDs [11]. Therefore, we postulate that the .onion traffic observed at A+J would continue such a trend and an appropriate sizing of total global .onion leakage could be roughly estimated. Based on the statistics in section 2, we estimate the total number of .onion NXD records at 69 million over the same period of time. 3.2        Hidden Service and Second Level Domain Measurements  Figure 2 shows a few days in which the absolute number of distinct SLDs dra- matically increases from the average number of daily SLDs observed in the rest of the measurement period. We now turn our attention to the overall distribution of requests for a given SLD within the .onion TLD to better understand the DNS request dynamics of all .onion SLDs. Figure 3 provides three diâµerent plots of various traffic diversity measurements, namely the number of total requests, the count of distinct /24 net blocks, and ASNs a distinct SLD received during the collection period. The corresponding cumulative distributions of these measures are reflected in Figure 3.     Clearly, the vast majority of SLDs receive a minimal amount of DNS requests over the six months period covered in our data set, with 50% of the SLDs re- ceiving only one request and nearly 90% of SLDs receiving less than 10 requests. A similar trend of minimal traffic source diversity for the majority of SLDs is displayed, where nearly 95% of the SLDs originate from fewer than 10 distinct ASNs; leaving very few SLDs with large amounts of traffic from a wide variety of              Fig. 2. Global DNS Estimation of Onion By Root  network locations. This pattern is in line with the general traffic characteristics and trend for other non-delegated TLDs.     Next we shift our focus to those few but very popular SLDs within the .onion TLD. Table 1 provides a list of the most requested hidden services along with their total percentage of .onion traffic and the type of service provided using them. The mapping of SLDs to their type of service was constructed manually by searching for references of the hidden service online. The SLDs listed in the table have been anonymized (masked) for privacy concerns, where the first and last two characters of each SLD are shown.              Rank Anonymized SLD     Type of Service Traffic (%)             1 Z6---------43        Hidden Tracker     26.5             2 DK---------II         Silk Road                2.1             3 DP---------PC       TorDir                     1.7             4 SI---------FK        Silk Road                1.4             5 3G---------4M       Search Engine       1.3             6 JH---------JX         Tor Mail                   1.2             7 XM---------SL       Search Engine        1.1             8 AG---------WW    Agora Marketplace  1.1             9 FO---------UI       Bitcoin                     0.9            10 TO---------NS     TorLinks                   0.9   Table 1: Most Popular SLD Hidden Services and Their Traffic Measurements                          Fig. 3. Cumulative Distribution of SLD Traffic Measurements in ""Onion""       From the statistics shown in Table 1, we observe that nearly 27% of all .onion traffic belongs to one hidden service whose focus is on Torrent tracking. The remaining traffic forms a long tailed distribution over the remaining hidden services with an emphasis on services surrounding search, commerce and cur- rency exchange. The top 10 hidden services shown in Table 1 account for more than 38% of the traffic observed over the total period of time of our data set.   3.3         Traffic Source Measurements  In Tables 2, we examine the origination of the .onion DNS requests issued by recursive name servers to the A and J roots from an ASN and country perspec- tive.     The geographical distribution of .onion requestors deviates from the Top-10 countries by directly connecting users as reported by the Tor project over the same period of time. At nearly 36%, the US is 3 times higher than reported from Tor. Other countries such as Germany, France, and Spain also diâµered significantly, with 7.7%, 7.23% 6.17% and 4.8% respectively [12]. While clearly leaked .onion queries to the global DNS roots and actual Tor connections are very diâµerent (e.g. measuring recursive name servers vs. direct connections), the variance in the distribution of the .onion requests may prove helpful in understanding the root cause of the leaked DNS queries.    Country Code Requests % Traffic          Autonomous System Requests %Traffic   US           9878093        35.7         AS15169         2267250       8.2   RU           2213691        8.0          AS7922            1222955       4.4   DE           1482075        5.3          AS7018            654680        2.3   BR           1258468        4.5          AS36692          571609        2.0   CN           996130          3.6          AS30607          561349        2.0   GB           984059          3.5          AS4766            560739        2.0   KR           980656          3.5          AS701              512989        1.8   PL           918948          3.3          AS7132            447528        1.6   CA           785184         2.8          AS22773           400657        1.4   FR           670103          2.4          AS6830            392233        1.4   AU           510745         1.8          AS20115           342716        1.2   NL           454441         1.6          AS3786            326885        1.1   ES           448171         1.6          AS28573           309751        1.1   IE           425469          1.5          AS5617            290577        1.0   IT           423550          1.5          AS3356            290160        1.0   AR           387594         1.4          AS7738            284726        1.0   MX           363389        1.3          AS22773           273845        0.9   IN           295122         1.0          AS4134            258832        0.9        Table 2: Top Geographical Countries and ASNs Requesting ""Onion""        With such a large percentage of .onion requests originating in the United States, it is not surprising to observe the major Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Table 2. However, it is interesting to observe that nearly 8% of all .onion traffic originates from AS15169 (Google). We hypothesize that users/advocates of Tor would most likely not use their default ISP name servers and instead would choose to use public DNS providers such as Google Public DNS or OpenDNS (AS36692, which has a share of 2.06%).    3.4   Global Event Correlation   Global events, such as Internet censorship, political reform, and economic shifts, among others, spur the use of privacy enhancing technologies like Tor. The total traffic volume measured on a daily basis in Figure 1 exhibits several spikes in which .onion traffic significantly increases from its moving average. In order to better understand these events, we cross-correlated the spikes with news stories on global events. Table 3 lists the events and their impact on .onion traffic. These events typically manifest themselves in the form of increased traffic from a specific geographical region or the predominance of queries for a particular SLD. Figure 4 plots the events listed in Table 3 against the total daily "".onion"" traffic volume, highlighting the spikes in relation with the rest of the traffic volume over the entire period of time observed in our data set.          Event             Date       Requests      Event         A                 10/03/13   156312        Silk Road Shutdown [13]         B                 10/24/13   134236        TorATM Traffic Spike [14]         C                 10/27/13   154855        URL Posted on Reddit [15]         D                 11/07/13   126398        New Silk Road URL [16]         E                 12/15/13   138231        Pirate Bay URL Posted [17]         F                 03/21/14   303347        Multiple URLs Posted on Reddit [18]        Table 3: Global Events and Elevated ""Onion"" Request Correlation         Fig. 4. Global Events and Elevated ""Onion"" Request Correlation       Certain global events such as the censorship of Internet domains in Turkey may span a longer period of time than a few days. Figure 5 depicts the number of requests for .onion domains originating from Turkey over the multi-month collection period. There is a clear upward trend and a sudden increase in the second half of March 2014 when many DNS-based censorship events took place. The requests originating from Turkey during the censorship spanned hundreds of unique SLDs and were spread over several ASNs.   4   Root Cause Exploration and Namespace Management Applications electing to use non-delegated TLDs as a namespace in which they seed their routing and resolution processes face scenarios in which possible DNS leakage may occur. Tor has been specifically designed to prevent .onion requests from leaking within the application into the global DNS infrastructure. However,            Fig. 5. ""Onion"" Traffic Measurements From Turkey   it is clear from the measurements we presented so far that a significant volume of requests are being issued to the global DNS root servers. Whether they are initiated by users by mistake or caused by a misconfiguration in the underlying application, such as Tor, or the web browsers, leaked DNS queries outside of the Tor network have a significant implication to individualsâ privacy and safety. To that end, understanding the causes of the leakage may help reducing the risk at the user side.     There are many plausible reasons or mechanisms in which .onion queries could be generated and observed in the global public DNS; however, the root cause of how and why these queries are being requested within the global DNS remains unclear. We have seen in this paper numerous global events that spurred additional query volume. One potential explanation associated with surge in the volume of .onion domains in those times is users errors, in which users are not aware that the addresses of hidden services should be run on top of Tor (i.e., by first installing Tor plug-in associated with the browser). Other notable explanations may include browser prefetching, third party application or plug- ins, DNS suffix search lists, web crawlers, and malware.    Advanced families of malware are also now utilizing Tor within their Com- mand and Control (C&C) infrastructure. Cyber-criminals may use Tor and its Hidden Services in order to avoid detection and prevent takedowns. Several cyber-criminals have now started actively using Tor to host malicious infras- tructure via Hidden Services. Variants of Zeus [19], CyrptoLocker [20], Chew- Bacca [21], CryptorBit [22] and Torec [23] have all been found to use various aspects of the Tor network, including hidden services. Possible misconfigurations within these malware pieces could facilitate a percentage of the leaked DNS re- quests. To that end, we observed numerous requests for .onion SLDs associated with these malware samples during our analysis.     Focus within the Internet Engineering community has recently increased on ways for applications to properly use non-delegated domains. A recent Internet draft describes several special-use domain names of peer-to-peer name systems and is seeking approval from the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) [9]. Discussions about the proposal on the DNS operators mailing list have brought forth other generic solutions such as proposed .alt alternative TLD in which ap- plications would safe anchor namespace under it [24]. Blurred lines of authority, privacy and security makes solving such a namespace problem difficult to solve and appease all parties.   5   Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we looked at a sample of .onion DNS requests issued to the A and J root nodes of the global DNS infrastructure. We examined the unique char- acteristics of these requests longitudinally as well as the dynamics of requests received from a geographical and network location for unique SLDs. We found that increased traffic spikes within the global DNS for .onion requests corre- sponded with external global events, highlighting the potential human factor in those leakages (i.e., user error). While the root cause of these leaked DNS queries remains unknown, our preliminary investigation unveiled concerns to the sever- ity of the leakage and to the possibility of more sensitive private information being unintentionally exposed. Our future work will continue the examination of leaked DNS queries to the root but will also extend to other non-delegated TLDs such as i2p and .exit. We will plan to further dissect the impact of global events and the role of malware in the leakage, and investigate the potential pri- vacy consequences of the leakage under the various leakage causes. By sharing this preliminary work, we wish to trigger further discussion in the community.   References  1. Mockapetris, P., Dunlap, K.J.: Development of the domain name system. Vol-     ume 18.

I would add the Articles of Confederation, since they were never repealed.  The Constitution only added another ""layer"" to ""perfect"" what was already Organic Law.  Really, the only book you need in addition to Black's is USC Title 1, which contains the 4 organic laws of the USA (DoI, AoC, OoNWT, Constitution).  I agree with a slight modification.  You don't want to be ""one of the people"", you want to be a ""free inhabitant"" (Art IV, AoC).  Keep in mind, LAW is LAW OF THE LAND - law exists only to the extent of the ownership of land.  On my land, I make the laws.  On your land, you make the laws.  The Constitution only applies to land owned by the federal govt (as well as all federal codes/statutes).  I generally agree, but I say it is more to the point to challenge territorial jurisdiction.  If you were not on federal land, then a federal agent has no business with you.  If you were not on state land, then the state has no business with you.  If you were not on county land, then those agents have no business with you.  Jurisdiction directly applies to ""who owns the land"".  On your property, nobody has any jurisdiction over you - and on public lands, the ""common law"" (do unto others ...) has jurisdiction.  It's very important to know who owns the land where something occurs, because whoever that is - they make the rules.  And if it's land in common (public), then only the common law applies.  And if people wonder where all this shit comes from - well, it just comes from the way Kings and people established law over time.  I would say Ed Rivera is a little closer to the truth    When the Revolution was over, there was no more King.  Only free inhabitants.  There were ""federal citizens"" shortly thereafter - if you were a member of federal govt or were born on federal land, you were a federal citizen.  It's always tied to the land.  ""National"" is really kind of a perverted word, and assumes the US is a nation, which it is not.  Not to mention that it is THEIR judicial system, the BAR system, and they own and control the system - which is used to extract monies from the ignorant dependents - and nothing else.  I generally agree with you, but would encourage more focus on land.  It's the LAW OF THE LAND, not law over everything and everyone.  The USA can't tell Germans what to do, because Germany is not land that is owned by the USA (or US for that matter).  LAW OF THE LAND  ","#1 Download 4th Edition of Blacks Law Dictionary#2 Read the Declaration of Independence and look up the definition of each word in Blacks Law.#3 Then Learn the Constitution#4 Start Reading Case Law.;There are many references to ""The People"", however, the way the establishment has taken over our country is dumbing the people down with a regular dictionary and educating them as if they are all 14th Amendment Citizens.  The 14th Amendment citizen was created after the civil war to give slaves legal status, because prior to that they were just property and had no rights.What is the benefit of being one of the people?  You are ""NOT SUBJECT"" to the statutory laws of ""the federal government or the states""!  This is not legal theory, this is FACT!;One very good reference of it is to look up a recent case decided in 2011, ""Bond vs.United STates"", you have to understand that YOU can invoke ""common law"" at any time if you know how to!  You are the tribunal, you are higher than the government.  This is a 100% fact, but you must learn how!  Everything is buy contract, when they get you to plea, they are getting you to consent that there ""color of laws"" are validated!  Never Plea, Always challenge ""subject matter jurisdiction""!  ;A good teacher of the procedure is Bill Thornton, his website is 1215.org, you can youtube his videos, a good one to get you started is the introduction to sovereignty, All anglo saxon Americans are sovereign.  The law is not that difficult to learn, if you don't enter the jurisdiction of the ""citizen""!  You have to remember that there were no national citizens until the 14th amendment.  There are many case laws, with Quotes from supreme court justices!  ;This is why the elite have an edge and seem to be above the law all the time, because they are, but they have the education to be."

PEOPLE  The Preamble does not specifically define the word ""People."" Nevertheless, the definition becomes apparent in the context of the other words and prior history. HISTORY  Before the United States existed, there was no legal government. A group of representatives, acting ""in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies,"" declared the independence of the colonies from the British Crown and the state of Great Britain.  From the beginning, in the 1776 Declaration of Independence, the people were acknowledged as the source of authority, i.e. the sovereignty which authorized the Declaration of Independence.  Next came the 1778 Articles of Confederation. The states that existed by the authority of the people, created those Articles while in Congress assembled. That didn't work as well as expected.  In 1787 the people themselves came forth ""to ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America"" [see Preamble]. On September 17th, 1787, the states held a convention and all those present unanimously joined in. [see last paragraph of U.S. Constitution]  So, in 1787, unanimous concurrence was achieved and the Constitution was born, later to be ratified.  PREAMBLE  ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""  STRUCTURE OF PREAMBLE  TRUSTOR: We the People [trustors]  VENUE: of the United States  PURPOSE: in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty  BENEFICIARY: to ourselves and our Posterity,  ENABLING ACTION 1: do ordain [declare the law]  ENABLING ACTION 2: and establish [bring into existence]  WHAT: this Constitution [articles of incorporation for trust]  TRUSTEE: for the United States of America. [trustee]  ANALYSIS OF PREAMBLE  The Preamble defines the context in which the remainder of the Constitution must be interpreted. Most of it is self explanatory. Here's an explanation that points to popular sovereignty:  After the Declaration of Independence, but before the ordainment and establishment of the Constitution, the people of the United States pretty much handled their own affairs using the common law. They were not subject to any higher authority other than the authority of the common law as administered by the people themselves (self governance). Although the states did exist, they only existed by the authority of the people. Every man was a king, and every woman a queen--and none had any subjects. Upon declaring our independence, we all became sovereigns and members of the peerage (nobility).  ""The people of this State, as the successors of its former sovereign, are entitled to all the rights which formerly belonged to the King by his prerogative. Through the medium of their Legislature they may exercise all the powers which previous to the Revolution could have been exercised either by the King alone, or by him in conjunction with his Parliament; subject only to those restrictions which have been imposed by the Constitution of this State or of the U.S.""  Lansing v. Smith, 21 D. 89., 4 Wendel 9 (1829) (New York) ""D."" = Decennial Digest Lansing v. Smith, 4 Wend. 9 (N.Y.) (1829), 21 Am.Dec. 89 10C Const. Law Sec. 298; 18 C Em.Dom. Sec. 3, 228; 37 C Nav.Wat. Sec. 219; Nuls Sec. 1`67; 48 C Wharves Sec. 3, 7. NOTE: Am.Dec.=American Decision, Wend. = Wendell (N.Y.)  The enabling actions in the Preamble are significant because there is simply nothing in the use of those words to imply that the People relinquished any of their own power and authority. The People declared the law (ordain) without taking away from themselves the authority to declare law again in the future. The People established the Constitution without taking away from themselves the authority to establish anything else in the future. In other words, the people gave birth to the Constitution without giving up any of their own power and authority.  What was before, continues to be so today.  From the context of the Preamble, one may conclude that the laws of the United States do not apply to People. The People, as ordainers and establishers of the country are sovereigns of the country, may not be involuntarily subjected to the laws of the United States.  Because of Amendment X (""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,"" the government has no authority, and cannot assume any authority over the People. Government powers may not reach beyond that which is constitutionally granted. In order for the government to subject People to its law it is necessary for the People to relinquish their sovereignty. Sovereignty is a natural right which cannot lawfully be relinquished involuntarily. Any removal of sovereignty must be accomplished voluntarily by the subject himself.  DEFINITION OF CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES HISTORY Before ratification of the Amendment XIV , there was no legal definition of the term ""citizen of the United States."" The term was used, but only generally. After the Civil War the slaves were freed but there was no legal basis to recognize them as having any rights. Amendment XIV partially solved that problem.  ""Free the slaves,"" was the rallying cry combined with the Civil War that resulted in Amendment XIV. Amendment XIV created a new class of person called ""citizen of the United States."" Any ex-slave could now claim citizenship, and, by the way, so could any of the People if they so chose to do. Amendment XIV made possible the voluntary relinquishment of personal sovereignty.  It was also during the mid 1800's that the various governments took control of the school systems. The curriculum shifted from civics (the study of natural rights and common law) to American government (the study of civil privileges and statutory law). Emphasis was also refocused on ""good citizenship"". To blunt the people's perception, the civil privileges were called civil rights. The transition from teaching ""natural rights"" to teaching ""civil rights"" took about 100 years (from the 1850's to the 1950's). During the 1950's the school systems changed the courses named from ""Civics"" to ""American Government."" Hardly anyone now is aware of the subject of civics as a school course.  The phrase, ""citizens of the United States,"" is defined in the Constitution for the United States of America, Amendment XIV:  AMENDMENT XIV  Section 1. ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  Section 5. ""The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.""  STRUCTURE OF AMENDMENT XIV  WHO: All persons  QUALIFICATION: (A) born or naturalized in the United States, and  (B) subject to the jurisdiction thereof  PURPOSE: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  ENFORCED BY: The Congress  ENFORCEMENT METHOD: Legislation  QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF AMENDMENT XIV  As discussed above, the People are sovereign. The People are not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal government, even though they are born in the United States.  Amendment XIV inverts the relationship. One of the qualifications to be a citizen of the United States is that one must be born or naturalized in the United States. Another qualification is that one must be, ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof."" It is not possible to be a citizen of the United States without being born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. But, if you are born or naturalized, and if you are subject to the jurisdiction, then you automatically qualify as a citizen of the United States.  From the point of view of the federal enforcers, the qualifications are worked in reverse. They reverse-interpret Amendment XIV as saying that if you say you are a citizen of the United States, then that automatically means you are totally subject to its jurisdiction [and have been born or naturalized]. This opinion is not shared by the judicial branch. See 14 C.J.S. 426, 430:  The particular meaning of the word ""citizen"" is frequently dependent on the context in which it is found[25], and the word must always be taken in the sense which best harmonizes with the subject matter in which it is used[26]. ""One may be considered a citizen for some purposes and not a citizen for other purposes, as, for instance, for commercial purposes, and not for political purposes[27]. So, a person may be a citizen in the sense that as such he is entitled to the protection of his life, liberty, and property, even though he is not vested with the suffrage or other political rights[28].  ""[25] Cal.--Prowd v. Gore, 2 Dist. 207 P. 490. 57 C.A. 458. [26] Cal.--Prowd v. Gore. 2 Dist. 207 P. 490. 57 C.A. 458.       La.--Lepenser v Griffin, 83 So. 839, 146 La. 584       N.Y.--Union Hotel Co. v.

Burton, 153 N.E. 13, 256 Mass. 568""  In any case, if you fail to object to the government's view of citizenship, then you will most certainly be subjected to the laws of the government. That means no rights, only privileges. To see a list of privileges granted or denied to the citizens (there is no list for the People's natural rights because the People automatically have all rights), see People's rights vs citizen's rights ONE OF THE PEOPLE OR ONE OF THE CITIZENS?  The first issue to be resolved in any court proceeding is that of jurisdiction. Does the one entity have jurisdiction over the other entity? One should never go into court without a clear understanding as to whether he is there as a citizen, or there as one of the people. If you claim you are a citizen of the United States, then it is strongly implied (though not necessarily true) that you are subject to the laws of the United States. On the other hand, if you are one of the People, then it is legally implied that you are a legal king, with a sovereignty superior to that of the United States, and subject only to the common law of the other kings (your peers). In short: the People are superior to the government, the government is superior to the citizens. That is the hierarchy.  PEOPLE ---> GOVERNMENT ---> CITIZENS As a king you ""are entitled to all the rights which formerly belonged to the King by his prerogative."" You can do what you want to do when you want to do it. You have your own property and your own courts. There is no limit as to what you may do other than the natural limits of the universe, and the sovereignty of a fellow sovereign. You should treat the other sovereign in accordance with the Golden Rule, and at the very least must never harm him. Your sovereignty stops where the other sovereignty begins. You are one of the owners of the American government, and it is their promise that they will support your sovereignty (i.e. they have promised to support the Constitution and protect it from all enemies). You have no allegiance to anyone. The government, your only [public] servant, has an allegiance to you. As a citizen, you are only entitled to whatever your sovereign grants to you. You have no rights. If you wish to do something that would be otherwise illegal, you must apply for a license giving you special permission. If there is no license available, and if there is no specific permission granted in the statutes, then you must apply for special permission or a waiver in order to do it. Your only allegiance is to your sovereign (the government), and that allegiance is mandated by your sovereign's law (the government, though not absolutely sovereign, is sovereign relative to you if you claim to be a citizen of the sovereign).  Here is a typical example:  As one of the People you have a right to travel, unrestricted, upon the public highways. You have right to carry guests with you in your automobile. You have a right to own a gun and that right shall not be impaired by your servant, the government. You have a right to a grand jury indictment and a trial by jury, that is a trial directly by the people, not the government.  As one of the citizens, you may not travel by automobile unless you are either a licensed motor vehicle driver, or you are a passenger with permission to be on board. Gun ownership is a privilege subject to definition and regulation. You do not have a right to a jury trial in all cases, and no right to grand jury indictment--a trial is a trial by the government, not the people.",""

Also, I think the TRIM maybe used when formatting a disk thus allowing the user to format the drive in seconds to minutes.   update: I just realized this, cell phones use flash memory so how would one securely implement FDE? I pretty sure cell phone NAND memory supports TRIM so it would have some problems as SSD. I ask because Apple and Google made big promises to implement FDE on all devices. I'm not sure if either company released implantation details.",""

Perhaps the only people buyers can place some trust in are the vendors who supply them with goods and services.  Finding an acceptable vendor can take many tries and involves the greatest exposure in the entire process, i.e. sending your name and address to multiple strangers in hopes of a inconspicuous package arriving is risky.  Finding a vendor you ""trust"" (to whatever extent) is valuable and convienent.  The aim of changing identities would be to break continuity of character and distance one's self from past transactions.  Thus, a reputation must be built from the ground up, frusturating buyers and the seller.  The utility is minimal.  A sizeable operation will, in a matter of weeks, have shipped enough drugs to put them in jail for life, just the same as an operation that has been continuous for years.  Unless a seller changes identity on a near-monthly basis and disregards reputation and customer loyalty alltogether (business suicide), changing keys is useless.

A ""super computer"" has duped humans into thinking it was a 13-year-old boy to become the first machine to pass the ""iconic"" Turing Test, experts say.  Five machines were tested at the Royal Society in central London to see if they could fool people into thinking they were humans during text-based conversations.  The test was devised in 1950 by computer science pioneer and World War II code breaker Alan Turing, who said that if a machine was indistinguishable from a human, then it was ""thinking"".  No computer had ever previously passed the Turing Test, which requires 30 per cent of human interrogators to be duped during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations, organisers from the University of Reading said.  But ""Eugene Goostman"", a computer program developed to simulate a 13-year-old boy, managed to convince 33 per cent of the judges that it was human, the university said.  Professor Kevin Warwick, from the University of Reading, said: ""In the field of artificial intelligence there is no more iconic and controversial milestone than the Turing Test.  ""It is fitting that such an important landmark has been reached at the Royal Society in London, the home of British science and the scene of many great advances in human understanding over the centuries. This milestone will go down in history as one of the most exciting.""  The successful machine was created by Russian-born Vladimir Veselov, who lives in the United States, and Ukrainian Eugene Demchenko who lives in Russia.  Veselov said: ""It's a remarkable achievement for us and we hope it boosts interest in artificial intelligence and chatbots.""  Professor Warwick said there had been previous claims that the test was passed in similar competitions around the world.  ""A true Turing Test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations,"" he said.  ""We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time.""  Professor Warwick said having a computer with such artificial intelligence had ""implications for society"" and would serve as a ""wake-up call to cybercrime"".  The event on Saturday was poignant as it took place on the 60th anniversary of the death of Turing, who laid the foundations of modern computing.  AAP",""

Us at TheCardShark are amongst the most experienced and have been members of the Financial Darknet community since the days of its birth. We are veterans in every variation of fraud, and most importantly in life. We understand that time changes  Sometimes the changes occurring, in our lives and to the world in its entirety, can be good. And then sometimes the changes are bad. Exactly about a decade ago, when the DarkNet was less prevelant in a world less technologically advanced, TheCardShark established itself as one of the Top 10 vendors in the world. During this time you would fire up your Tor Browser and find a lot less than you would today. The drug markets that Tor is most infamous for in todayâs present world, did not exist. If you were a user of the Tor Browser for the sole purpose of participating in the trade of illegal goods & services, then you were buyer/vendor in fraudulent/counterfeit good/services. In these golden days business was booming for us and obtaining a cloned credit card was as easy, safe, and convenient as it is to find, order, and receive the delivery a parcel containing your drug of choice (considering you use drugs.)  People possessing the alternative motive (like buying/selling/simply witnessing the existing the existence of the global darknet drug market) that led them to download and browse with Tor, that wasnât being/having a serious/legitimate interest in buying or selling cloned credit cards, stolen credit/debit card information, or any other illegal stimuli within the financial markets sector (in other words, people conducting activity that leads to them frequently being referred to as WASTES OF GLOBAL SPACE, PIECES OF FUC*ING SH*T âSCAMMERSâ), DID NOT EXIST.  As being a decade younger, and WHOLE LOT LESS WISE, we felt as the founders of this operation as if we were untouchable and couldnât fathom any event that would bring about the change that would lead to the decrease in demand of cloned cards that were loaded with exponentially more than the investment involved in purchasing them, in which utilizing would be 100% anonymous. HOWEVER, as weâd learn with growing, THINGS CHANGE. And as the drug markets came into existence and became ever-increasingly prevalent, along came the broke drug addicts who needed means to pay for their habit.  With the birth and growth of this new race came more & more skepticism in the legitimacy of cloned card vendors, cloned card vendors switching to other fraudulent practices, and then, what would now be referred to as, the death of this breed of darknet vendor.  Here, at TheCardShark, business is AS GOOD AS ITâS EVER BEEN. But the reason for this is our involvement in selling stolen personal, credit/debit card, and other personal information AND the loyal customer base we had established over these years that knew they were going get what they ordered EVERY time.

Wikimedia Commons  The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been planting surveillance software deep within hard drives made by top manufacturers, allowing it to eavesdrop on almost every computer in the world, according to Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based software security company that announced its findings Monday.  Kaspersky did not explicitly name from which country or intelligence agency the spying software was found, but former operatives from the NSA confirmed that the findings correlated with NSA activity, Reuters reported.  The NSAâs spyware lies within drives manufactured by Western Digital and Seagate, who deny that they had any knowledge of such programs. Samsung and Toshiba drives also contained the code, but both declined to comment.  equation-650-38010-260926 The NSA hacking team, called ""Equation group"" by Kaspersky, had infected computers with spyware since as early as 2001.  Kaspersky Lab  Kaspersky said that PCs in 30 different countries were infected by the most advanced hacking operation ever uncovered, with the most in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. The NSA has a number of ways in which it can obtain the drivesâ source code, which it requires to embed the spyware. The NSAâs methods include posing as software companies or asking for it directly, Reuters reported. The government can also request it for a security audit from manufacturers who wish to sell hard drives to the Department of Defense, and then use it to infect the manufacturerâs products.  The NSA also would intercept mailed items, such as CDs or USB drives, to infect them, according to a report from Ars Technica. The infections also affect iPhones and other Apple products.  The NSA is targeting a number of organizations, including government and military offices, telecommunication, energy and media companies as well as nuclear research facilities and Islamic activists. Institutions with infected hard drives should be able to detect the NSA spyware using technical details that Kaspersky published Monday.  Those details could impair the NSAâs surveillance programs, which were already affected by the revelations made by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The disclosures have already slowed sales of U.S. technology products internationally, especially in China.      Submit Correction    The correction should be if you are vending or purchasing to vend on the dark net  PULL THAT HARD DRIVE I remember reading a post EG made saying ""rip the hard drive out""           ",""

Step 3 : Get yourself a 4gb usb drive .  Step 4 : Open unetbootin and locate your Beini 1.2.5.iso file and then select the usb drive and then click on burn , it will take about 2-3mins depending on USB and computer speed .  Step 5 : Now that you have burned the iso to the usb turn off your computer . Insert the usb and then press whatever button brings you into the boot menu on your computer ( can be ESC , f8 , f10 )  Step 5 : select your usb to boot from , when it boots just use the default option to start beini .  Step 6 : When beini boots up the is a program at the bottom of the screen called minidwep , open that . Then on the left choose what networks your looking for ( wep or wpa ) and then click on scan .  Step 7 : It will now show a list of either wep or wpa , which ever you selected . If you choose wep and have a few networks click on one of them and then click on launch . It will now crack the wep network and give you the key ....... this can take anywhere from 3mins to 2 hours depending on the signal quality .  If you chose wpa and done the scan and you can see some networks that say WPS beside them then select one of them and then click on reaver in the menu , it will pop up with another box ..... just click on okay .  Reaver will now try and crack the network , this can take up to 2 days !  What reaver does is , WPS enabled routers means it has a pin of numbers to gain access to the router , the pin is 8 or 9 numbers long so reaver will start at 00000001 and work its way up until it gets the right pin .  Some routers have reaver blocking tools and wont allow more than 3 password attempts every 20 minutes so this could take weeks to crack the network .  As for wpa2 that is complicated and i am not going to explain that as kali linux is needed and you need to set monitor mode etc and other commands and also capture handshakes and sniff packets etc...... in other words its not simple .  ***************  The above OS will only work with certain wifi cards ! I suggest using an alfa 1000mw and also a 35 dbi antenna which can both be gotten off ebay , your standard laptop wireless card wont work ( well some do but there shit )  Reason why laptops card is not good enough is because they run at a power level of 50mw when an alfa works at 1000mw or 1 watt . This means you can pick up internets 1.5 miles away if you use a directional antenna .  ***************  When doing all this is suggest you buy a second hand laptop or build your own tower .    Hope that helps , that is the piss simple way to hack wifi !   Enjoy !!       FT  ",""

Zaphod   How Law Enforcement Tracks Cellular Phones A brief taxonomy of wiretapping esoterica.  http://www.crypto.com/blog/celltapping/  Recent news stories, notably this story in USA Today and this story in the Washington Post, have brought to light extensive use of ""Stingray"" devices and ""tower dumps"" by federal -- and local -- law enforcement agencies to track cellular telephones.  Just how how does all this tracking and interception technology work? There are actually a surprising number of different ways law enforcement agencies can track and get information about phones, each of which exposes different information in different ways. And it's all steeped in arcane surveillance jargon that's evolved over decades of changes in the law and the technology. So now seems like a good time to summarize what the various phone tapping methods actually are, how they work, and how they differ from one another.  Note that this post is concerned specifically with phone tracking as done by US domestic law enforcement agencies. Intelligence agencies engaged in bulk surveillance, such as the NSA, have different requirements, constraints, and resources, and generally use different techniques. For example, it was recently revealed that NSA has access to international phone ""roaming"" databases used by phone companies to route calls. The NSA apparently collects vast amounts of telephone ""metadata"" to discover hidden communications patterns, relationships, and behaviors across the world. There's also evidence of some data sharing to law enforcement from the intelligence side (see, for example, the DEA's ""Hemisphere"" program). But, as interesting and important as that is, it has little to do with the ""retail"" phone tracking techniques used by local law enforcement, and it's not our focus here.  Phone tracking by law enforcement agencies, in contrast to intelligence agencies, is intended to support investigations of specific crimes and to gather evidence for use in prosecutions. And so their interception technology -- and the underlying law -- is supposed to be focused on obtaining information about the communications of particular targets rather than of the population at large.  In all, there are six major distinct phone tracking and tapping methods used by investigators in the US: ""call detail records requests"", ""pen register/trap and trace"", ""content wiretaps"", ""E911 pings"", ""tower dumps"", and ""Stingray/IMSI Catchers"". Each reveals somewhat different information at different times, and each has its own legal implications. An agency might use any or all of them over the course of a given investigation. Let's take them one by one.    The first of these techniques involves targeted, retrospective records requests.   1. Call Detail Records (CDR) Requests      ""Call detail records"" (""CDRs"") are the official billing records maintained by the telephone company about call activity -- the incoming and outgoing calls made and received by each subscriber. This includes the date and time of the call, the telephone number dialed (or from which the subscriber was called), whether the call was completed, and the length of the call. For cellular phones, CDRs will typically also identify the local cellular ""base stations"" that serviced the call. Because a phone generally registers itself with the nearest base station, knowing the base station that served a call tells you the location of the subscriber at the time the call occurred (but see below). Note that CDRs do not record the voice content of phone calls, although SMS messaging text is typically stored. (Voicemail content is also generally stored by the phone company, but that's different from a CDR for wiretapping purposes).      Every call made or received generates a CDR record. Data services, such as SMS messaging and Internet access, also generate CDRs. (Apps on modern smartphones will often access the Internet frequently without explicit action by the user, so your phone may be generating CDRs even when you're not actually using it.) All phone companies routinely maintain CDRs internally for all their subscribers, not just those under investigation by the police. These records are typically stored for anywhere from a few years to forever, depending on the policy of the particular company.      Although CDRs are sometimes called ""billing records"", they are still generated for subscribers who have flat rate services or who otherwise might not receive itemized bills that list every call made.      Law enforcement agencies can generally request CDRs about a particular subscriber with what amounts to a simple subpoena that attests that the request is relevant to an investigation. These requests are supposed to be targeted; they ask for the CDRs associated with a given phone number during a given time period. Because CDRs are routinely generated for everyone, this allows an investigator to retrospectively examine the phone activity of just about anyone, even activity from before they came to the attention of the authorities.      Whether the CDRs delivered to law enforcement in response to a subpoena will (or should) include the cell base station information (which effectively reveals the target's location) is a matter of some controversy. A number of courts are requiring warrants (a much higher legal standard) for requests that include location information (see for example this opinion [pdf]). How revealing is base station location information? It depends, but can be quite precise; see my testimony earlier this year in the House Judiciary Committee [pdf] for a discussion.      SMS text is usually not delivered to law enforcement in response to a CDR request; that generally requires a content warrant.   Next are a variety of targeted real time, prospective intercept techniques.   2. Pen Register / Trap and Trace      CDRs are retrospective. They reveal past activity, but the records may require some time to deliver after being requested. However, the same data contained in CDRs can also be delivered to law enforcement in real time, whenever calls are made or received by the target. For historical reasons, information delivered about the numbers dialed in outgoing calls is called a ""pen register"" (also sometimes called a ""dialed number recorder"" or ""DNR""), while information about incoming calls is called a ""trap and trace"". In practice, pen registers and trap and traces for a target are almost always requested and delivered together, and the term ""pen register"" is sometimes used to refer to both kinds of real time data.      In the days of analog wired telephones, pen registers involved physically tapping into the target's phone wires and installing a device that detected rotary dialed digit pulses on the line, electro-mechanically registering them as ink marks on paper (hence the term). Today, telephone company switches (for both wired and cellular phones) are required to include a so-called ""lawful access"" interface that can be configured to electronically deliver call information about targeted subscribers to law enforcement agencies in real time. This feature is sometimes called the ""CALEA interface"" (for the law that mandated it) or the ""J-STD-25 interface"" (for the technical standard that it follows). The CALEA interface is supposed to be controlled by the telephone company, which configures it to deliver activity associated with the phone numbers specified in law enforcement requests. While it may take some time for the phone company to set up a new intercept for a particular phone number, once this is done all call information is delivered to the law enforcement agency as soon as it occurs.      The legal standard for getting a pen register / trap and trace is similar to that for a CDR request: essentially an attestation to a court that the information is relevant to an investigation.      As with CDRs, pen registers (and trap and traces) for cellular phones can include cell site information giving the target's location at the time of each call event. And as with CDRs, this is a matter of some controversy, with some courts requiring a warrant for requests that include location data. (Again, see the links in the previous section for more discussion.)    3. Content Wiretaps      When we think of ""wiretaps"", we generally think of an investigator listening in to the actual audio of calls. In fact, compared with CDR requests and pen registers, audio content wiretaps by law enforcement are relatively rare. There are two reasons for this. First, they are quite labor intensive. Modern computer techniques make call records -- ""metadata"" -- relatively easy to automatically process and analyze in the aggregate, allowing a human investigator to quickly discern patterns of activity without having to examine each record by hand. Call content, on the other hand, has to be interpreted by a human. Every minute the subject talks is a minute an investigator must spend listening, who then must try to figure out what, exactly, was meant by what was said.      Also, content wiretaps are governed by much more stringent legal standards than CDR requests and pen registers. Federal wiretap law requires a special warrant based on a showing of probable cause that the wiretap will yield evidence of a crime, and that other investigative methods would be ineffective.      Call audio of the target of a content tap is delivered to law enforcement in real time using the same ""lawful access"" phone switch features used to deliver pen register and trap and trace data. The mechanism is the same as a pen register; the only difference is how the intercept is configured by the phone company.      In addition to call audio, content wiretaps will generally include the pen register and trap and trace data that identifies the numbers dialed and the numbers of incoming callers. For cell phones, it will also generally include the texts of SMS messages and the base station information that effectively reveals the phone's location during calls.    4. E911 Pings      The cellular base station IDs contained in CDRs and pen register records for cellular phones is only one way for law enforcement to obtain the location of a target. (As noted above, the legal standard for when law enforcement can get this is currently somewhat unsettled, but, in any case, it is available to them with a warrant). But this approach has a number of limitations. In more sparsely populated areas, where base stations are located far from one another, the nearest base station ID may only locate the target to within a relatively large area. And CDRs and pen register records are only generated when a call event occurs (e.g., when a target makes or receives a call).      But cellular networks also keep track of the location of any subscriber phones that are powered on and in range of the network, even those not in the process of making or receiving calls. Cellular phones work by periodically scanning for and ""registering"" with the nearest base station (generally the one with the strongest radio signal). When a phone moves out of range of one base station, it will search for and register with a base station in its new area. The latest base station with which a phone has registered is maintained in a central telephone company database that is used to route incoming calls to the correct base station. This process is automatic and transparent to the user; it happens as soon as the phone is turned on. That is, the current location of every powered on phone in the network is always known to the cellular carrier.      Law enforcement can request the location of particular subscriber phones from the phone company. Most cellular companies have the ability to deliver this information from its databases to law enforcement in near real time, once the agency has certified that it has legal authorization to request it. (The legal standard for obtaining this data is, as before, currently a matter of some controversy). Law enforcement ""pings"" for a target's location can typically be performed on demand or at periodic intervals.      Depending on the technical capabilities of the carrier and the subscriber's handset, the location information delivered in response to a law enforcement ping might consist simply of the currently registered base station or it might be more precise than that. Current generation handsets are required to have the capability to calculate their position to within several meters. This location information is designed for emergency use and is automatically transmitted when the subscriber calls 911. In some cases, the carrier can trigger the ""E911"" precise location feature remotely (or use signal triangulation techniques to calculate precise location itself) at law enforcement request.   Finally, and perhaps less widely known until recently, are two un-targeted, location-specific cell phone tracking techniques that are increasingly being used by US federal and local law enforcement. These methods were the subject of the recent Washington Post and USA Today articles mentioned above.   5. Tower Dumps      Above, we discussed how law enforcement can request the call records associated with a particular subscriber over a given time period. But what if they don't know what telephone number to ask for, e.g., they want to identify potential suspects who were in a certain area at a particular time? In such cases, they can request a ""tower dump"" of the cellular base station (or stations) that serve the target area for the time period of interest.      A tower dump lists the CDRs (and, in some cases, new handset registrations) generated for a particular base station over some time period. That is, it is effectively a list of all the telephones and call activity in an area at a particular time. This allows an investigator to request information about everyone who was in a given area without having to specify who is being asked about in the request.      The ability to obtain tower dumps was relatively little known until recently, but they are now a standard wiretapping service offered to law enforcement by almost every major cellular carrier. However, the legal requirements for obtaining tower dumps remain somewhat unclear. They are, by their nature, untargeted, delivering information about activities of everyone in an area, most of whom are presumably not, and will never be, suspects. Tower dumps do not appear to have been anticipated by the pen register statute, which assumes more particular targeting. As awareness and use of tower dumps grows, this will likely become an issue addressed by the courts.    6. Stingrays / IMSI Catchers      All of the wiretapping and tracking technologies discussed to this point are implemented by the telephone company in response to a (presumably legal) law enforcement request. That is, law enforcement cannot conduct them without the active cooperation of the phone company (which, of course, can be compelled by a court). However, it is also possible for law enforcement to use special devices that track cellular phones directly,      Called, variously, ""IMSI catchers"" or ""Stingrays"" (the trade name of the dominant product marketed to law enforcement), these devices identify the active cellular telephones at a particular location. A Stingray is essentially a portable ""fake"" cellular base station that can be carried (or driven) to the location of interest. Once enabled, the Stingray presents a strong signal to the cellular phones within its range, causing nearby phones to attempt to register with the Stingray as if it were a real base station operated by the cellular carrier. But instead of providing service, the device simply records the identity of each cellular phone that registered with it and then shuts itself down.      Stingrays come in a variety of configurations, including semi-portable models equipped with directional antennas that can be used to identify the phones in particular streets, houses or rooms. Use of the devices can cause some disruption to cellular service in an area, so, unlike carrier-based tracking techniques, they are potentially alerting to the target.      Stingrays are typically used early in an investigation to identify suspects and their telephone numbers. Once identified by the Stingray, conventional CDR requests, pen registers, or content taps can be used for further tracking.      As with tower dumps, the legal requirements for using Stingrays remains somewhat unclear; at least one recent court case has challenged evidence obtained by them without a warrant.   Those are the major law enforcement techniques. They aren't the only tracking and interception methods that an agency could theoretically use, but these are the six that relate to tracking phones based on their interaction with a cellular network. That said, there are other phone-related surveillance tools at law enforcement's disposal as well. There's some evidence, for example, that the FBI has the ability to install surveillance malware on the devices of high-value targets, and this could possibly include cellphones. Location information may also be stored by third parties (such as companies that provide mapping apps), whose records law enforcement can get. And we're excluding things like forensic analysis of seized handsets to obtain stored contact lists, which, while commonly done, isn't really ""tracking"" in the sense of this post.  ",""

It would prove to be merely the first public news of a scandal that would roil Greece for months.  The next day, the prime minister of Greece was told that his cellphone was being bugged, as were those of the mayor of Athens and at least 100 other high-ranking dignitaries, including an employee of the U.S. embassy [see sidebar âCEOs, MPs, & a PM.â]  The victims were customers of Athens-based Vodafone-Panafon, generally known as Vodafone Greece, the country's largest cellular service provider; Tsalikidis was in charge of network planning at the company. A connection seemed obvious. Given the list of people and their positions at the time of the tapping, we can only imagine the sensitive political and diplomatic discussions, high-stakes business deals, or even marital indiscretions that may have been routinely overheard and, quite possibly, recorded.

Malhotra/Getty Images Babu/Reuters; Sondeep Shankar/ Bloomberg News/Landov; B Mathur/Reuters    Even before Tsalikidis's death, investigators had found rogue software installed on the Vodafone Greece phone network by parties unknown. Some extraordinarily knowledgeable people either penetrated the network from outside or subverted it from within, aided by an agent or mole. In either case, the software at the heart of the phone system, investigators later discovered, was reprogrammed with a finesse and sophistication rarely seen before or since.  A study of the Athens affair, surely the most bizarre and embarrassing scandal ever to engulf a major cellphone service provider, sheds considerable light on the measures networks can and should take to reduce their vulnerability to hackers and moles.  It's also a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most elusive of cybercrimes. Major network penetrations of any kind are exceedingly uncommon. They are hard to pull off, and equally hard to investigate.  Even among major criminal infiltrations, the Athens affair stands out because it may have involved state secrets, and it targeted individualsâa combination that, if it had ever occurred before, was not disclosed publicly. The most notorious penetration to compromise state secrets was that of the âCuckoo's Egg,â a name bestowed by the wily network administrator who successfully pursued a German programmer in 1986. The programmer had been selling secrets about the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (âStar Warsâ) to the Soviet KGB.  But unlike the Cuckoo's Egg, the Athens affair targeted the conversations of specific, highly placed government and military officials. Given the ease with which the conversations could have been recorded, it is generally believed that they were. But no one has found any recordings, and we don't know how many of the calls were recorded, or even listened to, by the perpetrators. Though the scope of the activity is to a large extent unknown, it's fair to say that no other computer crime on record has had the same potential for capturing information about affairs of state.  While this is the first major infiltration to involve cellphones, the scheme did not depend on the wireless nature of the network. Basically, the hackers broke into a telephone network and subverted its built-in wiretapping features for their own purposes. That could have been done with any phone account, not just cellular ones. Nevertheless, there are some elements of the Vodafone Greece system that were unique and crucial to the way the crime was pulled off.  We still don't know who committed this crime. A big reason is that the UK-based Vodafone Group, one of the largest cellular providers in the world, bobbled its handling of some key log files. It also reflexively removed the rogue software, instead of letting it continue to run, tipping off the perpetrators that their intrusion had been detected and giving them a chance to run for cover. The company was fined 76 million this past December.  To piece together this story, we have pored through hundreds of pages of depositions, taken by the Greek parliamentary committee investigating the affair, obtained through a freedom of information request filed with the Greek Parliament. We also read through hundreds of pages of documentation and other records, supplemented by publicly available information and interviews with independent experts and sources associated with the case. What emerges are the technical details, if not the motivation, of a devilishly clever and complicated computer infiltration.  *The cellphone bugging* began sometime during the fevered run-up to the August 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. It remained undetected until 24 January 2005, when one of Vodafone's telephone switches generated a sequence of error messages indicating that text messages originating from another cellphone operator had gone undelivered. The switch is a computer-controlled component of a phone network that connects two telephone lines to complete a telephone call. To diagnose the failures, which seemed highly unusual but reasonably innocuous at the time, Vodafone contacted the maker of the switches, the Swedish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Ericsson.  We now know that the illegally implanted software, which was eventually found in a total of four of Vodafone's Greek switches, created parallel streams of digitized voice for the tapped phone calls. One stream was the ordinary one, between the two calling parties. The other stream, an exact copy, was directed to other cellphones, allowing the tappers to listen in on the conversations on the cellphones, and probably also to record them. The software also routed location and other information about those phone calls to these shadow handsets via automated text messages.  Five weeks after the first messaging failures, on 4 March 2005, Ericsson alerted Vodafone that unauthorized software had been installed in two of Vodafone's central offices. Three days later, Vodafone technicians isolated the rogue code. The next day, 8 March, the CEO of Vodafone Greece, Giorgos Koronias, ordered technicians to remove the software.  Then events took a deadly turn. On 9 March, Tsalikidis, who was to be married in three months, was found hanged in his apartment. No one knows whether his apparent suicide was related to the case, but many observers have speculated that it was.  The day after Tsalikidis's body was discovered, CEO Koronias met with the director of the Greek prime minister's political office. Yiannis Angelou, and the minister of public order, Giorgos Voulgarakis. Koronias told them that rogue software used the lawful wiretapping mechanisms of Vodafone's digital switches to tap about 100 phones and handed over a list of bugged numbers. Besides the prime minister and his wife, phones belonging to the ministers of national defense, foreign affairs, and justice, the mayor of Athens, and the Greek European Union commissioner were all compromised. Others belonged to members of civil rights organizations, peace activists, and antiglobalization groups; senior staff at the ministries of National Defense, Public Order, Merchant Marine, and Foreign Affairs; the New Democracy ruling party; the Hellenic Navy general staff; and a Greek-American employee at the United States Embassy in Athens.  Within weeks of the initial discovery of the tapping scheme, Greek government and independent authorities launched five different investigations aimed at answering three main questions: Who was responsible for the bugging? Was Tsalikidis's death related to the scandal? And how did the perpetrators pull off this audacious scheme?  *To understand how* someone could secretly listen to the conversations of Greece's most senior officials, we have to look at the infrastructure that makes it possible.  First, consider how a phone call, yours or a prime minister's, gets completed. Long before you dial a number on your handset, your cellphone has been communicating with nearby cellular base stations. One of those stations, usually the nearest, has agreed to be the intermediary between your phone and the network as a whole. Your telephone handset converts your words into a stream of digital data that is sent to a transceiver at the base station.  cell phone system illustration  </image/636009> Illustration: Bryan Christie Design  The base station's activities are governed by a base station controller, a special-purpose computer within the station that allocates radio channels and helps coordinate handovers between the transceivers under its control.  This controller in turn communicates with a mobile switching center that takes phone calls and connects them to call recipients within the same switching center, other switching centers within the company, or special exchanges that act as gateways to foreign networks, routing calls to other telephone networks (mobile or landline). The mobile switching centers are particularly important to the Athens affair because they hosted the rogue phone-tapping software, and it is there that the eavesdropping originated. They were the logical choice, because they are at the heart of the network; the intruders needed to take over only a few of them in order to carry out their attack.  Both the base station controllers and the switching centers are built around a large computer, known as a switch, capable of creating a dedicated communications path between a phone within its network and, in principle, any other phone in the world. Switches are holdovers from the 1970s, an era when powerful computers filled rooms and were built around proprietary hardware and software. Though these computers are smaller nowadays, the system's basic architecture remains largely unchanged.  Like most phone companies, Vodafone Greece uses the same kind of computer for both its mobile switching centers and its base station controllersâEricsson's AXE line of switches. A central processor coordinates the switch's operations and directs the switch to set up a speech or data path from one phone to another and then routes a call through it. Logs of network activity and billing records are stored on disk by a separate unit, called a management processor.  The key to understanding the hack at the heart of the Athens affair is knowing how the Ericsson AXE allows lawful interceptsâwhat are popularly called âwiretaps.â Though the details differ from country to country, in Greece, as in most places, the process starts when a law enforcement official goes to a court and obtains a warrant, which is then presented to the phone company whose customer is to be tapped.  Nowadays, all wiretaps are carried out at the central office. In AXE exchanges a remote-control equipment subsystem, or RES, carries out the phone tap by monitoring the speech and data streams of switched calls. It is a software subsystem typically used for setting up wiretaps, which only law officers are supposed to have access to. When the wiretapped phone makes a call, the RES copies the conversation into a second data stream and diverts that copy to a phone line used by law enforcement officials.  Ericsson optionally provides an interception management system (IMS), through which lawful call intercepts are set up and managed. When a court order is presented to the phone company, its operators initiate an intercept by filling out a dialog box in the IMS software. The optional IMS in the operator interface and the RES in the exchange each contain a list of wiretaps: wiretap requests in the case of the IMS, actual taps in the RES. Only IMS-initiated wiretaps should be active in the RES, so a wiretap in the RES without a request for a tap in the IMS is a pretty good indicator that an unauthorized tap has occurred. An audit procedure can be used to find any discrepancies between them.  It turns out Vodafone had not purchased the lawful intercept option at the time of the illegal wiretaps, and the IMS phone-tapping management software was not installed on Vodafone's systems. But in early 2003, Vodafone technicians upgraded the Greek switches to release R9.1 of the AXE software suite. That upgrade included the RES software, according to a letter from Ericsson that accompanied the upgrade. So after the upgrade, the Vodafone system contained the software code necessary to intercept calls using the RES, even though it lacked the high-level user interface in the IMS normally used to facilitate such intercepts.  That odd circumstance would turn out to play a role in letting the Athens hackers illegally listen in on calls and yet escape detection for months and months.  *It took guile* and some serious programming chops to manipulate the lawful call-intercept functions in Vodafone's mobile switching centers. The intruders' task was particularly complicated because they needed to install and operate the wiretapping software on the exchanges without being detected by Vodafone or Ericsson system administrators. From time to time the intruders needed access to the rogue software to update the lists of monitored numbers and shadow phones. These activities had to be kept off all logs, while the software itself had to be invisible to the system administrators conducting routine maintenance activities. The intruders achieved all these objectives.  They took advantage of the fact that the AXE allows new software to be installed without rebooting the system, an important feature when any interruption would disconnect phone calls, lose text messages, and render emergency services unreachable. To let an AXE exchange run continuously for decades, as many of them do, Ericsson's software uses several techniques for handling failures and upgrading an exchange's software without suspending its operation. These techniques allow the direct patching of code loaded in the central processor, in effect altering the operating system on the fly.  Modern GSM systems, such as Vodafone's, secure the wireless links with a sophisticated encryption mechanism. A call to another cellphone will be re-encrypted between the remote cellphone and its closest base station, but it is not protected while it transits the provider's core network. For this reasonâand for the ease of monitoring calls from the comfort of their lairâthe perpetrators of the Vodafone wiretaps attacked the core switches of the Vodafone network. Encrypting communications from the start of the chain to its endâas banks, for example, doâmakes it very difficult to implement legal wiretaps.  To simplify software maintenance, the AXE has detailed rules for directly patching software running on its central processor. The AXE's existing code is structured around independent blocks, or program modules, which are stored in the central processor's memory. The release being used in 2004 consisted of about 1760 blocks. Each contains a small âcorrection area,â used whenever software is updated with a patch.  Let's say you're patching in code to force the computer to do a new function, Z, in situations where it has been doing a different function, Y. So, for example, where the original software had an instruction, âIf X, then do Yâ the patched software says, in effect, âIf X, then go to the correction area location L.â The software goes to location L and executes the instructions it finds there, that is, Z. In other words, a software patch works by replacing an instruction at the area of the code to be fixed with an instruction that diverts the program to a memory location in the correction area containing the new version of the code.  The challenge faced by the intruders was to use the RES's capabilities to duplicate and divert the bits of a call stream without using the dialog-box interface to the IMS, which would create auditable logs of their activities. The intruders pulled this off by installing a series of patches to 29 separate blocks of code, according to Ericsson officials who testified before the Greek parliamentary committee that investigated the wiretaps. This rogue software modified the central processor's software to directly initiate a wiretap, using the RES's capabilities. Best of all, for them, the taps were not visible to the operators, because the IMS and its user interface weren't used.  The full version of the software would have recorded the phone numbers being tapped in an official registry within the exchange. And, as we noted, an audit could then find a discrepancy between the numbers monitored by the exchange and the warrants active in the IMS. But the rogue software bypassed the IMS. Instead, it cleverly stored the bugged numbers in two data areas that were part of the rogue software's own memory space, which was within the switch's memory but isolated and not made known to the rest of the switch.  That by itself put the rogue software a long way toward escaping detection. But the perpetrators hid their own tracks in a number of other ways as well. There were a variety of circumstances by which Vodafone technicians could have discovered the alterations to the AXE's software blocks. For example, they could have taken a listing of all the blocks, which would show all the active processes running within the AXEâsimilar to the task manager output in Microsoft Windows or the process status (ps) output in Unix. They then would have seen that some processes were active, though they shouldn't have been. But the rogue software apparently modified the commands that list the active blocks in a way that omitted certain blocksâthe ones that related to interceptsâfrom any such listing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------      *THE ROGUE SOFTWARE STORED BUGGED PHONE NUMBERS      IN ITS OWN MEMORY SPACE *  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  In addition, the rogue software might have been discovered during a software upgrade or even when Vodafone technicians installed a minor patch. It is standard practice in the telecommunications industry for technicians to verify the existing block contents before performing an upgrade or patch. We don't know why the rogue software was not detected in this way, but we suspect that the software also modified the operation of the command used to print the checksumsâcodes that create a kind of signature against which the integrity of the existing blocks can be validated. One way or another, the blocks appeared unaltered to the operators.  Finally, the software included a back door to allow the perpetrators to control it in the future. This, too, was cleverly constructed to avoid detection. A report by the Hellenic Authority for the Information and Communication Security and Privacy (the Greek abbreviation is ADAE) indicates that the rogue software modified the exchange's command parserâa routine that accepts commands from a person with system administrator statusâso that innocuous commands followed by six spaces would deactivate the exchange's transaction log and the alarm associated with its deactivation, and allow the execution of commands associated with the lawful interception subsystem. In effect, it was a signal to allow operations associated with the wiretaps but leave no trace of them. It also added a new user name and password to the system, which could be used to obtain access to the exchange.  Software that not only alters operating system code but also hides its tracks is called a ârootkit.â The term is known to the publicâif at allâbecause of one that the record label Sony BMG Music Entertainment included on some music CDs released in 2005. The Sony rootkit restricted copying of CDs; it burrowed into the Windows operating system on PCs and then hid its existence from the owner. (Sony stopped using rootkits because of a general public outcry.) Security experts have also discovered other rootkits for general-purpose operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and Solaris, but to our knowledge this is the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch.  *With all of this sophisticated* subterfuge, how then was the rogue software finally discovered? On 24 January 2005, the perpetrators updated their planted software. That upgrade interfered with the forwarding of text messages, which went undelivered. These undelivered text messages, in turn, triggered an automated failure report.  At this point, the hackers' abilities to keep their modifications to the switch's AXE software suite secret met their limits, as it's almost impossible to hide secrets in somebody else's system.  The AXE, like most large software systems, logs all manner of network activity. System administrators can review the log files, and any events they can't account for as ordinary usage can be investigated.  It's impossible to overstate the importance of logging. For example, in the 1986 Cuckoo's Egg intrusion, the wily network administrator, Clifford Stoll, was asked to investigate a 75 U.S. cents accounting error. Stoll spent 10 months looking for the hacker, who had penetrated deep into the networks of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a U.S. nuclear weapons lab in California. Much of that time he spent poring over thousands of log report pages.  The AXE, like most sophisticated systems nowadays, can help operators find the nuggets of useful information within the voluminous logs it generates. It is programmed to report anomalous activity on its own, in the form of error or failure reports. In addition, at regular intervals the switching center generates a snapshot of itselfâa copy, or dump, of all its programs and data.  Dumps are most commonly consulted for recovery and diagnostic purposes, but they can be used in security investigations. So when Ericsson's investigators were called in because of the undelivered text messages, the first thing they did was look closely at the periodic dumps. They found two areas containing all the phone numbers being monitored and retrieved a list of them.  The investigators examined the dumps more thoroughly and found the rogue programs. What they found though, was in the form of executable codeâin other words, code in the binary language that microprocessors directly execute. Executable code is what results when a software compiler turns source codeâin the case of the AXE, programs written in the PLEX languageâinto the binary machine code that a computer processor executes. So the investigators painstakingly reconstructed an approximation of the original PLEX source files that the intruders developed. It turned out to be the equivalent of about 6500 lines of code, a surprisingly substantial piece of software.  The investigators ran the modules in simulated environments to better understand their behavior. The result of all this investigative effort was the discovery of the data areas holding the tapped numbers and the time stamps of recent intercepts.  With this information on hand, the investigators could go back and look at earlier dumps to establish the time interval during which the wiretaps were in effect and to get the full list of intercepted numbers and call data for the tapped conversationsâwho called whom, when, and for how long. (The actual conversations were not stored in the logs.)  While the hack was complex, the taps themselves were straightforward. When the prime minister, for example, initiated or received a call on his cellphone, the exchange would establish the same kind of connection used in a lawful wiretapâa connection to a shadow number allowing it to listen in on the conversation.  Creating the rogue software so that it would remain undetected required a lot of expertise in writing AXE code, an esoteric competency that isn't readily available in most places. But as it happens, for the past 15 years, a considerable part of Ericsson's software development for the AXE has been done under contract by a Greek company based in Athens, Intracom Telecom, part of Intracom Holdings. The necessary know-how was available locally and was spread over a large number of present and past Intracom developers. So could this have been an inside job?  The early stages of the infiltration would have been much easier to pull off with the assistance of someone inside Vodafone, but there is no conclusive evidence to support that scenario. The infiltration could have been carried out remotely and, indeed, according to a state report, in the case of the failed text messages where the exact time of the event is known, the last person to access the exchange had been issued a visitor's badge.  Similarly, we may never know whether Tsalikidis had anything to do with the wiretaps. Many observers have found the timing of his death highly suggestive, but to this day no connection has been uncovered. Nor can observers do more than speculate as to the motives of the infiltrators. [See the sidebar, âAn Inside Job? <#>â for a summary of the leading speculation; we can neither endorse nor refute the theories presented.]  Just as we cannot now know for certain who was behind the Athens affair or what their motives were, we can only speculate about various approaches that the intruders may have followed to carry out their attack. That's because key material has been lost or was never collected. For instance, in July 2005, while the investigation was taking place, Vodafone upgraded two of the three servers used for accessing the exchange management system. This upgrade wiped out the access logs and, contrary to company policy, no backups were retained. Some time later a six-month retention period for visitor sign-in books lapsed, and Vodafone destroyed the books corresponding to the period where the rogue software was modified, triggering the text-message errors.  Traces of the rogue software installation might have been recorded on the exchange's transaction logs. However, due to a paucity of storage space in the exchange's management systems, the logs were retained for only five days, because Vodafone considers billing data, which competes for the same space, a lot more important. Most crucially, Vodafone's deactivation of the rogue software on 7 March 2005 almost certainly alerted the conspirators, giving them a chance to switch off the shadow phones. As a result investigators missed the opportunity of triangulating the location of the shadow phones and catching the perpetrators in the act.  *So what can this affair* teach us about how to protect phone networks?  Once the infiltration was discovered, Vodafone had to balance the need for the continued operation of the network with the discovery and prosecution of the guilty parties. Unfortunately, the responses of Vodafone and that of Greek law enforcement were both inadequate. Through Vodafone's actions, critical data were lost or destroyed, while the perpetrators not only received a warning that their scheme had been discovered but also had sufficient time to disappear.  In the telecommunications industry, prevailing best practices require that the operator's policies include procedures for responding to an infiltration, such as a virus attack: retain all data, isolate the part of the system that's been broken into as much as possible, coordinate activities with law enforcement.  Greek federal telecom regulations also specify that operators have security policies that detail the measures they will take to ensure the confidentiality of customer communications and the privacy of network users. However, Vodafone's response indicates that such policies, if they existed, were ignored. If not for press conferences and public investigations, law enforcement could have watched the behavior of the shadow cellphones surreptitiously. Physical logbooks of visitors were lost and data logs were destroyed. In addition, neither law enforcement authorities nor the ADAE, the independent security and privacy authority, was contacted directly. Instead, Vodafone Greece communicated through a political channelâthe prime minister's office. It should be noted the ADAE was a fairly new organization at the time, formed in 2003.  The response of Greek law enforcement officials also left a lot to be desired. Police could have secured evidence by impounding all of Vodafone's telecommunications and computer equipment involved in the incident. Instead it appears that concerns about disruption to the operation of the mobile telephone network led the authorities to take a more light-handed approachâessentially interviewing employees and collecting information provided by Vodafoneâthat ultimately led to the loss of forensic evidence. They eventually started leveling accusations at both the operator (Vodafone) and the vendor (Ericsson), turning the victims into defendants and losing their good will, which further hampered their investigation.  Of course, in countries where such high-tech crimes are rare, it is unreasonable to expect to find a crack team of investigators. Could a rapid deployment force be set up to handle such high-profile and highly technical incidents? We'd like to see the international police organization Interpol create a cyberforensics response team that countries could call on to handle such incidents.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------      *PHYSICAL LOGBOOKS OF VISITORS WERE LOST AND      DATA LOGS WERE DESTROYED *  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Telephone exchanges have evolved over the decades into software-based systems, and therefore the task of analyzing them for vulnerabilities has become very difficult. Even as new software features, such as conferencing, number portability, and caller identification, have been loaded onto the exchanges, the old software remains in place. Complex interactions between subsystems and baroque coding styles (some of them remnants of programs written 20 or 30 years ago) confound developers and auditors alike.  Yet an effective defense against viruses, worms, and rootkits depends crucially on in-depth analysis that can penetrate source code in all its baroque heterogeneity. For example, a statistical analysis of the call logs might have revealed a correlation between the calls to the shadow numbers and calls to the monitored numbers. Telephone companies already carry out extensive analysis on these sorts of data to spot customer trends. But from the security perspective, this analysis is done for the wrong reasons and by the wrong peopleâmarketing as opposed to security. By training security personnel to use these tools and allowing them access to these data, customer trend analysis can become an effective countermeasure against rogue software.  Additional clues could be uncovered by merging call records generated by the exchange with billing and accounting information. Doing so, though, involves consolidating distinct data sets currently owned by different entities within the telecom organization.  Another defense is regular auditing of the type that allowed Ericsson to discover the rogue software by scrutinizing the off-line dumps. However, in this case, as well as in the data analysis case, we have to be sure that any rogue software cannot modify the information stored in the logs or the dumps, such as by using a separate monitoring computer running its own software.  Digital systems generate enormous volumes of information. Ericsson and Vodafone Greece had at their fingertips all the information they needed to discover the penetration of Vodafone's network long before an undelivered text message sent them looking. As in other industries, the challenge now is to come up with ways to use this information. If one company's technicians and one country's police force cannot meet this challenge, a response team that can needs to be created.  It is particularly important not to turn the investigation into a witch hunt. Especially in cases where the perpetrators are unlikely to be identified, it is often politically expedient to use the telecom operator as a convenient scapegoat. This only encourages operators and their employees to brush incidents under the carpet, and turns them into adversaries of law enforcement. Rather than looking for someone to blame (and punish), it is far better to determine exactly what went wrong and how it can be fixed, not only for that particular operator, but for the industry as a whole.  Merely sayingâor even legislatingâthat system vendors and network operators should not allow something like this to occur is pointless, because there is little that can be done to these companies after the fact. Instead, proactive measures should be taken to ensure that such systems are developed and operated safely. Perhaps we can borrow a few pages from aviation safety, where both aircraft manufacturers and airline companies are closely monitored by national and international agencies to ensure the safety of airline passengers.   Sidebar article:           CEOs, MPs & a PM  The illegally wiretapped cellphones in the Athens affair included those of the prime minister, his defense and foreign affairs ministers, top military and law enforcement officials, the Greek EU commissioner, activists, and journalists.  Hellas Photo: Kostas Tsironis/AP PhotoOn 6 April 2006, *Bill Zikou,* CEO of Ericsson Hellas, was summoned to give evidence before a parliamentary committee looking into the scandal. His company provided the telecommunications switching equipment that rogue programmers broke into.  koronias Photo: Kostas Tsironis/AP Photo Vodafone Greece CEO Giorgos Koronias ordered the removal of the surveillance program, because, as he explained in a February 2006 newspaper interview, âthe company had to react immediately.â Removing the program is thought to have tipped off the perpetrators and helped them evade capture.  Karamanlis Photo: Johanna Leguerre/AFP/Getty ImagesGreek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was only the most notable of the 100 or so individuals illegally wiretapped, which, besides the countryâs political, law enforcement, and military elite, included Karamanlisâs wife.  Tsalikidis Photo: AFP/Getty ImagesCostas Tsalikidis was found hanged, an apparent suicide, just before the Athens affair became public. As a telecommunications engineer in charge of network planning at Vodafone, he was ideally placed to be either an inside accomplice or discoverer of the digital break-in.

Right here, the buyer will enter a public key. The vendor will be able to enter multiple public keys in advance, otherwise they'll be asked to enter one when they choose 'finalize early' or 'escrow'. Once the vendor selects this and has provided a public key, the admins public key will automatically be generated (probably from an MPK, ideally..), and the multisig address, and the details sent to everyone: the address, the amount that needs to be sent, the redeemScript (so they can verify it encodes all the correct details). Regardless of whether the payment is 'finalize early' or 'escrow', then the site will poll the blockchain for payments to that address. Once the full amount is paid, then the order is marked as paid, and all users messaged a link to a page that shows the generated transaction, paying the vendor the full amount, minus the sites fee (a raw transaction spending all the transactions sent to the multisg address, and sending to the vendor in one output, and to the sites fees address in another). Everyone will be shown the transaction paying the vendor. If the buyer raises a dispute, then the users will start to discuss the order, and the admin will generate a new transaction paying the appropriate amount to both parties. But if it's all successful, then one of the users will sign the transaction, and paste the partially signed transaction on the site. Then the other user will sign the transaction, broadcast it, where it will be identified by bitwasp when it makes it into the blockchain. So, to break it down, the vendor and buyer both have to supply public keys (either in advance or when their action is needed, like entering an address, or selecting escrow/FE). They need to add the multisig address to their client if using bitcoinQt using one command, and then sign using another. They can verify the redeemScript or transaction hex so that the details are correct using their client, or else using coinb.in. Entering keys manually is awkward, and it would be great if we could accept electrum MPK's on registration. All the public keys are generated automatically, very cool.. But, then this would mean I would have to upgrade to BIP32 afterwards, because electrum is upgrading to this wallet structure in version 2.0. So, for now, I suggest we only allow the admin to enter MPK's, and have the users enter public keys manually or in advance. They can generate them in their browser, using coinb.in/multisig (I'll be suggesting people download an offline copy of this site, because it means once funds are sent to the multisig address, the two users can add the signature to transactions in the browser, without having to use their client. It's really simple.), or brainwallet.org (and then using them in their client, or coinb.in anyway) Anyway, having users supplying them in the browser is probably the best thing until BIP32 is supported in most clients. Bitcoin-Qt and electrum are definitely going to use BIP32, so excellent. But, that's another milestone, long after multisig goes in. Here's where I need feedback: 1) I'm thinking about asking for an electrum mpk to receive fee's on. What do you think about this? 2) The admin's key should also be generated from an electrum mpk. There is no reason the key needs to be stored on the site. Has anyone ever looked at multisignature transactions in electrum, where the wallet only has one key? I think there is a way to display transactions fit for electrum to sign, but documentation of the code is scarce.. 3) Right now, as we've seen, bitcoin-QT and bitcoind are fine for multisignature transactions. But I feel electrum would be way better. If anyone has any information on how electrum works with multisig please send them my way. 4) How do sites that implement true multisignature escrow do it? How does this sound? Does the process sound like something end users would be easily trained to do? I think it becomes pretty straightforward, as you can see using multisig.bitwasp.co, there are only 2-3 actions the users need to do. One less step when we automate key generation. That's the price they pay for absolute security for their bitcoin. No more heists, all transactions occur in the blockchain, and are only considered valid when in the blockchain. It means no more live wallet, so the possibility for the negative balance hack is removed, and the trust in the site becomes minimal. If the site is run by an attacker, they simply can't run off with the money. Even if there is unexpected downtime, or the admin goes AWOL, buyer and vendor have their public keys, so can try negotiate on another channel to at least sort out their funds themselves. Feedback on this is critical to Bitwasp's success, so please, fire away. ---  Any input is appreachiated. Thanks guys.  I will tip very good replies with some Bitcoins. (10$ till 30$)",""

First, some thoughts on the implementation ...   I'm not sure I like showing the raw, unsigned tx, before deciding on where the btc is going to go. This is an information leak. At the very least, the address the vendor uses will have to be burnt, and a sloppy vendor reusing addresses or using the same address to get funds from every tx is going to expose a lot, and this is at very little risk to the person doing the attack. All they would have to do is cancel the order before the vendor fufills it and they would lose a trivial amount to transaction fees.   I think it's better to wait until it's been decided on where the funds go before generating the raw tx to be signed. Also, buyers tend to be awful at signing payments. I think from a buyer view, they don't need to ever see a tx unless they need to get a refund of some sort. Also, a cautious person might always want their tx to be broadcast as some predetermined time (say 0:10 UTC or something), in order to allow to time information leaks. Because of this, I think it's better for the site to sign the tx, and then have the other party do the final signing and broadcast it themselves.   As to your specific questions   I think it'd be better to accept an extended public key BIP032 style, or give the user an option to input in advance to give them an arbitrary number of addresses to be chosen from randomly. Electrum is moving away from their current key implemantion, even the distributed source has code it in for true bip_32 wallets -- altho I'm not sure if it's actually ever used.   I think the admin keys should probably be random. There are two reasons for this. One, is that I think the site should have the private keys available because I think the normal signatures should be site + whoever is getting the btc. Buyer + vendor should be for unusual situations. This means that you'd have to store the extended master private key, which is a huge security problem should that be compromised.   The second is that even if you do only store some version of an extended public key, if that is compromised, you'd readily be able to tract transactions in the blockchain by looking for tx that redeem a p2sh style address with one of the public keys in the reedemscript.    As it stands, Electrum's multi-sig is horribly broken. The only way it's gonna work until the new version if you take TMP's plugin and use that.  My code on it is all in pubilc domain, and so is Vitalik Buterin's code from pybtctools that I've used to do some format conversions. I'm not sure how TMPSchultz feels about his code being used, however. He wrote all the actual widget code that deals with the UI and came up with the concept of using deposit addresses to store the keys.   Additionally, electrum stores its transactions internally in a wierdo format. It's not really going to be useful, as it stands, for tracking things in the blockchain   I'm not sure of the internals, but TMP requires vendors to predetermine large numbers of public keys to be used during the order process, and then also predetermine a number of addresses payments go to (this could be as low as 1 address, however).  Electrum is moving towards real BIP032 support. I don't see the point in implementing right now something that uses their wonky key derivation. The TMP plugin will, if it can't find the key in your deposit list, just ask for the correct private key. I think a solution like that, except with real BIP032 is the best.

Why am I posting this? Because ECC is a petty cunt and is the one currently doxxing people on this subreddit. He has threatened every other Cannabis-only marketplace or idea of one as stealing his 'intellectual property.' He has numerous sock puppet accounts and a fairly elaborate repertoire of personalities he cycles through on them. But most importantly, the doxxing. You went too far with that ECC.  ECC was, and is, the primary player behind the original (and also the NEW alpaca-developed Cannabis Road).  ECC's official story is that he was hiring a fellow by the name of Crypto to do the technical side of Cannabis Road. He was paying Crypto $1,000 per week, flat rate.  After the site was 'hacked,' blame was put on Crypto and talk of taking repayments for users out of Crypto's earnings was everywhere. I personally believe Crypto got tired of being overworked and underpaid and just left these bumblefucks to their own devices. Whether or not he took the 100k, or ECC took it, and split it with him, is all left to darknet history. My personal opinion is that there was indeed a hack from outside the known players, but it is mostly irrelevant anyway.  ECC was scrambling in the aftermath. He did not even have access to the admin panel of Cannabis Road. He attempted to get some RANDOM CUSTOMERS AND FORUM USERS of CR to help him, to no avail. Forum admins and vendors were approached asking for suggestions and ideas.  Most would tell him the game is up without access to the admin panel. However, ECC's ego makes this not a possibility.  After several forum members and random customers politely declined any involvement in a new project, ECC sought out other options, and that brings us to today. Now ECC has commissioned Alpaca to develop the new CR for him, on what terms of payment I do not know.  ECC is completely incapable of running a market, on several levels. One of his more famous quotes is that he wishes we could all just use credit cards instead of bitcoins. He has only the most basic grasp of the opsec necessary for this type of activity, and rarely remembers to even encrypt basic communications.  Putting your bitcoin on a site funded and run by ECC is worse than giving your coins away.  ECC will continue to attempt to ""doxx"" a random person who helped put Panacea together because he feels like that person has ""stolen"" his idea for a cannabis only marketplace. This is a seriously fucked up individual we are talking about here, with potential multiple personality disorder and probably a borderline sociopath.  Do not support ECC and his doxxing or his extremely questionable marketplace. I will try to answer any pertinent questions that do not reveal my identity.""   ",""

Didnt get much time to visit the Hub lately, but very glad you guys are still here and standing in times where fagots like evo admins jump ship and set us back like were in 2013 again.  With solid decentralisation a la openbazaar still not in action, we're happy to see more and more vendors setting up individual shops and taking away the high serverload and the millions of commission from big markets.  For this reason we planned to launch Onionshop 2.0 earlier this year. The idea was to sell one-time licences which include the full source code for an independant darknetshop and a guide on how to set it up. We ended up with completely different projects though, so we decided to rather bury OS for now. I dont want to release the source code neither since we are going to use it elsewhere but here's the installation tutorial on how to set up a hidden server. Since I spent some time writing it, Im sure it comes in handy to one or another who wants to set one up. It was written for the Onionshop 2.0 Setup, so maybe you dont need everything (for example the whole GnuPG part for pgp support).  We dont explain on how to set up a shop in this pdf, its just a guide on how to get a hidden service running in general. With the current situation of markets I assume more people than usual are currently playing around with hidden services and setting them up, so they may catch up one or another advice from this doc. cant emphasize enough that there is obviously a lot that can be done to further improve the set up and that it takes more knowhow than a 20 page pdf to run a server safely.

""But officer my account was hacked"" .... ""Oh really, because you PGP-signed the message""  I've seen vendors signing ads.  I've seen people signing forum posts.  Seriously people, stop PGP signing things.  Signing things is for when it's important to prove that you wrote something and that it hasn't been tampered with.  Most of the time that's not necessary.  So stop doing it when it isn't necessary!  Sending a message to a vendor like ""hey I'd like to buy some heroin"" is something that should be encrypted to the vendor's PGP key and NOT SIGNED by your key.  Signing a message like that can only hurt you, not help you.

The only problem with the timestamp is you could lie.  In order to *prove* the timestamp, you could say ""the hash of bitcoin block number [some recent block] is [the hash]"" so you could prove it was written after the date... but in order to lock it in a window of time (proving both before and after times), you'd need to do something like hash the whole pgp-signed message and embed that in the blockchain or something, and that way you have proof it was written *before* it was embedded, and because the message itself contains a block hash, that's proof that it was *after* a certain date, so you have effectively proven a timeframe.  In fact, I think that's probably what those time-stamp services like ""proof of existence"" do.

Hello. I have noticed a lack of proper tutorials on how to use PGP/GPG. I also noticed that the ones which did exist focused on using a GUI application. As an alternative this tutorial will describe the in's and out's to securely and easily using PGP/GPG to encrypt communications, using a terminal interface, so one can maintain anonymity on tor and make sure only intended parties read the messages created. This is a guide on how to encrypt messages via the Gnu Privacy Guard, and does not detail the inner workings, nor signing.    ===Terminology=== First and foremost, there are two different common forms of asymmetric encryption on the deep web that is mentioned; PGP, and GPG. both are more or less the same thing.    PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy.   GPG refers to the more trusted GnuPG, which stands for GNU Privacy Guard. As stated earlier, the two are considered very similar to one another, differing mainly in development and trust. This guide recommends the use of GnuPG, and will be using it.  A  keypair is the combination of public and private keys that form your ability to securely send messages. Your keypair will consist of your public key; the one you share with everyone else, and your private key; the one you keep to yourself and never distribute.   ASCII Armor is the use of ASCII characters to display the encrypted data instead of using a .gpg file. This is desirable when sending messages using PM systems.    ===Installation=== This guide will be using GnuPG, it can be downloaded from the following link (WARNING: CLEARNET LINK) https://www.gnupg.org/index.html If you are running TAILS, GnuPG should already be installed. Once there, go ahead and download a stable release for the OS of your choosing. The application comes with GUI applications, and you are welcome to install them, but throughout this guide we will be using the terminal/command line instead.  You can test to ensure the installation was successful by opening a terminal/cmdPrompt and typing the following command:  gpg --help  A large amount of text including command arguments should display itself on the console, this indicates the installation was successful.   ===Generating a keypair=== Before we can encrypt a message, we are going to need to generate a keypair.  You only need to do this once. to do this, enter the following command:  gpg --gen-keyThe following text will then be prompted:  gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.26; Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.Please select what kind of key you want:   (1) RSA and RSA (default)   (2) DSA and Elgamal   (3) DSA (sign only)   (4) RSA (sign only)Your selection? 1 The main difference between RSA & DSA and Elgamal is the underlying mathematical principles, for this guide we'll be using RSA. Enter  1 and hit enter. Next prompt:  RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096 Technically you should be safe at 2048, but I would recommend the use of 4096 for the added security. Next prompt:  Please specify how long the key should be valid.         0 = key does not expire      <n>  = key expires in n days      <n>w = key expires in n weeks      <n>m = key expires in n months      <n>y = key expires in n yearsKey is valid for? (0) 1y In the world of privacy, permanent anything is usually looked down upon, so I would recommend setting some length of time. For this tutorial my key will last for 1 year. To do this I enter  1y. Next prompt:  Key expires at 12/12/15Is this correct? (y/N) y I entered  y, as it was the correct amount of time. The next prompt will ask for each of the following one at a time. The only field you actually need to fill out is real name. In that category put whatever you want. The Email address and comment are optional.  GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.Real name: WhatEverNameYouWantEmail address:Comment:You selected this USER-ID:    ""WhatEverNameYouWant""Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O Modification options are given, but I'm satisfied with my entry, so I entered  O to progress further.  You will then be presented with a prompt to enter a passphrase. Pick a good one and move on. You will then be presented with the following message:  We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to performsome other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize thedisks) during the prime generation; this gives the random numbergenerator a better chance to gain enough entropy.We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to performsome other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize thedisks) during the prime generation; this gives the random numbergenerator a better chance to gain enough entropy.gpg: key CA637B79 marked as ultimately trustedpublic and secret key created and signed. Basically hit a bunch of keys on your keyboard, and click around a bit until it finishes generating random information. Once done, you should receive some form of confirmation, and return to the console. At this point you will have successfully generated a keypair that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.   ===Getting your public key=== At this stage you now have your own keypair; the next step is to retrieve your public key so you can distribute it for others to use when messaging you. In this tutorial, we created a user under the ID of  WhatEverNameYouWant. This is the ID which I shall use. To print the key, enter the following command:  gpg --armor --export WhatEverNameYouWantwhere  WhatEverNameYouWant is the ID or Email picked when creating the keypair.

Like generating a keypair,  you only need to do this once. For this tutorial I will be importing the public key provided on Agora's help and info page. You are more than welcome to import the public key displayed earlier. The first step is to copy the public key to a text file.  Once that is done, enter the following command:   gpg --import pubkey.asc  where  pubkey.asc is the file where you saved the public key you want to import. Here's the output you should receive:  gpg: key (Expunged): public key ""Agora One"" importedgpg: Total number processed: 1gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1) And that's it, you can now write messages using the key imported.   ===Encrypting a message=== Once you have imported someone else's public key, you can encrypt a message. For this tutorial, I will use the text  Hello World! and place it into file myMessage.txt . Now that we have a file with a message in it, enter the following command:  gpg --armor --output encMessage.asc --encrypt myMessage.txtwhere  myMessage.txt is the name of the file you are encrypting. Throughout this tutorial, there has been use of other parameters before encrypting the message. Let's take a minute and examine the parameters set forth. Notice that we use  --encrypt and then the file name to specify the file to encrypt, but there are a few other parameters not fully described.  --armor tells the program to use ASCII armor, this makes GnuPG encrypt the data in the file so it can be copied and pasted via text characters.  --output enables the user to specify a name and location of the output file, where  encMessage.asc is the desired name of the output file.   So once that command is input, the user will be prompted to enter a recipient. As seen earlier, the user ID for Agora was  Agora One. So that is what I entered. Alternatively, the user's email can also be entered. After that, I simply hit enter to confirm no other recipients. This is what the console looked like:    You did not specify a user ID. (you may use ""-r"")Current recipients:Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: Agora Onegpg: (Expunged): There is no assurance this key belongs to the named userpub  (Expunged)/(Expunged) Agora One Primary key fingerprint: (Expunged)      Subkey fingerprint: (Expunged)It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person namedin the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,you may answer the next question with yes.Use this key anyway? (y/N) yCurrent recipients:(Expunged)/(Expunged) ""Agora One""Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line: I just added this key from agora, so I am well aware that it is the actual user ID, therefore I can trust it, and input  y and preceded on. Needing no other recipients, I simply hit enter and let the program compile an encrypted message.   Upon completion, the file  encMessage.asc was generated. When opened with a text editor, the PGP message was shown. This is the message which I would send to the recipient, in this case it would be the Agora staff.   ===Decrypting a message=== So at this stage you can now generate your own keys, and send messages to others using their keys. The only thing left is to decrypt a message when a user messages you. This is the text  Hello World! when encrypted using the  WhatEverNameYouWant public key:  -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG 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=gL3V-----END PGP MESSAGE-----Decrypting this is a relatively painless and simple process. First I saved the message to a text file titled  myEncMessage.asc. Once there I entered the following command:  gpg --decrypt myEncMessage.ascwhere  myEncMessage.asc is the name of the file with the message in it. This command will have it output the message into the console, if you want it to be placed into a file instead, use the following command:  gpg --output myDecMessage.txt --decrypt myEncMessage.ascWhere  myDecMessage.txt is the name of the file to export the message to.  The decryption process requires accessing the private key; for this reason, you must provide the password you created when generating the keypair. During the process a prompt will appear, fill in the password and it will decrypt. Here is the output of the command with no output file specified:  You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key foruser: ""WhatEverNameYouWant""4096-bit RSA key, ID , created 2014-12-12 (main key ID)gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID , created 2014-12-12      ""WhatEverNameYouWant""Hello World! Notice how a recipient is never specified, this is because the ciphertext can be linked to a key automatically. If the user has a message and the appropriate key to decipher it, GnuPG will find it on it's own.   ===Kudos=== Here are a few extra useful commands that the GNU Privacy Guard provides:   gpg --list-keysThis command lists all public keys stored on the machine.   gpg --list-secret-keysThis command will do the same, but with private keys.  If you want to change a key to a trusted one, enter the following command:  gpg --edit-key WhatEverNameYouWant The following will then appear:   gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.26; Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.Secret key is available.pub  4096R/(Expunged) created: 2014-12-25  expires: 2015-12-25  usage: SC                     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimatesub  4096R/(Expunged) created: 2014-12-25  expires: 2015-12-25  usage: E[ultimate] (1).

WhatEverNameYouWant And that's that.   ===Wrapping Up=== This tutorial taught the fundamental usage of using assymetric encryption via a terminal/command prompt. Although more time consuming and tedious, I consider it advantageous over a graphical user interface. Using a GUI such as kleopatra for windows enables the user to see keys and click to interact with them, however it imposes restrictions such as forcing the user to enter an Email address. Using a terminal also ensures you know exactly what is happening to the keypair, and have full control. There's positives and negatives to using both.

I would disagree with adding Russia Today to that list though. They are a propaganda weapon owned, operated, and funded by the Russian government. That's public information too. Honestly, I avoid their articles like the plague, even if I agree with the premise of the article. They've been known to mix in very convincing half-truths and lies into their articles to advance Russian foreign policy.   Let's talk about the lesser of two evils for a minute. If the choice is between corporate media vs government media, I would choose corporate media every time, especially if the government in question is a former communist dictatorship that slaughtered millions of its own people. It's funny how Russia used to murder people for political dissent in their own country (and they'll still throw you in jail for it. The former chess world champion, Gary Kasparov can attest to that ), and now they run a news site that encourages political dissent in western countries. Stay away from Russia Today guys, it's a trap.  Personally, I think VICE does some damn good reporting. Even if I don't agree with the perspective the journalist takes, I would rather the information I recieve be accurate so I can make up my own damn mind. A lot of these ""alternative"" news sites don't really give you a balanced, un-biased, statement of the facts. I have a ton of respect for journalists who go to battlefields and war-torn countries to give you the news. Anyway, I'm ranting again.

The owner of Fox is definitely acting in his own self/Republican interests. However, I would argue that RT's motives are much more sinister: political destabilization of the West, especially the USA.    I'm not saying that I do trust corporate media, but if the alternative is government media... yeah, that's a pretty horrible alternative. If the US had no privately owned media, all government media, then there would never be any stories about government screw-ups. How do you think government media would have handled the Snowden leaks? The fact that media is privately owned and not directly accountable to the government is an extremely important protection.  Also, while we're on the subject of how badly corporate media sucks... When people talk about how corporate media is biased, what they really mean is Fox. While I don't disagree, it really irritates me when people complain about Fox and fail to mention MSNBC, which is definitely just as bad. I get the sense that people on forums like this lean pretty far to the left, so maybe they think that MSNBC's blunders are somehow less sinful? I don't know, but MSNBC is definitely the left wing version of Fox.   Let me give you an example of my favorite MSNBC fuck-up.  http://newsbusters.org/blogs/kyle-drennen/2009/08/18/msnbc-no-mention-black-gun-owner-among-racist-protesters  In MSNBC's attempt to make everyone who leans to the right on economic issues look like a racist, they actually edited the footage of a black man legally open carrying a rifle at a healthcare reform rally to make him look white. Then, they talked about how everyone at that rally is racist, and how that man exercising legal open carry was also racist.     I agree with all of what you just said here. This shit needs to fucking stop. I don't know how we're gonna reverse this trend, since neither the Democrats or the Republicans seem to want to do anything about it.  If you're an American, and you want to reverse this trend, you better vote for Rand Paul in 2016. I can't agree with everything this guy does, but he's the only hopeful presidential candidate that actually wants the government to stop spying on you.  The United States has definitely become tyrrany that it set out to destroy in the Cold Wars.","I would argue, ""So what?"" At least we know who owns, funds, and operates it, and thereby have at least some idea as to what their biases might be. There are several excellent programs on RT: Thom Hartmann's ""The Big Picture"", Abby Martin's ""Breaking the Set"", and Larry King's ""Politicking"" to name just a few. I would argue that RT is far better than Fox News, to name just one example. Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch, and one of the Saudi princes (whose name I cannot immediately remember.) ;Quote from: Claptrap on February 17, 2015, 06:43:23 amHonestly, I avoid their articles like the plague, even if I agree with the premise of the article. They've been known to mix in very convincing half-truths and lies into their articles to advance Russian foreign policy. Fair enough, but do you somehow think that the same doesn't go on in the Western media as well? Much the same criticisms have been levelled-against Fox News (with respect to mixing in half-truths and lies to advance the Republican/U.S. agenda.) Quote from: Claptrap on February 17, 2015, 06:43:23 amLet's talk about the lesser of two evils for a minute. If the choice is between corporate media vs government media, I would choose corporate media every time, especially if the government in question is a former communist dictatorship that slaughtered millions of its own people. If you trust corporate media, then you are a fool. What about German media? Germany had a regime that slaughtered millions of people, many of them its own citizens -- are you saying that you distrust the German media as well? It is the richest of ironies that some of those (Jacob Appelbaum/Laura Poitras) working/reporting on the Snowden stories feel they can no longer work in the United States, due to U.S. government harassment. Both Poitras and Appelbaum now live in Germany, while Glenn Greenwald lives in Brazil. ;On Tuesday, MSNBCâs Contessa Brewer fretted over health care reform protesters legally carrying guns: ""A man at a pro-health care reform rally...wore a semiautomatic assault rifle on his shoulder and a pistol on his hip....there are questions about whether this has racial overtones....white people showing up with guns."" Brewer failed to mention the man she described was black.Following Brewerâs report, which occurred on the Morning Meeting program, host Dylan Ratigan and MSNBC pop culture analyst Toure discussed the supposed racism involved in the protests. Toure argued: ""...there is tremendous anger in this country about government, the way government seems to be taking over the country, anger about a black person being president....we see these hate groups rising up and this is definitely part of that."" Ratigan agreed: ""...then they get the variable of a black president on top of all these other things and thatâs the move â the cherry on top, if you will, to the accumulated frustration for folks.""Not only did Brewer, Ratigan, and Toure fail to point out the fact that the gun-toting protester that sparked the discussion was black, but the video footage shown of that protester was so edited, that it was impossible to see that he was black. The man appeared at a health care rally outside of President Obamaâs speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Phoenix, Arizona. ;Go outside the accepted systemic norms, as the Occupy movement did, and then you will see some reaction by the government, typically gassings, beatings, and the imposition of criminal charges on the perceived leadership (usually felonies.)  A lot of people have questioned ""Why is it that there is not more of a popular uprising against the current system?"" The short answer is, that if you should do so, you will be made to pay for it. One poster on Slashdot (tombeard) put it very eloquently, when they said: Quote from: tombeard""Protesting in the 60s didn't get you stuck on a ""no fly"" list, blackballed from schools and corporate jobs and unable to get a security clearance. In a few years it will prevent you from getting medical care, which is cool if your 20 but sucks when your 50. Maybe Visa and MC will decide you are persona-non-grata and you can't buy food and such. No bank accounts, you might be a terrorist and in any event you are on the list."" ""The state has drastically raised the price of protest and disobedience. It is an insidious truth that further enslaves us."" Much used to be made about the former Soviet Union: how free speech was suppressed, travel restricted, etc. Take a look at modern America: Quote from: Clio2""I mean, 10 years ago I would not have believed authorities in this country would deny American citizens the right to fly, without due process; start a ""pre-emptive"" war, wiretap everybody with no warrant, force travelers through official gropes or naked scans, demand ""papers"" within 100 miles of any border, or lock up an American citizen (or anybody else) indefinitely without charges."" -- Clio2 At one time, particularly when I was growing-up, it was widely accepted that there was no freedom of expression in the Soviet Union. Even facilities like libraries were subject to surveillance -- in particular, the authorities could force the library to divulge which books you had taken out, or read. This was held- up as a prime example of the perfidy of the Soviet system.  Today, in America, my understanding is that many libraries now have signs posted that warn partrons that their reading habits are subject to scrutiny under the auspices of the Patriot Act. (For this, and many other reasons, the U.S. no longer holds the moral highground.)"

The difference between Soviet/Russian suppression of political dissent, and that carried out in the United States, is that the Soviets/Russians were/are rather more open about it. The United States (and the rest of the West) by contrast, were/are rather more subtle about it.    In the United States, one is freely allowed to hold differing political views, provided that they fall into 'acceptable' boxes, usually labeled Democratic and Republican. (There are fringe parties, but by and large, they don't count, so support for these is mostly ignored.)

The problem we have is, that we have to take the journalist's word for it -- we are forced to trust them.    I seem to recall that that General Electric was part-owner of NBC at one time.

Is the aim of propping up the current status quo in the US  better than opposing that status quo and attempting to change it? If you believe that, then yeah, just watch US corporate news, it doesn't really matter which channel you watch because the conversation takes place within a certain (and narrow) spectrum.  I hate to defend the Russian state, because why would anyone ever fucking do that... but, the reality is that since the end of the cold war the US and NATO have taken a very aggressive stance toward Russia, encroaching closer and closer to their borders despite post-Cold War promises not to. The fact that Russia would support movements (such as Occupy) that if successful would likely lead to a less aggressive foreign policy toward Russia, is a coincidental fact about a nasty and violent state (tends to be true of superpowers, always). And it means that it's coverage of movements and protests, such as Occupy, is going to take place outside of the narrow spectrum of discussion that exists within US news.  You're trying to make this an issue of public vs private, but that's really not relavant, because Russia is essentially a dictatorship. The BBC in the UK is respected, and a lot better than its private competitors in the UK, and especially the US. Still, it has its own narrow spectrum in which discussion takes place. Just like RT does.   It depends  which government, and  which corporate media. Glenn Greenwald and Ed Snowden are confident that no mainstream news organisation other than the Guardian would have done what was needed, and they were surprised when it did. So, that's zero corporate media in the US being capable of doing what was needed.  On the other hand, Russia Today would have gone with it harder than the Guardian.  And this demonstrates the point. What matters is the paramaters of discussion. Russia Today has  some good programs and interviews, with serious people, about real world events, who would never be heard like that in the West.  But  obviously if you want to know about the horrible shit that's happening in Russia, or  its protest movements, you're looking in the wrong place. And their format is a bit Fox News-ish, and they have some damn stupid stuff sometimes.   The corporate media focuses on debate within a very narrow spectrum, with any dissent being heard taking place within it. It benefits those in power, both the state and the corporation, whose interests at this point have all but merged. US State TV News, if controlled to the extent that Russia controls RT, would look pretty much exactly like the current set up now.  Also, The Real News Network is great.

Zaphod     ","OPSEC/ComputerThe Force Briefing: LE DNM investigative methods & resourcessubmitted 6 hours ago * by gwernhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/336p83/the_force_briefing_le_dnm_investigative_methods/ (clearnet)The recent filings in the Ulbricht case relating to the Force/Bridges corruption case make for interesting reading, especially the DEA internal timeline detailing the infighting (and revealing 2 new CIs) and Ross Ulbricht's 'counterintel' file (PDF of screenshots, transcribed text version).The counterintel file turns out to contain Force's initial emails corresponding with Ulbricht, in exchange for the initial retainer of $5k or whatever in June-August 2013. While a bit rambling, the emails constitute a fairly thorough briefing on the progress up to then, investigative methods and level of monitoring of the DNMs, internal politics, motivations, and limitations of the investigations into SR1. Force reveals, among other things:* LE does actively compile lists of buyer addresses either from cooperating sellers or outright buying them; this strategy has not yielded many results though* a number of buyers have been so worried about threats to dox them on forums that they have run into the loving arms of LE* the investigations were largely sparked by Chuck Schumer's 2011 grandstanding, and were otherwise not a big priority* the DEA investigation was surprisingly poorly-funded, tech-illiterate, unmotivated, and juvenile; the FBI seems to be much more technologically sophisticated.* all the markets and forums are actively monitored/scraped, but by a very small team who can't go into much detail for each* a handful of the DoS attacks were done by the NCIJTF/FBI, testing SR1, but do not seem to have been attempts to use the known de-anonymization attacks* As of August 2013, the investigations had made almost no real progress in finding Ulbricht (and the timeline indicates they had wasted huge amounts of time on Mark Karpeles & Athavale); it seems that Curtis Green and then Tarbell's mysterious de-anonymization of the Icelandic servers were huge breakthroughs* flipped vendors cannot, as a matter of DoJ policy, sell large quantities drugs for a long time; hence they will tend to go in a blaze of glory, start faking feedback, or quasi-retire with a low level of targeted undercover sales to attack specific buyers (especially gun and poison buyers)* Atlantis was (as probably is obvious by now) legitimate and not a honeypot. (I know, most of you don't even know what Atlantis is, but the old-timers will appreciate the closure.)* the domestic Bitcoin exchanges were fighting cooperating, MtGox was surprisingly safe, and Coinbase was actively rolling over to hand over user information (and PayPal but we knew that)* as long theorized, guns are huge red flag and single out a market for special attention and investigative effort; BMR was badly penetrated even in mid-2013, and despite all the BMR cases which have become public, Force's briefing indicates even more are still unknownThe excerpts: Know that some of your vendors have been approached for (and have provided for money) buyer information (the idea is to purchase buyer information, which gets dumped and collated into excel). Vendors that get banned are approached via the email addresses they provide on their pages ""in the event SR is down, contact here.."". Just recently a New York based pill guy sold his entire customer list to what he thought was atlantis. Can find out his handle so you can poke around old private messages if need be. Several uses for databases of buyer information...Vendors HAVE been approached off-site (most list their tormails on their pages) for customer information. This has been bought. Then collected and dumped. It has mostly been vendors who have vanished/been banned/ or slowed down. They're deemed to be the most vulnerable. This is not pursued as much due to a poor ROI. Most vendors/former vendors have not entertained such advances and those who have have demanded funds that simply are not available even in the discretitionary account(s). Like any other government effort/agency/JTF, funds are near impossible to get approved & released. Even undercover buys require paperwork and approval. There is no joint kitty of BTC available to make purchases from every vendor. It would take 2-3 days to get funds released for anything, and approvals are not that easy to obtain AFAIK. And in any case in this scenario, verifying information would be a nightmare. No guarantee that they would not just copy and paste names from the phonebook or use a name generating site. No real benefit other then to identify potential bulk buyers who would resell IRL (and this information would get kicked down to state/local). ...Am certain there are not many techies involved. Due to the unconventional nature of this network and technology, not much use for full time ""geeks"" being sourced & assigned anything more then standard workload. Unless there's some specific technical question/explanation needed ...Again, something you would probably be able to verify - maybe half a year ago a guy from podunk Virginia contacted local and was crying about being blackmailed for his personal information by 'anonymous criminals' (Phil something). Middle aged guy who ran a travel agency. Even down to that level pops up on the radar nearby to where the birdie hangs out. Did not take long to assemble the backstory (small time recreational buyer just got blackmailed if you want to call it that by a crooked vendor) and dismiss as utterly irrelevant. I'm sure old private messages or communications can be examined to verify that instance. ...Prominent on the radar is Silk Road (amongst other known sites/actors on TOR) and since late 2011 there's been a lackluster yet interagency effort to monitor, disrupt, infiltrate and/or penetrate operations. The office of the DAAG (Deputy Assistant Attorney General) Computer Crime (at time Jason Weinstein) was the principal in spearheading. This is after Sen. Schumer & party created a hoo-ha. Weinsteins office jumped to take charge and assume oversight. Under the auspices of the NCIJTF (National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force which is DOJ), the following fed agencies have a presence when it comes to SR (Stateside) 1) DEA 2) FBI 3) DHS 4) ICE 5) USPIS 6) ATF 7) CBP    That should NOT worry you, because by ""presence"" I only mean their are active agents and officer level involvement from who's resources are pooled and budgets are shared. On a limb I'll say this, everything having to do with Silk Road (like any other open set of investigations) is on shared drives that almost all can read+write, and there is a shared public Outlook folder where all emails/correspondence pertaining to SR are routed. Everybody (and I mean everybody) from entry level up to the heavens have ""read"" access. Additionally, people talk a LOT. Loose lips is an understatement and the level of immaturity and juvenile attitude is staggering. There is no such thing as ""confidential"", and this is a culture where people are numb. You must understand that part of why I'm so confident (in my ability to maintain this relationship) is that nothing is treated as sacred and there are probably 100 people like me who could offer the same level of access. Analysts do collate data and prepare summarizations/status sheets and CC the requisite list/group.. and majority of the time nothing happens. Little to none replies/discussion. This is not SR specific, but does include SR. For example reports related to CP sites/forums or BMR often get the same treatment.. ambivalence. Here is something that will bring a smile to your face.. it is just not in the budgets to aggressively dedicate resources to SR. The way the budgets are allocated are almost certainly political in nature, and the lions share goes to War on Terrorism or ""real world"" drug activity. That's the cold hard truth. That's not to say that there are no zealots who do have a harden for SR related activity, but that is more focused on suspected real world trafficking. Ironically enough, guys at USPIS do not care in the least about SR. Yes you read that right. They're broke and have no concept of tech savvy.. and frankly, they are not interested. DEA guys often initiate most chatter having to do with SR, yet follow up is minimum and they are too bogged down in pending investigations of subjects whom they have the ability to surveil and/or who's circle they can infiltrate by way of CI's (conf informants).. none of which is possible when dealing with a beast that is virtually immune to real world surveillance. It's not a question of getting warrants to ISPs.. its a question of who/where to begin looking. They're stuck.    At the analyst level, SR forums and the main site are crawled/monitored. Not more then 4 people are tasked with just crawling and mining the forums main site in an observational capacity. These 4 people are also tasked with crawling and mining many other websites and forums on TOR and clear net. So while everything is printed, you can guesstimate the scrutinity level is not extraordinary. That's not to say that others do not actively surf the forums and maintain both buyer and vendor accounts on the main site, they do. But at any given time, there are not more then a handful of people overseeing a crawl. When something deemed highly interesting or important pops up, they will CC the SR mailing list with a description and screenshot with their thoughts. Otherwise, there is a weekly status sheet that gets dumped with the most relevant/interesting/useful occurrences on the forum along with a summary on value/suggested ""action items"". Everything you post (along with the time stamps) is copied. You are referred to as DPR across the board. Often there is nothing interesting, and if there is there is it would be a bullet point such as ""Vendor XYZ (who deals in ABC..) said his packaging methods consist of 123"" etc. This is so they seem like they're doing their job as often there is nothing interesting at all taking place on the forum side. When moderators quote you, that is often the bulk of what gets bullet pointed ""DPR has instructed us to do such and such"". Now, there have and continue to be attempts to compromise staff accounts (on the forum and main side) by the normal methods of password guessing, but AFAIK none have been successful. There have been successful instances of cloning lookalike accounts which have all been shut down on your side. Of significant focus is attempts to impersonate you and your moderators on not only SR mainsite/forum, but on other TOR sites such as BMR or Atlantis to see if any prior correspondences can be restarted. Nothing there either.    ...There HAVE been concentrated efforts to DoS/DdoS the site and forum to assess your response time and technical acumen. I'm not too savvy regarding this, but on a horizontal scope there have been/are attempts to run exit notes [exit nodes] and track traffic across TOR. To what end this has been aimed at SR would be something I would need to poke around about...6) Yes. I can poke around more, but in short - yes. What the end-goal was, I'm not sure. What they assessed, I'm not sure. But further attempts on the integrity of the site will be executed, be sure of that. Although I can tell you, that won't be a long term play. It can't be sustained forever...The DDoS would certainly be NCIJTF/FBI.    ...The high-vol vendor operations such as (to just name a few) Nod, NorCalKing, RxKing are all under scrutiny. They've all been purchased from multiple times and general geographic location is assembled. For example it would be known that the Nod operation is NY, NCK is in California, RxK is Southwest US etc. There are also ongoing attempts to befriend the 'biggish' vendors through private message/forum pm/privnote/pgp and take correspondence off-site. This is where off-site deals and 'partnerships' would get cooked up and layers of anonymity be peeled away, leading to more detailed profiles. No high volume US vendor has been surveilled. On a state level, several suspected major vendors have been surveilled, yet none have been touched as that won't happen till a multi-jurisdiction plan to move on several vendors simultaneously in a grand slam display is logistically possible let alone greenlit. AFAIK, something of that magnitude would not be possible currently. There have been one-off prosecutions on county and state levels. What happens is that a vendor that has confidently profiled/ascertained to be originating packages out of a certain jurisdiction, that information is shared down to local/state to put eyeballs on. A lot of that was happening in the beginning, but now there's more of a ""hands off"" approach. They'd want to sweep the maximum amount of vendors at once. Having the Sheriff of Mayberry hit one based on JTF Intel is just not the culture/mindset. Nearly all efforts are conducted out of Jersey and Los Angeles.    ...Posing as vendors - yes. That has happened. Although, DOJ attorneys will never ever allow drugs to 'walk' en masse. Especially after scandals such as Fast and Furious where the guns were allowed to walk.. they simply can not introduce narcotics into circulation. Vendor accounts have been bought to gain access to that side of the site and Vendor Roundtable and to establish longterm credibility, but any ""purchases"" would be absolutely fake and bought by their own accounts to build credible stats. Pm sure on state level there have been targeted vendor-posed operations to net bulk buyers, but those are highly controlled and short term. I have not heard of any of the top of my head. That does NOT mean that is not currently happening or will not happen in the future, but any significant bust would have made waves.    ...One thing to be cognizant of, there's a lean on the domestic BTC exchanges to cooperate. There have been informal discussions in the last few months to develop working relationship with Coinbase (I know for a fact). After DHS hit Gox, even the boogeyman of a FinCEN violation is enough to mortify any of the btc guys. Anyone moving large sums of BTC will be open to scrutiny. I reference Coinbase because I know there was a series of meetings with Compliance at Coinbase. That can only mean one thing& BUT, that does not mean that the full on arm twisting by Treasury is going to be utilized to track black market vendors. They're more concerned (and justify) their desire for access due to terrorism. Most of the black market economy is essentially low hanging fruit in comparison to terror funding. But if OC activity is disrupted and theres political mileage for DoJ, the wide dragnet serves a multi faceted purpose.    1) a) BMR is on the radar and that is ATF's baby. Politics plays a significant role in prioritization of which agency gets to own which investigations. The climate is aggressive when it comes to weapons trafficking and with the gun control hot potato has guaranteed virtually a carte blanche to ATF. And they have deep pockets as well. Because tor based weapons traffickers are almost always running guns IRL, there is synergy between federal and state. Federal approves staggering sums of money for surveillance,undercover and CI's. I don't want to say BMR is ""infiltrated"", but there are a lot of compromised accounts and there have been a few quiet busts. Nearly every bust has resulted in cooperation. I am not sure what the long play is, but as long as this current administration is in power the gunrunners will always be hard targets. They are intimidated with the threat of tangible charges (interstate trafficking, conspiracy, organized crime, distribution) and they ALL cooperate. The general consensus is that weapons dealers are not sophisticated and have a lot of IRL visibility, so they are ALWAYS on the radar.    ...c) HackBB and TCF are prominent and actively surveilled. Have not heard of any significant operations that have netted any majors, but there have been some successful prosecutions/interagency wins. HackBB especially is monitored closely. There is another counterfeit site whose name escapes me now, but there was a major sting that happened in Boston last winter which was a result of efforts focused on it. Paypal was involved and was very accommodating to SS in handing over logs.    ...8) Some, yes. Off the top of my head - I know that ""Costco"" is a West Coast operation and theres some fair certainty that it's an Asian gang deal. There is an immigration element and tied to IRL dealing. I'm not sure what the wait is, but there's some play that probably involves state/local. ""Marlostansfield"" is NYC, and the guy has a lengthy record and has been a CI in the past. ""Godofall"" is NYC and they're Dominicans who are street level/wholesalers. ""DaRuthless1"" has been surveilled by local in Queens and has a prior for distribution oxy. ""UndergroundSyndicate"" I know was assumed to have been made, but there was some snafu with that and bickering state level. I know there were a few California based pot guys who were being surveilled, I can circle back on vendor information. There is a vendor in Dade County, FL that was surveilled, grabbed and turned but the focus was on his IRL connects to coke wholesalers, not on mail.    [Marlostanfield, Godofall, and DaRuthless1 seem to have disappeared before or during the fall of SR1 and no busts are known to be associated; UnderGroundSyndicate was busted as part of the SuperTrips case; the CA and FL mentions are too vague to judge. Ulbricht in his journal credits Force's info with saving at least one vendor, and it's noteworthy that someone contacted Eileen Ormsby in December 2013 (http://allthingsvice.com/2015/04/02/special-agent-force-alpacino-and-me/), referring to Force's info and telling Ormsby to ""ask M___ how DPR knew stuff that helped him not get busted. He won't know how, but he will know what you are talking about""; Marlostanfield is the only vendor named in the entire file whose name begins with ""M"" and if he had already run afoul of the law many times, he would be quick to disappear upon being warned.]    ...Now, when Gox was hit in the spring.. that was literally over an unchecked box on some form asking ""Are you a money transmitter?""! Because (the US subsidiary) of Gox failed to check the ""Yes"" box.. that alone was enough to get a judge to sign off on a warrant. The rest is history. LE has reached out to EVERY SINGLE DOMESTIC btc exchange and asked them to share records on vague grounds (ongoing narco-traffic investigations, Islamic charities/donations etc) and establish channels. The exchanges seem to talk to each other, and have by large put a united front and rebuffed these advances so far and have insisted their Ts are crossed and I's are dotted, which means they are not obligated to share records with any LEA on gratis. And since their paperwork is in order, LE is stuck here. They have not been enable to find cause to hit any of the other exchanges the way they hit Gox. I can tell you that LE is so used to banks bending over backwards to accommodate, they're annoyed that the exchanges have not rolled over. They have not seized servers of any domestic btc exchange. Even Mutum Sigillum's seizure was just their Dwolla account, not their servers or any stateside Gox data. Coinbase, however, is probably playing ball at some level. If you recall they scored like $5mil in a Series A round a few months ago. Few weeks after that (I'm talking June), there were meetings between there Compliance/attorneys and Treasury. This is not public knowledge. Either this was the investors insisting that they reach out to the feds and get in their good graces, or Treasury tried to squeeze them and maybe found something they thought they could use to bully them. But that's been quiet since. Have not heard anything. Gut says they probably reached some tentative agreement to pass on records in a limited capacity. Long story short, no, they are not tapped in to the exchanges (yet), aside from possibly Coinbase. ...About Gox: No way. Hitting Mutum Sig was a last resort and reactionary because they had approached Gox directly and were rebuffed, and then reached out to the Japanese government to no avail. Although on good relations, Japanese companies are very anal when it comes to perceived threats to their bottom line. Must not forget that Gox is fully aware that that a staggering amount of traffic is dirty money (no offense), and that makes them money. They can't fathom turning over records and data to the Americans without a crippling mass exodus of capital (if it ever came to light). Also Japanese are a proud people when it comes to their work. There are free trade agreements with Japan that have binding clauses to provide financial information to requests from say the IRS, but something that like can't be used as a tool with the Japanese government because of limited resources and approvals on our end. It's very beauracratic and not just a matter of a few phone calls and emails. And even still the Japanese can stall and pushback. As long as Gox is operating where they are, they will guard the integrity of their records/logs/data. Gox is outside the tentacles. "

Also, any markets that have previously been affected can use the new -zapwallettxes to fix the balances in the wallet that have been affected by the tx malleability issue.  This is my attempt at explaining how I think MtGox / SR2 got their coins stolen:  Imagine bitcoins are dollar bills in your wallet for a second. You have $42, made up of $20, 2 $10, and 2 $1. Now say you buy something for $18.   In the old bitcoin world, your account balance would be easy to compute: $42 - 18 = $24. Cool, mark your wallet balance as $24. And this is what it did, when it sent the transaction out, your wallet balance would just update straight to $24. However, this is not how the protocol (or how real money) actually works.  When you want to spend $18, what you actually have to do is give the cashier (or in this case, the miner) a $20. This means, for a small period of time (until the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain), your wallet balance is actually LOWER than what a simple subtraction would have you believe. In reality, for a small period of time, your wallet balance is actually $22 instead of $24. This is because the cashier (miner) needs to take your $20, split it, and give you back the change. Now, this is a pretty fatal flaw in Bitcoin, because with the simple subtraction method, it means that I can actually spend $2 that I don't actually have in my wallet. Now from here, I'm not 100% sure exactly how they pulled this off, but it involves moving money between one account and another on the same server and spending the ""moved"" transaction in the other account while the change transaction is still taking place. This is when the change transaction is ""mutated"", and all the change spent becomes invalid. This is what fucked up the account balances on everyone's bitcoind.  Anyway, by moving to using spendzeroconfchange, the balance in your account temporarily goes down until the change is given back to you by the miner. That way no money is spent that cannot yet be accounted for.",""

Steps: 1. copy the code and replace 'PRIVATE_KEY_A' and 'PRIVATE_KEY_B' with buyer's and vendor's private keys. 2. run the code in Bitcoin-QT to get the signed raw transaction code 3. use sendrawtransaction {raw transaction code}; funds sent  In regards to the TX malleability issue, the mutant TXs usually just get bounced around - and doesn't usually cause any harm but *could* have potential problems.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think the real issue was that Mt. Gox was using their own custom built Bitcoin wallet which produces transactions that get rejected, mutating the transactions.  This coupled with the fact they rely on TXIDs to check for transactions messes up their system since they can't find the transactions, so they end up double spending.  In general, it's not good to rely solely on TXID to check for confirmations on transactions.  Let me know if I'm off about anything.  Also, let me know your comments and feedback on the forum; any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers, MDParity",""

We will never join unless","General Discussion/Security","I just want to reiterate some explanations in math, just in case you still don't understand.  every transaction = different public/private key  as a result, only one transaction can be stolen per private key submitted  Let's say a buyer submits their private key, and the market steals the funds, here is a calculation of the gains/loss:  Assume that market has 100 members, each conducting 0.1 BTC transaction a day, for just a period of a month. That's 10BTC in transactions a day in purchases, and market earns 1%:   Transaction                     Market commission 10BTC * 1% * 30 days = 0.3 BTC   Scam 1 Transaction 0.1 BTC = 0.1 BTC  The market scams 0.1BTC, and now loses all future transactions from buyers/vendors .  What is the gain/loss?  dx/dy where y->? = BTC   (BTC comes only once for an infinitive time) 0.1BTC / a month -> infinity (loss of trust forever) = 0 BTC   (BTC keeps coming in for an infinitive time) 0.3BTC ->infinity / a month ->infinity = 0.03 BTC  The first equation -> means as the limit approaches.  Instead of looking at the rate/month, lets do a simple annual calculation:  0.1 BTC / 1 year = 0.1 BTC / year 0.3 BTC * 12 month / 1 year = 3.6 BTC / year  Do you see the difference?  In traditional escrow, the outlook is more along the lines of scamming all escrow at the same time:  Steal total BTC: 10 BTC transaction a day  Earn commission: 3.6 BTC / year  As can be seen, in the traditional non-multi-sig escrow system, I steal 1 days worth of BTC, it'll be worth even more than an entire years worth of BTC in commission.  Hence, this is why multi-sig escrow is important.  In my implementation, it's called risk mitigation through gain/loss calculation.  Cheers, MDParity  ",""

We will never join unless","General Discussion/Security"," UPDATE:  I reread what you wrote; in every system, there are always exploits.  However, the idea is to mitigate risks to a recoverable level.  In terms of security, there are two rules:  1. Prevention - if you can prevent a system from being compromised, then none of this would happen 2. Recovery - if a system does become compromised, the system needs to be able to recover the losses  #1 is the most important - an ounce of prevention is worth a pound in medication  However, my system meets both criterias.  If a single transaction is stolen, it can be recovered, as you stated yourself, the scopes of risks is limited.  There is no 100% secure or perfect system.  This does not exist.  Just the best possible solution at the time, until someone else finds a better one.   UPDATE:   In regards to confirming the redeemScript; I thought about this before.  In reality, all you need is all three public keys to confirm everything.  However, this would require buyer/vendor to learn how to manually create multi-sig addresses, create the transaction, sign it, and spend it.  This is a lot of steps in terms of commands.  I could provide all 3 public keys for the more technical members - then everything could be verified.  Just as a note, not everyone looks forward to running commands in a console every time there is a transaction.  ----- You obviously don't know what you are talking about.  The flaws you point out does not exist.  There is no escrow  wallet.  I've already tried and put in considerable time to explain to you like a 5 year old.  The funds are in an address created by the 3 public keys in the blockchain, for a 2 of 3 transaction.   THERE IS NO WALLET  The spend transaction occurs the moment the private key is entered.  You can compromise the entire framework, and you won't get anything.  The most you could is steal 1 TRANSACTION if a member submitted the private key, because at that moment, someone would say ""where'd the funds go?""  In addition, to attempt to even STEAL/HIJACK a private key YOU NEED TO BE ROOT or PRIVILEGED USER WITH WRITE PERMISSION.  That's a lot of work to steal 1 transaction and if a system was hijacked at a root level, I don't think that 1 transaction should be their primary concern.  No hacker would ever waste that much time to hack a system to steal a single transaction, unless it was a personal vendetta.   Unless all members submit their private keys at the same time + the hacker hacks the system at the same time.  And to what purpose is there to fake a redeemScript?  The buyer/vendor can't access the funds, but I won't have the private keys to access it neither.  So that defeats the entire purpose of the fake redeemScript.  Build an entire market with 1000+ members just to troll them?  You think that anyone has that kind of time on their hand?  You obviously don't understand risk mitigation and probabilities.  I never said my system was more secure than TMP; I said it's a compromise between safety and ease of use.  All purchases include a ""Manual FE code"" to finalize outside of BlackBank.  You don't need to give BlackBank the private key.  So here's the difference:  TMP - no private key needs to be provided to the server   BlackBank - no private key needs to be provided to the server UNLESS you want it to be easier  One has an extra option.  Cheers, MDParity  PS.  I think TMP has a great and secure system; they are obviously cryptography experts.  The problem is they expect all the buyers and vendors to be one too.  I can obviously tell you are bias to TMP.  No hard feelings.",""

Gox was using their own custom built Bitcoin wallet which produces transactions that get rejected, mutating the transactions.  This coupled with the fact they rely on TXIDs to check for transactions messes up their system since they can't find the transactions, so they end up double spending.  In general, it's not good to rely solely on TXID to check for confirmations on transactions.Let me know if I'm off about anything.  Also, let me know your comments and feedback on the forum; any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Cheers,MDParity"

As you can see, you can check the address belongs to your public key through the above info.  There are addresses + 2 sigs are required = 2 of 3 multi-sig.

In terms of tumbling, the fact that the hot wallet is shared, when funds enter BlackBank's wallet, then back out to the p2sh address, it could possibly mix the coins already in between.  Of course, the way it's set up, it's not absolute.  Ex.                                         shared mix Buyer A : deposit 10BTC ----\                         /-----> multisig 2/3 address -----> Vendor A  Buyer B : deposit 10BTC ----+---> 30BTC ---->+-----> multisig 2/3 address -----> Vendor B Buyer C : deposit 10BTC ----/                         \-----> multisig 2/3 address -----> Vendor C  (I apologize for the poor flow chart; I'm not an ascii artist)  Cheers, MDParity","how does the buyer get the funds back if seller turns out to be a scammer?;how does buyer confirm the multi sig addresses keys are indeed what you will claim they are (i.e. they require 2 and has 3).;how does he/she verify the output address of the p2sh script etc?"

Read the Wiki for BlackBank Multi-Sig Escrow: http://u5z75duioy7kpwun.onion/wiki/index.php/Multi-Sig_Escrow  When an order is finalized, it doesn't return to BlackBank; it pays directly to the address provided by the vendor/buyer for payment/refunds, not back to BlackBank.   The public/private keys should not be reused. It's a per transaction basis - so the moment the private key is submitted - the funds are deposited into the address of the buyer/vendor; there's nothing to steal.  This prevents the market from running away with all Escrows in transaction at the same time, unless miraculously every single buyer submits there private key at exactly the same time.  It is not profitable to steal funds from a single transaction as opposed to the collective commission earned on total transactions.  This is called risk mitigation; a compromise between security and ease of use.  Do you think any market would scam 1 transaction and forsake every single transaction/vendor/buyer as well as losing their reputation?  I would say such decisions are more often weighed upon when, let's say 4000+ BTC, is the benefit of a scam.  Cheers, MDParity",""

We are working on getting a link set up with i2pmail.org also.  Q. I lost my password. Is there a way to recover it? A. No. There is no way for you to prove to us who you are reliably. Create another account.  Q. Is it possible to change my password? A. Yes. Use the password change tool here.  Q. I no longer need my account. Can I delete it? A. Yes. Use the account delete tool here.  Q. This sounds great. Where do I sign up? A. Really? Click here to sign up. *************************************************  Thanks for the tip, adding to Recommended list. ","Hey everyone Axa damn my man, great job on keeping everyone informed on the mail clients.

The case gives the Obama administration approval to reach into servers abroad.  ""It is a question of control, not a question of the location of that information,"" US District Judge Loretta Preska ruled in a closely followed legal flap. The bench order from the New York judge was stayed pending appeal.  The judge sided with the Obama Administration claims that any company with operations in the United States must comply with valid warrants for data, even if the content is stored overseasâin this case Dublin, Ireland. It's a position Microsoft and companies like Apple contended was wrong, arguing that the enforcement of US law stops at the border.  A magistrate judge had already sided with the government's position, ruling in April that ""the basic principle that an entity lawfully obligated to produce information must do so regardless of the location of that information."" Microsoft appealed to a federal judge, and Preska ruled from the bench after a two-hour hearing Thursday.  Microsoft said [1] in court filings that ""Congress has not authorized the issuance of warrants that reach outside US territory. The government cannot seek and a court cannot issue a warrant allowing federal agents to break down the doors of Microsoftâs Dublin facility.""  The Redmond, Washington-based company said its consumer trust is low in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations. Microsoft told Judge Preska in a filing that the ""government's position in this case further erodes that trust and will ultimately erode the leadership of US technologies in the global market.""  Companies like Apple, AT&T, Cisco, and Verizon agree. Verizon said [2] that a decision favoring the US would produce ""dramatic conflict with foreign data protection laws."" Apple and Cisco said [3] that the tech sector is put ""at risk"" of being sanctioned by foreign governments and that the US should seek cooperation with foreign nations via treaties, a position the US said is not practical.  The Justice Department said global jurisdiction is necessary in an age when ""electronic communications are used extensively by criminals of all types in the United States and abroad, from fraudsters to hackers to drug dealers, in furtherance of violations of US law.""   The e-mail the US authorities are seeking from Microsoft concerns a drug-trafficking investigation. Microsoft often stores e-mail on servers closest to the account holder    [1]  http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/microsoft-challenges-us-govt-warrant-to-access-overseas-customer-data/ [2]  http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/verizonamicus.pdf  [3]  http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/applebriefinremicrosft.pdf  If this doesn't drive home the absolute necessity of using PGP with any email or stored data, then I don't know what will.

Tutanota.de WebMail Selling Points:   Open Source We take security seriously: Peer reviews are essential for any security application. We also want to continue developing Tutanota based on the input of the community. That is why we published Tutanota as Open Source Software, licensed under GPL v3. You can check out our open source project on Github. Closed source applications can not be reviewed and you never know if they contain backdoors.   All-round encryption and zero knowledge We encrypt everything possible: Your entire inbox, your contacts and all other data that you can store in Tutanota (e.g. a calendar will be added in an upcoming release). When you send an end-to-end encrypted email, everything - subject, content and all attachments - is automatically encrypted. We also encrypt the messages that you receive unsecurely from other email providers.   Reach everybody tap-proof We make it possible that you can send an end-to-end encrypted email to any email address easily, for instance to Gmail or Hotmail. Your recipient can directly answer with an encrypted email even if he not yet uses Tutanota.   Made in Germany, hosted in Germany Tutanota has been developed in Germany and all your data is stored on our own hardware in data centers in Germany. Germany is known for its strict laws regarding privacy protection. In fact, the legal situation in Germany is predestined for operating a zero knowledge email system as data preservation is being ruled unconstitutional here. In other countries there are data preservation laws being effective that force email providers to preserve data of their users on a massive scale.   Verified by third parties Tutanota is constantly reviewed by third parties. It has been put to an extensive penetration test by the SySS GmbH which confirms the security of the email encryption software.     ",""

In any case, escrow is problematic.  We've seen enough rip-offs even with established sites -- almost no one trusts escrow anymore. The othe question is: who gets to choose the escrow agent, assuming that it's a third-party?  If the buyer chooses one, the buyer and the escrow agent can collude to defraud the vendor of his money. If the vendor chooses the escrow agent, the vendor and the escrow agent can collude to defraud the buyer of his money.   I'd wager that, on a lot of these .onion sites that purport to offer escrow, the vendor and the escrow service are one and the same.

These include ecstasy, benzodiazepines and new psychoactive substances, so-called âheadshop drugsâ"".Ecstasy refers to MDMA, while benzodiazepines include diazepam or 'Valium'.However, according to The Journal, the act has also been used to outlaw the possession of ketamine, magic mushrooms and other drugs.    @gavreilly Seanad will deal with it tomorrow I have just been advised @campaignforleo    â Jillian van Turnhout (@JillianvT) March 10, 2015    @TheRealHeadshot Only in Ireland, sadly, but you've got 31.5 hours to get here.

""Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet. The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.""The ruling could throw many past convictions into question.""I'm told it's dozens,"" the minister added. ""But I can't say for certain because what they'll have to do now is go thought each individual case and see if the people in question were charged just under this section of the act, or if they were charged with other acts as well.""Update: Varadkar has suggested that supply and sale of controlled drugs remains illegal, though it is not clear what legislation he is basing this on.Update 2: Quite separately, the Irish government might have also accidentally managed to outlaw heterosexual marriage today.@christophhooton "

The hack was perpetrated by a joint unit consisting of operatives from the NSA and its British counterpart Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ. The breach, detailed in a secret 2010 GCHQ document, gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the worldâs cellular communications, including both voice and data.  The company targeted by the intelligence agencies, Gemalto, is a multinational firm incorporated in the Netherlands that makes the chips used in mobile phones and next-generation credit cards. Among its clients are AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and some 450 wireless network providers around the world. The company operates in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing facilities. One of its three global headquarters is in Austin, Texas and it has a large factory in Pennsylvania.  In all, Gemalto produces some 2 billion SIM cards a year. Its motto is âSecurity to be Free.â  With these stolen encryption keys, intelligence agencies can monitor mobile communications without seeking or receiving approval from telecom companies and foreign governments. Possessing the keys also sidesteps the need to get a warrant or a wiretap, while leaving no trace on the wireless providerâs network that the communications were intercepted. Bulk key theft additionally enables the intelligence agencies to unlock any previously encrypted communications they had already intercepted, but did not yet have the ability to decrypt.  As part of the covert operations against Gemalto, spies from GCHQ â with support from the NSA â mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiple countries.  Gemalto was totally oblivious to the penetration of its systems â and the spying on its employees. âIâm disturbed, quite concerned that this has happened,â Paul Beverly, a Gemalto executive vice president, told The Intercept. âThe most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done, so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesnât happen again, and also to make sure that thereâs no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years. What I want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has, or could have, on any of our customers.â He added that âthe most important thing for us now is to understand the degreeâ of the breach.  Leading privacy advocates and security experts say that the theft of encryption keys from major wireless network providers is tantamount to a thief obtaining the master ring of a building superintendent who holds the keys to every apartment. âOnce you have the keys, decrypting traffic is trivial,â says Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union. âThe news of this key theft will send a shock wave through the security community.â  THE MASSIVE KEY THEFT IS âBAD NEWS FOR PHONE SECURITY. REALLY BAD NEWS.â  Beverly said that after being contacted by The Intercept, Gemaltoâs internal security team began on Wednesday to investigate how their system was penetrated and could find no trace of the hacks. When asked if the NSA or GCHQ had ever requested access to Gemalto-manufactured encryption keys, Beverly said, âI am totally unaware. To the best of my knowledge, no.â  According to one secret GCHQ slide, the British intelligence agency penetrated Gemaltoâs internal networks, planting malware on several computers, giving GCHQ secret access. We âbelieve we have their entire network,â the slideâs author boasted about the operation against Gemalto.  Additionally, the spy agency targeted unnamed cellular companiesâ core networks, giving it access to âsales staff machines for customer information and network engineers machines for network maps.â GCHQ also claimed the ability to manipulate the billing servers of cell companies to âsuppressâ charges in an effort to conceal the spy agencyâs secret actions against an individualâs phone. Most significantly, GCHQ also penetrated âauthentication servers,â allowing it to decrypt data and voice communications between a targeted individualâs phone and his or her telecom providerâs network. A note accompanying the slide asserted that the spy agency was âvery happy with the data so far and [was] working through the vast quantity of product.â   The Mobile Handset Exploitation Team (MHET), whose existence has never before been disclosed, was formed in April 2010 to target vulnerabilities in cellphones. One of its main missions was to covertly penetrate computer networks of corporations that manufacture SIM cards, as well as those of wireless network providers. The team included operatives from both GCHQ and the NSA.    While the FBI and other U.S. agencies can obtain court orders compelling U.S.-based telecom companies to allow them to wiretap or intercept the communications of their customers, on the international front this type of data collection is much more challenging. Unless a foreign telecom or foreign government grants access to their citizensâ data to a U.S. intelligence agency, the NSA or CIA would have to hack into the network or specifically target the userâs device for a more risky âactiveâ form of surveillance that could be detected by sophisticated targets. Moreover, foreign intelligence agencies would not allow U.S. or U.K. spy agencies access to the mobile communications of their heads of state or other government officials.  âItâs unbelievable. Unbelievable,â said Gerard Schouw, a member of the Dutch Parliament, when told of the spy agenciesâ actions. Schouw, the intelligence spokesperson for D66, the largest opposition party in the Netherlands, told The Intercept, âWe donât want to have the secret services from other countries doing things like this.â Schouw added that he and other lawmakers will ask the Dutch government to provide an official explanation and to clarify whether the countryâs intelligence services were aware of the targeting of Gemalto, whose official headquarters is in Amsterdam.  Last November, the Dutch government amended its constitution to include explicit protection for the privacy of digital communications, including those made on mobile devices. âWe have, in the Netherlands, a law on the [activities] of secret services. And hacking is not allowed,â Schouw said. Under Dutch law, the interior minister would have to sign off on such operations by foreign governmentsâ intelligence agencies. âI donât believe that he has given his permission for these kind of actions.â  The U.S. and British intelligence agencies pulled off the encryption key heist in great stealth, giving them the ability to intercept and decrypt communications without alerting the wireless network provider, the foreign government or the individual user that they have been targeted. âGaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellular encryption,â says Matthew Green, a cryptography specialist at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute. The massive key theft is âbad news for phone security. Really bad news.â  AS CONSUMERS BEGAN to adopt cellular phones en masse in the mid-1990s, there were no effective privacy protections in place. Anyone could buy a cheap device from RadioShack capable of intercepting calls placed on mobile phones. The shift from analog to digital networks introduced basic encryption technology, though it was still crackable by tech savvy computer science graduate students, as well as the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, using readily available equipment.  Today, second-generation (2G) phone technology, which relies on a deeply flawed encryption system, remains the dominant platform globally, though U.S. and European cellphone companies now use 3G, 4G and LTE technology in urban areas. These include more secure, though not invincible, methods of encryption, and wireless carriers throughout the world are upgrading their networks to use these newer technologies.  It is in the context of such growing technical challenges to data collection that intelligence agencies, such as the NSA, have become interested in acquiring cellular encryption keys. âWith old-fashioned [2G], there are other ways to work around cellphone security without those keys,â says Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer. âWith newer 3G, 4G and LTE protocols, however, the algorithms arenât as vulnerable, so getting those keys would be essential.â  The privacy of all mobile communications â voice calls, text messages and Internet access â depends on an encrypted connection between the cellphone and the wireless carrierâs network, using keys stored on the SIM, a tiny chip smaller than a postage stamp, which is inserted into the phone. All mobile communications on the phone depend on the SIM, which stores and guards the encryption keys created by companies like Gemalto. SIM cards can be used to store contacts, text messages, and other important data, like oneâs phone number. In some countries, SIM cards are used to transfer money. As The Intercept reported last year, having the wrong SIM card can make you the target of a drone strike.  SIM cards were not invented to protect individual communications â they were designed to do something much simpler: ensure proper billing and prevent fraud, which was pervasive in the early days of cellphones. Soghoian compares the use of encryption keys on SIM cards to the way Social Security numbers are used today. âSocial security numbers were designed in the 1930s to track your contributions to your government pension,â he says. âToday they are used as a quasi national identity number, which was never their intended purpose.â  Because the SIM card wasnât created with call confidentiality in mind, the manufacturers and wireless carriers donât make a great effort to secure their supply chain. As a result, the SIM card is an extremely vulnerable component of a mobile phone. âI doubt anyone is treating those things very carefully,â says Green. âCell companies probably donât treat them as essential security tokens. They probably just care that nobody is defrauding their networks.â The ACLUâs Soghoian adds, âThese keys are so valuable that it makes sense for intel agencies to go after them.â  As a general rule, phone companies do not manufacture SIM cards, nor program them with secret encryption keys. It is cheaper and more efficient for them to outsource this sensitive step in the SIM card production process. They purchase them in bulk with the keys pre-loaded by other corporations. Gemalto is the largest of these SIM âpersonalizationâ companies.  After a SIM card is manufactured, the encryption key, known as a âKi,â is burned directly onto the chip. A copy of the key is also given to the cellular provider, allowing its network to recognize an individualâs phone. In order for the phone to be able to connect to the wireless carrierâs network, the phone â with the help of the SIM â authenticates itself using the Ki that has been programmed onto the SIM. The phone conducts a secret âhandshakeâ that validates that the Ki on the SIM matches the Ki held by the mobile company. Once that happens, the communications between the phone and the network are encrypted. Even if GCHQ or the NSA were to intercept the phone signals as they are transmitted through the air, the intercepted data would be a garbled mess. Decrypting it can be challenging and time-consuming. Stealing the keys, on the other hand, is beautifully simple, from the intelligence agenciesâ point of view, as the pipeline for producing and distributing SIM cards was never designed to thwart mass surveillance efforts.  One of the creators of the encryption protocol that is widely used today for securing emails, Adi Shamir, famously asserted: âCryptography is typically bypassed, not penetrated.â In other words, it is much easier (and sneakier) to open a locked door when you have the key than it is to break down the door using brute force. While the NSA and GCHQ have substantial resources dedicated to breaking encryption, it is not the only way â and certainly not always the most efficient â to get at the data they want. âNSA has more mathematicians on its payroll than any other entity in the U.S.,â says the ACLUâs Soghoian. âBut the NSAâs hackers are way busier than its mathematicians.â  GCHQ and the NSA could have taken any number of routes to steal SIM encryption keys and other data. They could have physically broken into a manufacturing plant. They could have broken into a wireless carrierâs office. They could have bribed, blackmailed or coerced an employee of the manufacturer or cellphone provider. But all of that comes with substantial risk of exposure. In the case of Gemalto, hackers working for GCHQ remotely penetrated the companyâs computer network in order to steal the keys in bulk as they were en route to the wireless network providers.  SIM card âpersonalizationâ companies like Gemalto ship hundreds of thousands of SIM cards at a time to mobile phone operators across the world. International shipping records obtained by The Intercept show that in 2011, Gemalto shipped 450,000 smart cards from its plant in Mexico to Germanyâs Deutsche Telekom in just one shipment.  In order for the cards to work and for the phonesâ communications to be secure, Gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new SIM cards. These master key files could be shipped via FedEx, DHL, UPS or another snail mail provider. More commonly, they could be sent via email or through File Transfer Protocol, FTP, a method of sending files over the Internet.  The moment the master key set is generated by Gemalto or another personalization company, but before it is sent to the wireless carrier, is the most vulnerable moment for interception. âThe value of getting them at the point of manufacture is you can presumably get a lot of keys in one go, since SIM chips get made in big batches,â says Green, the cryptographer. âSIM cards get made for lots of different carriers in one facility.â In Gemaltoâs case, GCHQ hit the jackpot, as the company manufactures SIMs for hundreds of wireless network providers, including all of the leading U.S.â and many of the largest European â companies.  But obtaining the encryption keys while Gemalto still held them required finding a way into the companyâs internal systems.  [Slide -- see original article for details]  TOP-SECRET GCHQ documents reveal that the intelligence agencies accessed the email and Facebook accounts of engineers and other employees of major telecom corporations and SIM card manufacturers in an effort to secretly obtain information that could give them access to millions of encryption keys. They did this by utilizing the NSAâs X-KEYSCORE program, which allowed them access to private emails hosted by the SIM card and mobile companiesâ servers, as well as those of major tech corporations, including Yahoo and Google.  In effect, GCHQ clandestinely cyberstalked Gemalto employees, scouring their emails in an effort to find people who may have had access to the companyâs core networks and Ki-generating systems. The intelligence agencyâs goal was to find information that would aid in breaching Gemaltoâs systems, making it possible to steal large quantities of encryption keys. The agency hoped to intercept the files containing the keys as they were transmitted between Gemalto and its wireless network provider customers.  GCHQ operatives identified key individuals and their positions within Gemalto and then dug into their emails. In one instance, GCHQ zeroed in on a Gemalto employee in Thailand who they observed sending PGP-encrypted files, noting that if GCHQ wanted to expand its Gemalto operations, âhe would certainly be a good place to start.â They did not claim to have decrypted the employeeâs communications, but noted that the use of PGP could mean the contents were potentially valuable.  The cyberstalking was not limited to Gemalto. GCHQ operatives wrote a script that allowed the agency to mine the private communications of employees of major telecommunications and SIM âpersonalizationâ companies for technical terms used in the assigning of secret keys to mobile phone customers. Employees for the SIM card manufacturers and wireless network providers were labeled as âknown individuals and operators targetedâ in a top-secret GCHQ document.  According to that April 2010 document, âPCS Harvesting at Scale,â hackers working for GCHQ focused on âharvestingâ massive amounts of individual encryption keys âin transit between mobile network operators and SIM card personalisation centresâ like Gemalto. The spies âdeveloped a methodology for intercepting these keys as they are transferred between various network operators and SIM card providers.â By that time, GCHQ had developed âan automated technique with the aim of increasing the volume of keys that can be harvested.â  The PCS Harvesting document acknowledged that, in searching for information on encryption keys, GCHQ operatives would undoubtedly vacuum up âa large number of unrelated itemsâ from the private communications of targeted employees. â[H]owever an analyst with good knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of large batches of [keys].â  The document noted that many SIM card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers âby email or FTP with simple encryption methods that can be broken â¦ or occasionally with no encryption at all.â To get bulk access to encryption keys, all the NSA or GCHQ needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the Internet â something both agencies already do millions of times per day. A footnote in the 2010 document observed that the use of âstrong encryption products â¦ is becoming increasingly commonâ in transferring the keys.  In its key harvesting âtrialâ operations in the first quarter of 2010, GCHQ successfully intercepted keys used by wireless network providers in Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Serbia, Iceland and Tajikistan. But, the agency noted, its automated key harvesting system failed to produce results against Pakistani networks, denoted as âpriority targetsâ in the document, despite the fact that GCHQ had a store of Kis from two providers in the country, Mobilink and Telenor. â t is possible that these networks now use more secure methods to transfer Kis,â the document concluded.  From December 2009 through March 2010, a month before the Mobile Handset Exploitation Team was formed, GCHQ conducted a number of trials aimed at extracting encryption keys and other personalized data for individual phones. In one two-week period, they accessed the emails of 130 people associated with wireless network providers or SIM card manufacturing and personalization. This operation produced nearly 8,000 keys matched to specific phones in 10 countries. In another two-week period, by mining just six email addresses, they produced 85,000 keys. At one point in March 2010, GCHQ intercepted nearly 100,000 keys for mobile phone users in Somalia. By June, theyâd compiled 300,000. âSomali providers are not on GCHQâs list of interest,â the document noted. â[H]owever, this was usefully shared with NSA.â  The GCHQ documents only contain statistics for three months of encryption key theft in 2010. During this period, millions of keys were harvested. The documents stated explicitly that GCHQ had already created a constantly evolving automated process for bulk harvesting of keys. They describe active operations targeting Gemaltoâs personalization centers across the globe, as well as other major SIM card manufacturers and the private communications of their employees.  A top-secret NSA document asserted that, as of 2009, the U.S. spy agency already had the capacity to process between 12 and 22 million keys per second for later use against surveillance targets. In the future, the agency predicted, it would be capable of processing more than 50 million per second. The document did not state how many keys were actually processed, just that the NSA had the technology to perform such swift, bulk operations. It is impossible to know how many keys have been stolen by the NSA and GCHQ to date, but, even using conservative math, the numbers are likely staggering.  GCHQ assigned âscoresâ to more than 150 individual email addresses based on how often the users mentioned certain technical terms, and then intensified the mining of those individualsâ accounts based on priority. The highest-scoring email address was that of an employee of Chinese tech giant Huawei, which the U.S. has repeatedly accused of collaborating with Chinese intelligence. In all, GCHQ harvested the emails of employees of hardware companies that manufacture phones, such as Ericsson and Nokia; operators of mobile networks, such as MTN Irancell and Belgacom; SIM card providers, such as Bluefish and Gemalto; and employees of targeted companies who used email providers, such as Yahoo and Google. During the three-month trial, the largest number of email addresses harvested were those belonging to Huawei employees, followed by MTN Irancell. The third largest class of emails harvested in the trial were private Gmail accounts, presumably belonging to employees at targeted companies.  âPEOPLE WERE SPECIFICALLY HUNTED AND TARGETED BY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, NOT BECAUSE THEY DID ANYTHING WRONG, BUT BECAUSE THEY COULD BE USED.â The GCHQ program targeting Gemalto was called DAPINO GAMMA. In 2011, GCHQ launched operation HIGHLAND FLING to mine the email accounts of Gemalto employees in France and Poland. A top-secret document on the operation stated that one of the aims was âgetting into French HQâ of Gemalto âto get in to core data repositories.â France, home to one of Gemaltoâs global headquarters, is the nerve center of the companyâs worldwide operations. Another goal was to intercept private communications of employees in Poland that âcould lead to penetration into one or more personalisation centersâ â the factories where the encryption keys are burned onto SIM cards.  As part of these operations, GCHQ operatives acquired the usernames and passwords for Facebook accounts of Gemalto targets. An internal top-secret GCHQ wiki on the program from May 2011 indicated that GCHQ was in the process of âtargetingâ more than a dozen Gemalto facilities across the globe, including in Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Singapore.  The document also stated that GCHQ was preparing similar key theft operations against one of Gemaltoâs competitors, Germany-based SIM card giant Giesecke and Devrient.  On January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama gave a major address on the NSA spying scandal. âThe bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who donât threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures,â he said.  The monitoring of the lawful communications of employees of major international corporations shows that such statements by Obama, other U.S. officials and British leaders â that they only intercept and monitor the communications of known or suspected criminals or terrorists â were untrue. âThe NSA and GCHQ view the private communications of people who work for these companies as fair game,â says the ACLUâs Soghoian. âThese people were specifically hunted and targeted by intelligence agencies, not because they did anything wrong, but because they could be used as a means to an end.â  [Slide -- see original article for details]   THERE ARE TWO basic types of electronic or digital surveillance: passive and active. All intelligence agencies engage in extensive passive surveillance, which means they collect bulk data by intercepting communications sent over fiber-optic cables, radio waves or wireless devices.  Intelligence agencies place high-power antennas, known as âspy nests,â on the top of their countriesâ embassies and consulates, which are capable of vacuuming up data sent to or from mobile phones in the surrounding area. The joint NSA/CIA Special Collection Service is the lead entity that installs and mans these nests for the United States. An embassy situated near a parliament or government agency could easily intercept the phone calls and data transfers of the mobile phones used by foreign government officials. The U.S. embassy in Berlin, for instance, is located a stoneâs throw from the Bundestag. But if the wireless carriers are using stronger encryption, which is built into modern 3G, 4G and LTE networks, then intercepted calls and other data would be more difficult to crack, particularly in bulk. If the intelligence agency wants to actually listen to or read what is being transmitted, they would need to decrypt the encrypted data.  Active surveillance is another option. This would require government agencies to âjamâ a 3G or 4G network, forcing nearby phones onto 2G. Once forced down to the less secure 2G technology, the phone can be tricked into connecting to a fake cell tower operated by an intelligence agency. This method of surveillance, though effective, is risky, as it leaves a digital trace that counter-surveillance experts from foreign governments could detect.  Stealing the Kis solves all of these problems. This way, intelligence agencies can safely engage in passive, bulk surveillance without having to decrypt data and without leaving any trace whatsoever.  âKey theft enables the bulk, low-risk surveillance of encrypted communications,â the ACLUâs Soghoian says. âAgencies can collect all the communications and then look through them later. With the keys, they can decrypt whatever they want, whenever they want. Itâs like a time machine, enabling the surveillance of communications that occurred before someone was even a target.â  Neither the NSA nor GCHQ would comment specifically on the key theft operations. In the past, they have argued more broadly that breaking encryption is a necessary part of tracking terrorists and other criminals. âIt is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters,â a GCHQ official stated in an email, adding that the agencyâs work is conducted within a âstrict legal and policy frameworkâ that ensures its activities are âauthorized, necessary and proportionate,â with proper oversight, which is the standard response the agency has provided for previous stories published by The Intercept. The agency also said, â[T]he UKâs interception regime is entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.â The NSA declined to offer any comment.  It is unlikely that GCHQâs pronouncement about the legality of its operations will be universally embraced in Europe. âIt is governments massively engaging in illegal activities,â says Sophie inât Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. âIf you are not a government and you are a student doing this, you will end up in jail for 30 years.â Veld, who chaired the European Parliamentâs recent inquiry into mass surveillance exposed by Snowden, told The Intercept: âThe secret services are just behaving like cowboys. Governments are behaving like cowboys and nobody is holding them to account.â  The Interceptâs Laura Poitras has previously reported that in 2013 Australiaâs signals intelligence agency, a close partner of the NSA, stole some 1.8 million encryption keys from an Indonesian wireless carrier.  A few years ago, the FBI reportedly dismantled several transmitters set up by foreign intelligence agencies around the Washington, D.C. area, which could be used to intercept cellphone communications. Russia, China, Israel and other nations use similar technology as the NSA across the world. If those governments had the encryption keys for major U.S. cellphone companiesâ customers, such as those manufactured by Gemalto, mass snooping would be simple. âIt would mean that with a few antennas placed around Washington, D.C., the Chinese or Russian governments could sweep up and decrypt the communications of members of Congress, U.S. agency heads, reporters, lobbyists and everyone else involved in the policymaking process and decrypt their telephone conversations,â says Soghoian.  âPut a device in front of the U.N., record every bit you see going over the air. Steal some keys, you have all those conversations,â says Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer. And itâs not just spy agencies that would benefit from stealing encryption keys. âI can only imagine how much money you could make if you had access to the calls made around Wall Street,â he adds.  [Slide -- see original article for details]  THE BREACH OF Gemaltoâs computer network by GCHQ has far-reaching global implications. The company, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in 2013, is a global leader in digital security, producing banking cards, mobile payment systems, two-factor authentication devices used for online security, hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices, electronic passports and identification cards. It provides chips to Vodafone in Europe and Franceâs Orange, as well as EE, a joint venture in the U.K. between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. Royal KPN, the largest Dutch wireless network provider, also uses Gemalto technology.  In Asia, Gemaltoâs chips are used by China Unicom, Japanâs NTT and Taiwanâs Chungwa Telecom, as well as scores of wireless network providers throughout Africa and the Middle East. The companyâs security technology is used by more than 3,000 financial institutions and 80 government organizations. Among its clients are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JP Morgan Chase and Barclays. It also provides chips for use in luxury cars, including those made by Audi and BMW.  In 2012, Gemalto won a sizable contract, worth $175 million, from the U.S. government to produce the covers for electronic U.S. passports, which contain chips and antennas that can be used to better authenticate travelers. As part of its contract, Gemalto provides the personalization and software for the microchips implanted in the passports. The U.S. represents Gemaltoâs single largest market, accounting for some 15 percent of its total business. This raises the question of whether GCHQ, which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks, has the ability to access private data protected by other Gemalto products created for banks and governments.  As smart phones become smarter, they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services. When Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile formed an alliance in 2010 to jointly build an electronic pay system to challenge Google Wallet and Apple Pay, they purchased Gemaltoâs technology for their program, known as Softcard. (Until July 2014, it previously went by the unfortunate name of âISIS Mobile Wallet.â) Whether data relating to that, and other Gemalto security products, has been compromised by GCHQ and the NSA is unclear. Both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story.  [Slide -- see original article for details]  PRIVACY ADVOCATES and security experts say it would take billions of dollars, significant political pressure, and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that NSA, GCHQ and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit.  A current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of Perfect Forward Security (PFS), a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys. PFS, which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like Google and Twitter, works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message, which are then discarded. Rather than using the same encryption key to protect yearsâ worth of data, as the permanent Kis on SIM cards can, a new key might be generated each minute, hour or day, and then promptly destroyed. Because cellphone communications do not utilize PFS, if an intelligence agency has been âpassivelyâ intercepting someoneâs communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key, it can go back and decrypt all of those communications. If mobile phone networks were using PFS, that would not be possible â even if the permanent keys were later stolen.  The only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from Ki theft-enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software, rather than relying on SIM card-based security. Secure software includes email and other apps that use Transport Layer Security (TLS), the mechanism underlying the secure HTTPS web protocol. The email clients included with Android phones and iPhones support TLS, as do large email providers like Yahoo and Google.  Apps like TextSecure and Silent Text are secure alternatives to SMS messages, while Signal, RedPhone and Silent Phone encrypt voice communications. Governments still may be able to intercept communications, but reading or listening to them would require hacking a specific handset, obtaining internal data from an email provider, or installing a bug in a room to record the conversations.  âWe need to stop assuming that the phone companies will provide us with a secure method of making calls or exchanging text messages,â says Soghoian. âââ  Documents published with this article:  CNE Access to Core Mobile Networks - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/cne-access-core-mobile-networks-2/  Where Are These Keys? - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/keys/  CCNE Successes Jan10-Mar10 Trial - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-successes-jan10-mar10-trial/  DAPINO GAMMA CNE Presence Wiki - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-cne-presence-wiki/  DAPINO GAMMA Gemalto Yuaawaa Wiki - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-gemalto-yuaawaa-wiki/  DAPINO GAMMA Target Personalisation Centres Gemalto Wiki - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-target-personalisation-centres-gemalto-wiki/  IMSIs Identified with Ki Data for Network Providers Jan10-Mar10 Trial - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/imsis-identified-ki-data-network-providers-jan10-mar10-trial/  CCNE Stats Summaries Jan10-Mar10 Trial - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-stats-summaries-jan10-mar10-trial/  CCNE Email Harvesting Jan10-Mar10 Trial - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-email-harvesting-jan10-mar10-trial/  CCNE Email Addresses Jan10-Mar10 Trial - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-email-addresses-jan10-mar10-trial/   PCS Harvesting at Scale - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/pcs-harvesting-scale/  âââ Additional reporting by Andrew Fishman and Ryan Gallagher.

They could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. This opens you up to obvious scams. Don't fall for what he is proposing. Verify the address and protect yourself from scams.  Also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. Also in the situation Jolly Roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. Funds released, market bypassed. The market is not protected in 2/3.  The market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. This would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. If the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. But to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. It's not healthy.   I would warn anyone away from the setup Jolly Roger is promoting. Will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.","Quote from: fromage on February 24, 2014, 06:32:27 pmWell if it's all about trust in the end, is there any point to multisig addresses?Yes, it is to stop the market from getting robbed because each transaction needs to be unlocked separately with unique keys. I suppose you could get the public keys from the seller and server but this effectively would give the buyer and seller the ability to close the deal without the server and therefore you could cut out their market fees. So this is a bad idea for the server to do this. Let me just say, that there is no more risk to doing multisig than regular escrow, and in fact less risk because a 3rd party hacker cannot steal everyone's money. Trusting the market is a choice you need to make on your own and if you want to deal directly with the vendor, then do so outside of the market.If the market is going to give its customers the ability to close deals while cutting out their market fees, it would not be worth it for the market."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","1214.0","2014-02-25T17:57:28","Question about multisig","General Discussion/Security"," Excuse me. First of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. Accusing me that I am trying to get you all to ""fall for something"". And I do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making.   #1) How is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? The markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. People were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? Where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?   #2) Yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. In a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. With 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. This is why 2/3 is better than 2/2.   Also in the case of 2/3, the market  cannot be bypassed without the  redeemScript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. If the market holds the redeemScript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the market's fees.   Another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.   #3) It is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. Unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees.    So what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market.   The market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of it's own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. If the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets.   But giving out the 3 keys and the redeemScript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. Again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. But with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. Especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.   ronin, I understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. But it is NOT desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market RELIES on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business.   There are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. If you are not comfortable using the market's system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. But if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. I do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. The cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not ""pay their taxes"" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market.   Again, I reiterate. If you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. You make the choice. ","I have to disagree with this guy1) If the server doesn't give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it.

This way, BlackBank is more than happy to allow vendors/buyers to finalize outside of BlackBank.  The only trust issue would be if BlackBank offers support if there are problems.  However, that is a lot less risky than traditional centralized escrow systems and easier for the buyer/vendor.  I'm sure buyer/vendor would prioritize verifying that the funds/transactions over verifying support.  However, I still promise to continue support with any issues; I've been offering advice and support outside of BlackBank entirely, even to members of other markets.  It's important to help each other in the community.  Growing a safe and secure community is mutually beneficial for everyone, regardless of immediate financial gain.

You are proposing a multi sig escrow solution which doesn't protect the buyer from rogue markets or incompetent developers. Kind of poinltess in my opionion.  Regarding risk compared to previous, its the same, market could go rogue or loose all its coins due to incompetent devs. Whats your point? You are proposing a solution that still exposes users to the same problems. And its not a sudden worry. I have raised the issue of mutli sig way before the SR2 debacle. Take the time to go through my postings on this forum and others and you will see I have been a long term proponent of multi sig. Way beforfe it became 'fashinable'.   It doesn't benefit the scammer financially to pull a scam. Which removes most of the motive. I agree 2/3 is better, but not if the market doesn't allow the buyer/vendor to confirm the address (as you are proposing). I wouldn't touch a market that insists on hiding the details of the address from you. Its too open to abuse/incompetence.  Agreed re: the redeem script. But the market cant really withold the script if someone can generate it themselves from the original inputs.  I don't think its a security issue if the buyer/vendor can see the market is reusing the same keys. This would be an excellent way of people being able to ascertain if the market is coded by an incompetent.    I don't see the issue here. What is difficult about this exactly? Anyone running the bitcond client is always getting every transaction. The databse holding transactions could be checked for transactions once a week that are older than one month. Any such transaction which has the funds removed from the address would be flagged as having done a deal outside the market. Account banned. I could probably write a bash script to do this fairly quickly. Am i missing something here? What is the difficulty?    I think it has already been shown that markets suffer from fraudulent owners or incompetent developers. I am not saying markets shouldn't charge a fee. But I am also not proposing a solution that offers no benefits unless you abolutely trust the markets honesty and development abiity, which recent events have shown aren't a good bet.  I think this benefits everyone involved. While I hear what you are saying about maintaining the dominance of markets and that users should trust them with multi sig, I respectfully disagree, I think its an appalling setup, and will only lead to more scams and hacks. It sovles nothing and doesn't move us towards a trustless system.","Quote from: ronin on February 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmI have to disagree with this guy1) If the server doesn't give you the opportunity to verify the address then its not worth it. They could give you a multi sig that is 2/2 with addresses both controlled by the market. This opens you up to obvious scams. Don't fall for what he is proposing. Verify the address and protect yourself from scams.Excuse me. First of all, your accusations about me are very offensive. Accusing me that I am trying to get you all to ""fall for something"". And I do not think you completely understand the entire process of multisignature addresses to make the claims you are making. #1) How is this any more risky than the escrow system that markets had before? The markets were controlling the funds 100% and getting robbed and cleaned out on several occasions. People were placing trust in markets before and now suddenly you are worried about getting scammed? Where were you speaking out with the old escrow system?;Quote from: ronin on February 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm2) Also it makes no sense for the market to hide this, if the buyer/seller wanted to avoid fees they could set up their own 2/2 escrow. Also in the situation Jolly Roger describes above the buyer could sign a transaction sending all funds to vendor, and then vendor verifies and also signs the transaction. Funds released, market bypassed. The market is not protected in 2/3.#2) Yes, they (buyer and seller) could set up their own 2/2 escrow outside the market, but this would be stupid because having a 2/3 makes it possible for the market to become the arbitrator. In a 2/2, only one of the people involved has to be a scammer, and then the funds are locked forever. With 2/3, if the buyer tries to scam, then the market can provide the second key to unlock the funds to send to the seller. This is why 2/3 is better than 2/2. Also in the case of 2/3, the market cannot be bypassed without the redeemScript generated at the time that the multisignature address is created. If the market holds the redeemScript in a 2/3 multisignature address, then the buyer and seller cannot complete the transaction on the side without the market and therefore cut out the market's fees. Another security issue with releasing all 3 public keys involved is that it lets the participants know whether or not the seller, buyer, or server are reusing a private key and therefore making them more susceptible to attacks.;Quote from: ronin on February 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pm3) The market would rely on getting income through signing a transaction which sends most funds to vendor, and commision to market. This would then be signed by the buyer when he is happy. If the buyer starts bypassing the market fee transaction then he is banned. But to hide it all away from the user and not give them the ability to be able to verify addresses, avoid this market set up. It's not healthy. #3) It is harder to verify you might think to see if the buyer and seller are closing the deal on the side. Unless the market is constantly searching through the blockchain for funds spent from that multisignature address, it would be extremely difficult to verify that a buyer and seller are bypassing the market to cut out their fees. ;Quote from: ronin on February 25, 2014, 02:29:28 pmI would warn anyone away from the setup Jolly Roger is promoting. Will lead to more scams in the future, and it will not allow you to verify multi sig is setup correctly.So what you are basically saying here is that the market should trust the buyers, but the buyers should not trust the market. The market has every incentive to keep the ability to unlock funds itself out of it's own hands, so that it is not a target for hackers. If the market has the ability to unlock the funds without any buyer or seller input, it would make the market very dangerous and this is not desirable and defeats the purpose of it for the markets. But giving out the 3 keys and the redeemScript to the buyer and seller gives them the ability to close the deal outside the market and bypass fees. Again, if you are not able to trust your market, then yes, contact the seller and say you want to do a 2/2 with your seller outside of the market, and you can easily set one up. But with fees at an average of 5%, bypassing the fees will become more common than you think and is harder to detect than you think. Especially when you are dealing with thousands of transactions.ronin, I understand what you are saying and you make a valid point that it would likely be desirable for a buyer to have this setup. But it is NOT desireable for a market to have this setup, since the market RELIES on market fees and by giving your customers the ability to cut you out of the deal is bad for business. There are plenty of free 2/2 and 2/3 multisignature services out there now that you can use. If you are not comfortable using the market's system, then use another one that gives you the 3 public keys. But if you expect the markets to start giving you the ability to bypass their commissions, then you will likely never be happy. I do not think it makes sense for markets to do this. The cost of running a market is high and by allowing your buyers to not ""pay their taxes"" so to speak, is a dumb move for the market. Again, I reiterate. If you do not trust your market, do a 2/2 or a 2/3 outside of the market. You make the choice."

Prosecutors are seeking more than 20 years in prison for Ross William Ulbricht, found guilty by a jury of running Silk Road while using the online name âDread Pirate Roberts,â when he appears before a Manhattan judge Friday.Lawyers for both the government and Slomp extolled his cooperation with a U.S. probe of the illicit emporium. Prosecutors asked for a 15-year sentence while defense attorney Paul Petruzzi sought a term of just under six years. Federal guidelines called for a prison term of as long as 40 years.Outside court, Petruzzi called his clientâs punishment âa damn good result, if you ask me.âSilk Road was described by federal prosecutors in New York as a âsprawling black-market bazaarâ used to anonymously sell illicit goods and launder money. The Silk Road website was shut in 2013.Source: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-28/silk-road-s-biggest-drug-dealer-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prisonThanks.Are there any trial transcripts available?"

The vulnerability is limited to supporting browsers such as Firefox and Chrome, and appears to affect Windows users only. Luckily the security hole is relatively easy to fix.  The Snowden revelations have made it clear that online privacy is certainly not a given.  Just a few days ago we learned that the Canadian Government tracked visitors of dozens of popular file-sharing sites.  As these stories make headlines around the world interest in anonymity services such as VPNs has increased, as even regular Internet users donât like the idea of being spied on.  Unfortunately, even the best VPN services canât guarantee to be 100% secure. This week a very concerning security flaw revealed that itâs easy to see the real IP-addresses of many VPN users through a WebRTC feature.  With a few lines of code websites can make requests to STUN servers and log usersâ VPN IP-address and the âhiddenâ home IP-address, as well as local network addresses.  The vulnerability affects WebRTC-supporting browsers including Firefox and Chrome and appears to be limited to Windows machines.  A demo published on GitHub by developer Daniel Roesler allows people to check if they are affected by the security flaw.  The demo claims that browser plugins canât block the vulnerability, but luckily this isnât entirely true. There are several easy fixes available to patch the security hole.  Chrome users can install the WebRTC block extension or ScriptSafe, which both reportedly block the vulnerability.  Firefox users should be able to block the request with the NoScript addon. Alternatively, they can type âabout:configâ in the address bar and set the âmedia.peerconnection.enabledâ setting to false.  TF asked various VPN providers to share their thoughts and tips on the vulnerability. Private Internet Access told us that the are currently investigating the issue to see what they can do on their end to address it. (Update: PIA published an article on the issue today)  TorGuard informed us that they issued a warning in a blog post along with instructions on how to stop the browser leak. Ben Van Der Pelt, TorGuardâs CEO, further informed us that tunneling the VPN through a router is another fix.  âPerhaps the best way to be protected from WebRTC and similar vulnerabilities is to run the VPN tunnel directly on the router. This allows the user to be connected to a VPN directly via Wi-Fi, leaving no possibility of a rogue script bypassing a software VPN tunnel and finding oneâs real IP,â Van der Pelt says.  âDuring our testing Windows users who were connected by way of a VPN router were not vulnerable to WebRTC IP leaks even without any browser fixes,â he adds.  While the fixes above are all reported to work, the leak is a reminder that anonymity should never be taken for granted.  As is often the case with these type of vulnerabilities, VPN and proxy users should regularly check if their connection is secure. This also includes testing against DNS leaks and proxy vulnerabilities.  Update: Freebsd also appears to be affected by the vulnerability.  Update: Other OSes and browsers may also be affected, please test your connection to be sure. Tagged in: vpn  Zaphod ",""

The detailed information about this security hole can be found in Github website here: https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips  Here is what Github claim about this security hole:  âFirefox and Chrome have implemented WebRTC that allow requests to STUN servers be made that will return the local and public IP addresses for the user. These request results are available to javascript, so you can now obtain a users local and public IP addresses in javascript. This demo is an example implementation of that. Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery. This makes these types of requests available for online tracking if an advertiser sets up a STUN server with a wildcard domain.â  In short, the IP check method that is used by Firefox and Chrome browsers allows websites to reveal the real ISP issued IP address. It is claimed that websites can determine the actual IP address by running a WebRTC JavaScript code within the web browser without the visitor knowing about it. However, this security hole was only detected in Windows Firefox and Chrome browsers and no IP leaks were discovered for Android, Linux and Mac OS versions.  Since this security hole can affect many VPN users, we strongly recommend to read the following information, explaining how to overcome this issue by taking few simple steps:  Chrome for Windows. If you use Chrome browser for Windows, we recommend you to install the free browser extension, which you can find here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-block/nphkkbaidamjmhfanlpblblcadhfbkdm?hl=en  After you install the extension, it is recommended to test if WebRTC was disabled. In order to do that, you should visit Browserleaks website and check if the WebRTC is enabled or disabled.  Firefox for Windows. In case of disabling WebRTC in Firefox for Windows, you should make few more steps. At first you will need to type âabout:configâ into the URL bar and press enter. Then look for âmedia.peerconnection.enabledâ and double click to set it to ""false"".  ////////////////////////////////////////////////  Here you can test if your real IP could be leaked or not (this is scary): https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/",""

""Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.""   -- Napoleon   I couldn't disagree with you more. Evangelical Christianity is on the rise, even in formerly majority Catholic regions like South America. People are abandoning the Catholic church, and are embracing fundamentalist Protestantism, with all its right-wing political and social baggage.     Capitalism,  properly restrained and controlled, is not a bad thing. Untrammelled capitalism is a scourge. We're now entering a second Gilded Age, and like the first Gilded Age, about 100 years ago, eventually the 1% will push it too far, and then the majority of people will begin to fight back.  At the most recent Davos conference, even one of the wealthy attendees was going on about inequality, saying, ""They're going to come after us with pitchforks!""  History has shown, that when people mobilize in their millions, even the most hardened tyrants must fall -- in just the last 10 years, we've seen it in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere. As a general rule, armies will not fire on their own people -- this was the case in pre-revolutionary Russia, when the Czar's troops joined with the people. Even in China, in 1989, with the Tianamen Square uprising, Beijing had to bring in troops from a remote region of China, from a different ethnic group, who spoke a different language, because Beijing greatly feared that the regular troops would not fire on other Han Chinese.

The weird thing about religion is how the denominations don't see how much they pick and choose.  I've never met two Christians who believed the same thing, and there isn't a Christian who can follow the Bible completely since it contradicts itself, says you should be killed for wearing two different types of cloth, and stoning isn't exactly an ""in"" thing in the west.  Also to believe in hell you have to be fucking evil.  NOBODY could EVER deserve burning and reburning forever, and a lot of christians think that should happen to you because you don't believe in their version of ""God"".  Those people are just straight evil, I mean think about it, an eternal punishment meant to be of optimum pain doesn't fit for anything, wtf.

My impression is/was this site isn't a honeypot... rather, it's a gathering place for LEA to swap information. Very much like an LEA version of The Hub, except with restricted access.    For the most part, anyone with two working brain cells assumed that sites like Silk Road were crawling with LEA, once they discovered its existence. The Gawker article brought in lots of newbies to SR, and doubtless some of them were LEA investigators.    It's  never been true, ever.     I second that.    Fuck Reddit. The best sources are court filings/documents, if you can get your hands on them. Luckily, they're more available now than they were years ago.    Ross Ulbricht / Curtis Green and the 'kilo' of coke are a case in point. Greed will fuck you over every time.    Defendants, all too often, condemn themselves out of their own mouths.    If you're a high-flying broker, you shouldn't be (and don't need to be) selling dope -- that's just stupid.    Likely so.    If you said bad security advice, I'd agree with you.

Hey bro, whilst this sounds like a great idea in theory it could really backfire spectacularly. ;As you know, it is a crime to impersonate a police officer, a federal officer or employee, or any other public shithead LE type person. You've posted on here that you've tried and admitted you do various things you shouldn't prolly admit here because maybe they'll read that and be able to connect the person who made the attempts to sign in to their forums to your RL identity? Heck it could even be a honeypot just for that exact reason. ;Just be careful as fuck - LE are crawling all over the darknet forums and reddit right now, they always have been but now more than ever. Ever since we found out that SR2 was being run by LE, we have started to get a very real and clear picture that they are here and they are posting. ;We are never safe and no dnm community is as warm, fluffy and welcoming as we'd like to think. Forget what Chemcat used to spout about us being a family and all that lovely stuff that sounds great in theory, it just aint true now. ;Buried amongst the sheep and hilariously funny lunatics in this family are a couple of very ravenous wolves in sheep's clothing (or more accurately LE in druggy clothing). So be careful when you make posts like this on a whim.That aside, I think the best bet for gaining info on police tactics is read, read, read. Not on some special LE forum, forget that.  ;There's a lot of posts on reddit and other forums on the clearnet made by people who've been busted for drugs and lived to tell the tale. LE have certain protocol and rules they have to follow, so many cases and arrests go down in the sameish way or in a similar way. Just search and read up and continually sharpen up your personal security. Read about local busts in your local paper to see how it went down. You get the picture. But avoid anyone who has been busted, they could be looking to get a lighter sentence in return for co-operating with LE.  ;Obviously never sell to anyone you don't know. It sounds obvious but many a drug dealer has been caught by an undercover with a pile of cash saying that they're wanting to make a big buy. ;Watch documentaries about RL drug cases. You can never know or learn too much.The main thing to remember is if ever the worst happens and you are arrested, don't get spooked and not think straight and freak out and start confessing everything. They will lie and tell you they have incriminating things that they don't have in an attempt to get you to confess. Calmly ask for a lawyer and remain silent until you get that lawyer no matter how long it takes (it can take as long as 2 days I read the other day) because you keeping silent and not talking to anyone keeps their defense options open. ;There are public defenders in America whose job is to protect and defend. Make use of one of these should you get caught.Unless you have a career and a way to prove you have a legit income then use one of these public defenders. After they read you your rights then ask for a lawyer and remain silent until the lawyer arrives. If you're say, a high flying broker with piles of money that you can prove you earned legally then keep a decent attorney on a retainer as an insurance policy against arrest and winning your liberty. ;I think that remembering to keep silent upon arrest, and good opsec, would get you far further than trying to pose as LE on a LE forum in the same way they pose as drug users on drug forums. I honestly doubt they'd say anything about tactics we don't know already. ;We all know that they come to the forums on the dnms and try to become (or do become) valued and respected community members. They'll often be the ones dishing out security advice, because they're so wonderful and helpful they couldn't possibly be LE, right? Perhaps they'll be the one who's always there, who's always or often online making jokes peppered with bits of advice here and there. Just as rapists don't walk around in t-shirts with ""I am a rapist"" on them and are charming until they get their claws into their victim, undercover officers tend to do all that they can to appear legit. ;The FBI is actively recruiting people with degrees in all kind of computer, deepweb, PGP, BTC and crypto- type specialists. The deepweb is developing real fast and most of the time they're catching people using old-fashioned police work, but in an ideal world they want to be several steps ahead of DNM operators and their dev teams. They got Ross from a security fail he made using his real email and they got Blake through a security fail of hiring several undercover officers as mods and admins, plus him using his real email to rent the SR2 servers. Well, the jury's out they may well have straight up just used NSA help. ;But whatever, my point is read up as much as you can to protect your best asset - your life and your freedom. Their biggest weapon is human stupidity, exploiting peoples' trusting natures and social engineering.  ;Look at how Ross Ulbricht was yapping away to an undercover agent in the sr1 irc chatroom at the time he was busted. That helped them know he was logged on so they could get him with his laptop open. Also in the indictment an UC asked casually in irc something like ""does your girlfriend know about you being Dread?"" and he replied, ""No, no way"" or something - all these seemingly little slips can add up to proof that you're a certain person doing a certain thing when they're building a case. They rely on people maybe being high, lonely and chatty. ;So keep your mouth shut and your eyes open and always trust your instincts - don't ever write something off as paranoia. Better to be paranoid and free than locked up in a federal open all hours 24/7 motel.  ;Forget this other idea and maybe edit out the details of what you tried to access and when in your original post or better yet maybe delete it. ;I do like the idea of you compiling a tactics sheet, but your time would probably be better spent right now focusing on you and your situation, cause no offence but it sounds to me like you need to brush up on your OPSEC and you might have been stoned when you thought up this idea without thinking it through properly with all the possible consequences. ;Peace out.  :)"

On www.deepdotweb.com they post the affadavits of marketplace busts. I have found these very useful. The overarching rule seems to be that right from the very beginning, you need to establish a protocol for conducting yourself online. Decide what you're hoping to hide, and from whom, and fashion a protocol around this. Thereafter, never deviate from protocol. If you read the details of criminal complaints, you'll be shocked at how many get busted from being plain sloppy.

I should qualify my statement: cheap burner phone bought with cash, SIM and credit bought with cash or anonymous debit card. Mind you, trying to deceive them with a voicemail message doesn't really appeal to me and isn't really the strategy I would use. Instead, if I were going to do this, I would attempt to obtain officer records with badge number (e.g. Cop Block), along with a sworn affadavit by the cop from a criminal complaint found online. In the opening paragraphs, the officer will state their current position in detail. I was able to find a cop's badge number, and all the details of their position, but not for the same officer. This is the tricky bit. I have a feeling that the ideal candidate would be a crooked cop that's been outed on Cop Block, followed by the criminal complain made against them.I would further add: By disclosing your intentions publically, you've burned this plan by a good few months. I would say LE has been reading this thread and already given them a heads up. Lay low and in 6 or so months, revisit this. "

Ever since we found out that SR2 was being run by LE, we have started to get a very real and clear picture that they are here and they are posting.  We are never safe and no dnm community is as warm, fluffy and welcoming as we'd like to think.   Forget what Chemcat used to spout about us being a family and all that lovely stuff that sounds great in theory, it just aint true now.   Buried amongst the sheep and hilariously funny lunatics in this family are a couple of very ravenous wolves in sheep's clothing (or more accurately LE in druggy clothing). So be careful when you make posts like this on a whim.  That aside, I think the best bet for gaining info on police tactics is read, read, read. Not on some special LE forum, forget that.   There's a lot of posts on reddit and other forums on the clearnet made by people who've been busted for drugs and lived to tell the tale. LE have certain protocol and rules they have to follow, so many cases and arrests go down in the sameish way or in a similar way. Just search and read up and continually sharpen up your personal security. Read about local busts in your local paper to see how it went down. You get the picture. But avoid anyone who has been busted, they could be looking to get a lighter sentence in return for co-operating with LE.   Obviously never sell to anyone you don't know. It sounds obvious but many a drug dealer has been caught by an undercover with a pile of cash saying that they're wanting to make a big buy.   Watch documentaries about RL drug cases. You can never know or learn too much.  The main thing to remember is if ever the worst happens and you are arrested, don't get spooked and not think straight and freak out and start confessing everything. They will lie and tell you they have incriminating things that they don't have in an attempt to get you to confess.   Calmly ask for a lawyer and remain silent until you get that lawyer no matter how long it takes (it can take as long as 2 days I read the other day) because you keeping silent and not talking to anyone keeps their defense options open.   There are public defenders in America whose job is to protect and defend. Make use of one of these should you get caught.  Unless you have a career and a way to prove you have a legit income then use one of these public defenders. After they read you your rights then ask for a lawyer and remain silent until the lawyer arrives.   If you're say, a high flying broker with piles of money that you can prove you earned legally then keep a decent attorney on a retainer as an insurance policy against arrest and winning your liberty.  I think that remembering to keep silent upon arrest, and good opsec, would get you far further than trying to pose as LE on a LE forum in the same way they pose as drug users on drug forums. I honestly doubt they'd say anything about tactics we don't know already.  We all know that they come to the forums on the dnms and try to become (or do become) valued and respected community members. They'll often be the ones dishing out security advice, because they're so wonderful and helpful they couldn't possibly be LE, right? Perhaps they'll be the one who's always there, who's always or often online making jokes peppered with bits of advice here and there. Just as rapists don't walk around in t-shirts with ""I am a rapist"" on them and are charming until they get their claws into their victim, undercover officers tend to do all that they can to appear legit.   Perhaps they'll even outright joke that they're LE, cause they couldn't be if they're joking about it, right? Funnily enough they'll accidentally slip and refer to drug addicts in a sneering way from time to time. They can't help it and they post no practical advice on drug use/ drug safety measures- cause they don't know and they likely want us scumbag junkies all to OD anyway. Once they've busted us, that is. They won't post anecdotes about the time they get really fucked up on acid, because of course they didn't ever and they realize their posts are being archived by their superiors. They'll also have no real fear or paranoia. cirrus was posting during all the sr1 forum mod busts as if he had no cares in the world. Because he didn't and was probably on cloud 9 thinking about his soon to be promotion.  The FBI is actively recruiting people with degrees in all kind of computer, deepweb, PGP, BTC and crypto- type specialists. The deepweb is developing real fast and most of the time they're catching people using old-fashioned police work, but in an ideal world they want to be several steps ahead of DNM operators and their dev teams. They got Ross from a security fail he made using his real email and they got Blake through a security fail of hiring several undercover officers as mods and admins, plus him using his real email to rent the SR2 servers. Well, the jury's out they may well have straight up just used NSA help.   But whatever, my point is read up as much as you can to protect your best asset - your life and your freedom.   Their biggest weapon is human stupidity, exploiting peoples' trusting natures and social engineering.   Look at how Ross Ulbricht was yapping away to an undercover agent in the sr1 irc chatroom at the time he was busted. That helped them know he was logged on so they could get him with his laptop open. Also in the indictment an UC asked casually in irc something like ""does your girlfriend know about you being Dread?"" and he replied, ""No, no way"" or something - all these seemingly little slips can add up to proof that you're a certain person doing a certain thing when they're building a case. They rely on people maybe being high, lonely and chatty.  So keep your mouth shut and your eyes open and always trust your instincts - don't ever write something off as paranoia. Better to be paranoid and free than locked up in a federal open all hours 24/7 motel.   Forget this other idea and maybe edit out the details of what you tried to access and when in your original post or better yet maybe delete it.   I do like the idea of you compiling a tactics sheet, but your time would probably be better spent right now focusing on you and your situation, cause no offence but it sounds to me like you need to brush up on your OPSEC and you might have been stoned when you thought up this idea without thinking it through properly with all the possible consequences.  Peace out.      ","Anyone heard of the the forums (xxxxxxxx redacted) ?  Could they be using shitty opsec, could there possibly be some low hanging fruit there for someone that knows there business?  Made this post on a whim.  I do not expect someone to spend there day breaking into these forums for a complete stranger.  I was just hoping you guys could point me to someone reliable that I could pay to do this, or someone idealistic enough to do this for free so that I may compile a guide of tactics.

Even if you somehow did manage to get into the sections reserved for sworn officers, I doubt you'd find anything really of use.

On www.deepdotweb.com they post the affadavits of marketplace busts. I have found these very useful. The overarching rule seems to be that right from the very beginning, you need to establish a protocol for conducting yourself online.   Decide what you're hoping to hide, and from whom, and fashion a protocol around this. Thereafter, never deviate from protocol. If you read the details of criminal complaints, you'll be shocked at how many get busted from being plain sloppy. As I have a certain degree of faith in people's intelligence, I would say that rather than being total retards full stop, they simply got complacent and lazy over time.     I should qualify my statement: cheap burner phone bought with cash, SIM and credit bought with cash or anonymous debit card.   Mind you, trying to deceive them with a voicemail message doesn't really appeal to me and isn't really the strategy I would use. Instead, if I were going to do this, I would attempt to obtain officer records with badge number (e.g. Cop Block), along with a sworn affadavit by the cop from a criminal complaint found online. In the opening paragraphs, the officer will state their current position in detail. I was able to find a cop's badge number, and all the details of their position, but not for the same officer. This is the tricky bit. I have a feeling that the ideal candidate would be a crooked cop that's been outed on Cop Block, followed by the criminal complain made against them.  I would further add: By disclosing your intentions publically, you've burned this plan by a good few months. I would say LE has been reading this thread and already given them a heads up. Lay low and in 6 or so months, revisit this. ","Fuck Reddit. The best sources are court filings/documents, if you can get your hands on them.

I've seen articles in the last few months that allege that hard drive firmware can be altered, permanently, thus embedding a piece of spyware into your hard drive. Formatting/DBANing, etc. will not remove it -- the drive would have to be disassembled, and the firmware physically removed/replaced to clean the drive. When you get to the point that you can no longer trust the hardware, let alone the software, then it's game over.  The only thing that protecting all of us is that, for the time being at least, it is still somewhat difficult to compromise a user's hardware/software. When it becomes a simple thing, e.g. an automated process, then we're all fucked. I fully expect this to happen in the next 10 years, by which time I'll probably drop off the Net.

ZaphodP.S.: It's time like this that make me glad that I'm an old man.;  According to an in-depth report from security company, Kapersky Labs, the National Security Agency (NSA) could be planting advanced malware in HDD firmware, giving the NSA unprecedented access to computers from all over the world. Cyber-espionage group Equation is reportedly responsible for creating the malware, which uses previously undiscovered techniques to plant malware on HDD's so that it's undetectable and currently is virtually impossible to get rid of - even formatting the drive or using software such as dban to wipe it clean won't do the trick.The malware takes advantage of exploits identified in HDD's from almost every known major manufacturer to basically reprogram the drive's existing firmware, creating secret sectors that are only accessible through an API (application programming interface).Equation uses a toolset that's remarkably similar to what the NSA has used in the past (based on leaked documents from 2013). While Kapersky Labs can't say outrightly that the NSA is involved, the report certainly insinuates it. One has to wonder how the NSA has managed to get access to the HDD manufacturers firmware.................. "

It might be overkill, but if you're not confident about what constitutes identifying info then it's the best course of action (although in this case you should be careful about posting on forums, and try to learn a bit more about profiling etc). And yeah, adding more noise to the signal seems a worthwhile thing to do.  I just wanted to point out that lack of a PGP key in my profile on this forum doesn't mean I don't know or use PGP in other contexts. Still, it is true that a shocking number of people just don't bother with it, according to vendors. So all friendly encouragement is good.","Well, hexeh, personally, I'd want to encrypt ANY personal communications not directly intended for a forum, regardless of whether I thought any compromising details were in the message. I don't think I'm smart enough to make sure that nothing I say contains personal identifiers, etc. Plus, there's always the old argument of adding more ""noise"" to the ""signal"".

Zaphod  The Government Tells Ross Ulbricht He Owes It $183,961,921 Written by Kari Paul (Contributor) May 28, 2015 // 05:37 PM EST   http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-government-tells-ross-ulbricht-he-owes-them-183961921?trk_source=recommended  As Ross Ulbricht waits to hear if he will spend the rest of his life in prison for the creation of deep web marketplace Silk Road, the government has filed an order requesting he pay up a major fee equal to transactions that took place on the site.  In a memo on Thursday, government prosecutors imposed a money judgement against the Ulbricht equal to $183,961,921. They came to that number based on the transactional records from Silk Road showing the amount of illegal drug sales as $182,960,285 combined with the transactions for fake identification equal to $1,001,636.  The government contends Ulbricht is liable for all transactions on Silk Road because of the structure of the site.  âSilk Road automatically laundered all proceeds passing through its Bitcoin-based payment system, including by passing them through a âtumblerâ whose sole purpose was to obfuscate the source and nature of the funds,â the government wrote. âHence, Ulbricht is liable for a money judgment in the amount of all the criminal proceeds laundered through Silk Road, regardless of the extent he personally retained those funds.â  Ulbricht will be required to pay the full amount of money, which is likely not dischargeable in bankruptcy, according to Braden Perry, partner in the Kansas City-based law firm of Kennyhertz Perry, LLC and former federal enforcement attorney.  âThese types of fines are typical if the government can trace the funds to the illicit conduct,â Perry said. âSelling the illicit goods online made it easy for the government to trace the funds.â  The government noted that the pending civil forfeiture against Ulbricht, which includes the bitcoins found on his laptop at the time of his arrest, can be credited to the judgement. That includes 700,000 bitcoins, which were worth $13.4 million at the time of transactions but are worth $166,124,000 at current conversion rates.  That would leave Ulbricht with $17,837,921 left to pay upânot a negligible fee, especially when the 31-year-old and his family are struggling to gather funds for his appeal process.  Ulbricht faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life. He will be sentenced tomorrow at 1 PM in a New York courthouse.  ",""

Mollo Building One Saint Andrewâs Plaza New York, New York 10007  May 28, 2015  By ECF  Hon. Katherine B. Forrest United States District Judge Southern District of New York Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse 500 Pearl Street New York, New York 10007  Re: United States v. Ross William Ulbricht, 14 Cr. 68 (KBF)  Dear Judge Forrest:  In connection with sentencing in this matter, scheduled for tomorrow, the Government respectfully submits the attached proposed Preliminary Order of Forfeiture / Money Judgment. At sentencing, the Government will ask the Court to enter the proposed order, which will impose a money judgment against the defendant in the amount of $183,961,921. This figure reflects the total Silk Road sales specifically categorized in transactional records recovered from the Silk Road server as either illegal drug sales ($182,960,285) or sales of false identification documents ($1,001,636). (GX-940A; GX-940B; Tr. dated Feb. 2, 2015, at 1929:1-1934:13). These sales represent a conservative estimate of (a) the amount of proceeds the defendant âobtained, directly or indirectly,â as a result of the offenses in Counts One through Six, see 21 U.S.C. Â§ 853 & 18 U.S.C. Â§ 982(a)(2)(B), and (b) the value of the property âinvolved inâ the money laundering offense in Count Seven, see 18 U.S.C. Â§ 982(a)(1). [1]   With respect to (a), the term âobtainedâ applies to property obtained by third parties acting in concert with the defendant. âA court may order a defendant to forfeit proceeds received by others who participated jointly in the crime, provided the actions generating those proceeds were reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.â United States v. Contorinis, 692 F.3d 136, 147 (2d Cir. 2012). Accordingly, because sales of illegal drugs and false identification documents conducted by Silk Road vendors were foreseeable to Ulbricht, he is subject to  ---------------------------------------- [1] Because some Silk Road sales are uncategorized in the transactional records recovered from the Silk Road server, the actual volume of sales of drugs and false identification documents is believed to be higher. Furthermore, because computer hacking tools and services were sold along with other types of computer-related listings under various categories (e.g., âDigital Goodsâ and âComputer Equipmentâ), figures are not readily available as to proceeds specifically tied to the computer-hacking count (Count Five), and thus they are not included in this estimate.                                                 1  Case 1:14-cr-00068-KBF Document 262 Filed 05/28/15 Page 2 of 2  forfeiture with respect to the proceeds of those sales in their entirety â not just the portion that he personally retained as commissions.   With respect to (b), âeven where a defendant does not retain laundered property he will be subject to substitution of assets [i.e., a money judgment] so long as he conducted at least three separate transactions in any twelve-month period involving a total of $100,000 or more.â United States v. Bermudez, 413 F.3d 304, 306 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. Â§ 982(b)(2)). Ulbricht was involved in laundering many more than three transactions in a twelve-month period, involving funds worth well beyond $100,000. Silk Road automatically laundered all proceeds passing through its Bitcoin-based payment system, including by passing them through a âtumblerâ whose sole purpose was to obfuscate the source and nature of the funds. (See GX- 119; Tr. dated Jan. 14, 2015, at 213:14-215:22). Hence, Ulbricht is liable for a money judgment in the amount of all the criminal proceeds laundered through Silk Road, regardless of the extent he personally retained those funds.  Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court enter the attached proposed order at the conclusion of sentencing. The Government notes that there is a pending civil forfeiture action against Ulbricht, seeking, among other things, forfeiture of the bitcoins that the Government seized from Ulbrichtâs computer hardware. See United States v. Ross William Ulbricht, No. 13 Civ. 6919 (JPO) (S.D.N.Y.). The civil forfeiture action has been stayed pending the resolution of Ulbrichtâs criminal case. Upon the forfeiture of the bitcoins from Ulbrichtâs computer in the civil forfeiture action, the value of those forfeited bitcoins will be applied toward the money judgment sought herein.

SRF1","General Discussion/Security","With the ongoing troubles of the darknet it is becoming a much harder game for the big guys to stick around. Verto and Kimble saw the writing on the wall and picked a time when to get out. Dont believe me? Ask any of the remaining Evo staff members who are around. I believe it was Kimble who said something was due to happen with DNMs soon. This was said a couple weeks before the fuckers took everyones coins.  There are many in our community here on the darknet that are experts in security. Back on the original Silk Road we shared our security knowledge so we could all better protect ourselves. I am a firm believe that it is even necessary for the end user or buyer to use the most hardened security.  At the very least vendors need to be using secure setups. I can name 2 semi-large vendors from back on SR2 who were both running the TBB by itself on an Apple computer along with public wifi. One of them even kept JS enabled. I taught them both about one of the most simple tools to use. Tails. These two vendors are still around and more popular then ever. Its frighting to think what would be the case if they had been targeted by LE.  Something that is very likely. Busts happen all the time. LE is constantly trying to get what they can. When you do not protect yourself as much as possible it is simple negligence. Only you can protect yourself. Never has a person witnessed the inside of a jail cell because they were too safe.   Certain large vendors have been around long enough that they are starting to get comfortable. The moment we let our guard down the adversary jumps on us. They always persist. There is no stopping the evil that is Law Enforcement. These problems are not small and will not go away unless we keep reteaching the knowledge. Adding to it as much as we can.  LE has now had time with hidden services. LE understands them more. We are becoming easier targets. As time moves forward so should our security.  So I pose the question to all with much greater knowledge then I, if security experts like astor, pine, Nightcrawler, or the many others, were still around posting under the same nyms, what would they recommend to be the safest set up for the largest of targets.  Is Windows XP with onion.to/tor2web in internet explorer really good enough?  Below are some wonderful links thanks to the great Alfred. You can read through the posts of some of our communities greats. At first I thought I would go through posts and paste the best information here.

SRF1","General Discussion/Security","   While you make some valid points Fred, in all honesty there is no 100% fail safe highly secure operating system one could use. It's a combination of factors which when used in conjunction with each other, can offer the end user a much lower risk of being pwned. It's all about minimizing your risks so that the chances of you ever being de-anonymized are as low as they can possibly be which is why I believe Isolation, particularly physical isolation, is vitally important in ones setup as well as hardening the OS you intend to use, thus reducing your attack surface.   @Cornelius23 - Fantasy may have inspired many real world applications however in relation to protecting your anonymity and privacy from prying eyes, I for one will be sticking with evidence based, proven techniques only. In the real world, it's much easier to turn dreams into reality when there are no potential life changing legal repercussions to contend with however in the world of the deep web, turning a dream into a secure, functional reality is a more complex, time consuming task than one would face if creating something similar (and legal) to use on the clearnet such as an e-commerce site. Basically what I'm trying to say is going from the early conception of an idea through to a thoroughly tested, secure and functional application is not as simple as some may think, especially when there is a lot to loose if users could potentially de-anonymized as a result of using such an application. Improving on things already being used is another option available which can also lead to the creation and development of new ideas.     ","Dj Bernstein uses Qubes according to his twitter (as he wanted to spin up new VMs without giving them access to the internal mic) and that guy is probably the preeminent security researcher on earth right now. Problem with Qubes is it's not a live system, you have to install it and if you live in the UK or other despotic regime where you can be forced to hand over crypto keys you're screwed. VMs leave all kinds of metadata lying around in memory/swap/everywhere. You can't just spin up a new VM, download your encrypted files and open them, then shut it down/delete that VM and expect no forensics left behind. It will leak all over the system which is why a live OS running on a barebones system is desireable so nothing is kept to find. For anybody who doesn't know Qubes is basically hardened Xen. There's a root system where you launch numerous VMs at the same time, such as your ""Bank browser VM"" which is configured for security for banking, or your ""Browse malicious sites VM"" where javascript is disabled. The idea is to keep contacts and other private information in seperate VMs from one's that are exposed to outside connections/browsers. It works great for joe blow business guy, or a professional bitcoin or stock trader. You can make your own Qubes OS with Alpine Linux and Xen kernel too if you wanted."

Researchers at Tel Aviv University and Israelâs Technion research institute have developed a new palm-sized device that can wirelessly steal data from a nearby laptop based on the radio waves leaked by its processorâs power use. Their spy bug, built for less than $300, is designed to allow anyone to âlistenâ to the accidental radio emanations of a computerâs electronics from 19 inches away and derive the userâs secret decryption keys, enabling the attacker to read their encrypted communications. And that device, described in a paper theyâre presenting at the Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems in September, is both cheaper and more compact than similar attacks from the pastâso small, in fact, that the Israeli researchers demonstrated it can fit inside a piece of pita bread.  âThe result is that a computer that holds secrets can be readily tapped with such cheap and compact items without the user even knowing he or she is being monitored,â says Eran Tomer, a senior lecturer in computer science at Tel Aviv University. âWe showed itâs not just possible, itâs easy to do with components you can find on eBay or even in your kitchen.â  Their key-stealing device, which they call the Portable Instrument for Trace Acquisition (yes, that spells PITA) consists of a loop of wire to act as an antenna, a Rikomagic controller chip, a Funcube software defined radio, and batteries. It can be configured to either collect its cache of stolen data on an SD storage card or to transmit it via Wifi to a remote eavesdropper. The idea to actually cloak the device in a pitaâand name it as suchâwas a last minute addition, Tomer says. The researchers found a piece of the bread in their lab on the night before their deadline and discovered that all their electronics could fit inside it. pita[1] The Laboratory for Experimental Information Security at Tel Aviv University  The Tel Aviv researchers focused their attack on extracting the keys stored by GnuPG, an open source and widely used version of the encryption software PGP. They alerted GnuPG to their work in February, and an update to the software released at the same time as their paper is designed to protect against the attack. But they say their key-stealing method could be applied to other crypto systems that use RSA and ElGamal, the cryptographic algorithms integrated into GnuPG. Tromer says the group is also exploring whether the technique could be adapted and made more widely applicable, too, even allowing the theft of bitcoins by stealing the private keys created by usersâ âwalletâ programs. Their paper includes recommendations for how cryptographers can alter software to better foil their radio key thieving mechanism.  The Israeli researchersâ ability to steal data from unwitting computersâ radio waves isnât exactly new: Computer scientists have known for decades that computers leak sensitive data in the form of radio emissions from their electromagnetic components. The Dutch security researcher Wim van Eck demonstrated back in 1985 that he could pick up the radio emissions of CRT monitors and reconstruct on-screen images. In 2008, German and Iranian researchers used a similar radio analysis trick to âlistenâ to the computations inside wireless key fobs and clone them to unlock cars and open garage doors.  But the Tel Aviv researchersâ technique uses that same form of radio spying to target a laptopâa far more electromagnetically complicated target than a key fob or a monitorâand also to do it on the cheap. The team cleverly reduced the resources necessary for their attack by sampling the radio emanations from the processor only intermittently, while the chip does its decryption work of reading those emissions at a much faster frequency. PITA takes its samples at 100 kiloherz compared with the processorâs 20,000-times-faster computation rate of two gigaherz. But by tricking the target into decrypting a carefully chosen message, they were able to âtwist the algorithmâs armâ into leaking more sensitive information, creating more clues in the leaked emanations for their PITA radio to pick up.1  âItâs like someoneâs reciting secrets in a room, and you only get to hear a syllable a day to try to reconstruct what theyâre saying,â says Tromer. âYou can force that person in the room to always say one syllable over and over if the secret is âzero,â and another syllable over and over if the secret is âoneââ¦That allows us to take a very low frequency sample and still extract information.â  The notion of someone planting an eavesdropping device less than two feet away from a target computer may seem farfetched as an espionage techniqueâeven if that spy device is concealed in a pita (a potentially conspicuous object in certain contexts) or a stealthier disguise like a book or trashcan. But the PITA attack represents a significant advancement from less than a year ago, when the same researchers released an attack that required the attacker to actually touch a laptopâs metal components to pick up their charge.  Tromer says the team is now working on another upgrade that would allow much longer-distance snooping, though he declined to say more before the researchâs publication. If that more remote attack becomes practical, it could introduce the threat of radio-based crypto key theft through walls or floorsâwithout even a telltale sandwich to warn the user their secrets are being stolen.",""

I was in love with this girl for the past 6 years.  We dated throughout college and 2 years post grad.  I was a phenomenal partner.  My love, respect, loyalty and admiration for her was always absolute.  She would continually say how amazing I am, and how she wants no one to have me but her, etc.. etc..   Out of the blue, seriously, out of nowhere she says to me she wants time for herself.  This makes no sense because I am so close with her, so close with her family, and her with mine. We had plans for months in advance, the next weekend, etc.. It was just so wholly unexpected--and fishy.  I had done everything for this girl.  My first true love.  When she couldn't find work, I paid her rent.  I was the one who evnetually got her a job through my connections.  If she needed help with anything I was always there. If her family needed money, I would help them out no questions asked, no money needed to be repaid.  I treated her like my wife and future mother of my children.  I placed her above myself on so many occasions I cannot even account because it was my intention to marry her, and I thought it was hers as well based on interactions, conversations, and longevity of the relationship.  So, she says she wants to be by herself to focus on herself because she has been in a relationship for the past 6 years, all of college, and then some.  I understood, I also thought maybe it would be good for me to explore myself also as I was in the same boat, and if it happens that we get back together, then it happens.  The thing is, events leading up to the breakup were very strange.  We broke up on a Saturday.  That Monday morning I was over at her place, having slept there the night before as I would often do.  She wrote me the most magnificent note about her love for me and how there is so much for us to do together. Things are great all week.  Tuesday, she comes over and I help her out with work stuff.  Wednesday I don't see her, but we talk.  Thursday she comes over again for more work help.  Friday I don't see her, but make plans for Saturday, and we had dinner plans for Sunday for a function.  Saturday she comes over and we break up out of no where.  Nothing out of the ordinary, everything going well, nothing to tip me off to this.  I guess some background about me.  I am no sap, I'm a good-looking, intelligent, well-mannered man who is the real deal. I make good money, I have an above average cock, and I am a nice guy, to a fault I suppose.  ""A nice Jewish boy""   This really blind-sided me.  Rug pulled out from under me, world spun into chaos.  I am usually very good at compartmentalizing things.  My first major was psychology, and I understand a lot.  I usually don't let emotions get the better of me, I am very pragmatic and realistic, but this really got to me. It was just so strange for this to happen. Two weeks pass where we barely speak.  I finally say enough is enough, I want to get back together.  She isn't having it. A month goes by, I would periodically show up at her apartment cause I have the keys and we would have sex, she would be happy to see me, all is going well, making plans for the following weekend, back on track, or so I thought.  A few more weeks of this hot and cold and she decides no more.  It has come to the point where I have to get away because that city just reminds me of her and I had to escape.  I ended up moving.  While leaving, I stopped by her place to get some things I had left.  While there, I found a note.  From another man.  ""Hey beautiful, good to see you, plans for next weekend etc..""  I just saw red.  I ended up taking everything from this girl that I had bought her.  Clothes, jewlery, electronics, art, anything I bought for her, I just took it, destroyed it, or threw it out.  I basically blacked out / had a 3rd person moment where I wasn't in control.   That 15 hour drive to my new destination was the most dangerous stretch of my life.  The thoughts going through my head were unbearable. I was and admittedly, still am a bit of a wreck.  Finally after getting to my new place, a city where I don't know anyone, not even a job yet, just a lot of prospects and its a booming city, so I'm not too worried about that, but its still a big life adjustment compared to my previous trajectory.   I finally get settled, and one of the things I took from her that I gave her was a Kindle Fire.  It still had her email signed in.  I don't know the password, but its still signed into her email.  I read some emails.  She had been cheating on me for awhile, while we were still together.  With this guy we both knew in College.  With one of her exs from back home.  And with this new guy.  You devote yourself so fully to someone, you do the right thing, the proper thing, and for someone to mistreat you like that.  I know not all people are good, and I like to think I'm a good judge of character, and I had been with her for so long, no signs of it at all.  Its just deflating.  Months have passed and I am still not over it.  I am just not able to take the high road on this one, and I need some kind of revenge.  I don't know what to do, but something must be done, and I am hoping someone could talk to me, or point me in the right direction of what to do.  I don't want to hear ""Live your life better than theirs.""  I've been doing that and this still weighs on me.  I cannot let her get away with this so cleanly.    So to the point.  Thank you if you have kept up so far, I know I said I would try and keep it brief, but I started, and I had to flow.   I have a lot of her sensitive information.  Mother's maiden name, SSN, recent credit report, usernames(no passwords) Driver's License #, I know how much she makes bi-weekly, frequently used PIN, Last 4 digits of debt card, plus expiration date, plus I'm sure more information if I knew what I needed and someone could tell me.  I just don't know what to do from here.  Something must be done, and if anyone could present some ideas, or if anyone wants her info and you can do what you will with it, by all means, have at it.  She has a good credit score, not a lot of student debt, no credit cards, no priors.  I dunno.  I hope this isn't a breach of the Rules/CoC.  It said no DoXing on community members, and she is not a community member.  Definitely not a tech-savvy person.   I dunno.  Someone talk to me, present me some ideas please.  If a moderator feels the need to take it down, then go ahead, I am not trying to disrupt this community.  If you do take it down, could you at least point me in the direction of where I should go to get something done though?",""

Don't be annoyed if you get some answers back that you don't like.    What strikes me as odd, out of this whole situation, is your continued reiteration of just how great you are. Narcissistic tendencies, perhaps?     Plans for  months in advance? Really? And you're wondering why she suddenly wants time to herself?

From that perspective, you already had everything mapped-out; you had everything already planned. It comes as no surprise that she would want to flee such a relationship.    She may have been vacillating about her decision.      This is understandable -- one's first love, one's first crush, has a power like no other subsequent relationship.    That settles it, then -- the Lord and Master hath spoken!   How DARE your bought-and-paid-for possession DEFY you? How dare she not acknowledge your rights as Liege Lord of the Manor!    Good move.      Good thing she didn't try to pursue you for theft and/or destruction of property -- she would have been well within her rights to do so. You would have had to plead temporary insanity in an attempt to avoid conviction. (A mitigating factor would have been that multiple people had keys to her apartment, so there is no smoking gun pointing to you, except what you have written here.)    You  do realize, do you not, that you have just admitted to the commission of a felony? People have been sentenced to jail, and saddled with a criminal record for less.   Do yourself a favor -- smash the Kindle Fire, and bin it somewhere.    Yes, it is, but you are going to have to put it behind you.    You are going to  have to take the high road on this one, at least you will if you are half-intelligent. You are going to have to chalk this up to a life-lesson, close the door to this part of the past behind you, and continue to move forward. If you fail to do so, it will only fester, and effectively poison the rest of your life (including future relationships).    Whether you like it or not, you're going to have to, because to do otherwise is to risk a criminal record, and having a criminal record will absolutely do  wonders for your future prospects, won't it?    Forget about it, and just walk away.    Something must be done!  Says who?  Ooooh, I forgot... the Lord of the Manor speaks! Everyone must immediately spring into action!   You know, it was very likely this type of control-freak attitude that drove her from you in the first place. If I were in your shoes, I'd be getting some counseling, and working to change that, ASAP, before it destroys your next relationship.   Zaphod  ","I will try and be as brief, yet descriptive as possible without making this whiney or sob-story like.  I guess I need protection of anonymity in order to speak my mind and ask for advice, help. ;I was in love with this girl for the past 6 years.  We dated throughout college and 2 years post grad. I was a phenomenal partner.  My love, respect, loyalty and admiration for her was always absolute. She would continually say how amazing I am, and how she wants no one to have me but her, etc.. etc.. ;Out of the blue, seriously, out of nowhere she says to me she wants time for herself. This makes no sense because I am so close with her, so close with her family, and her with mine. We had plans for months in advance, the next weekend, etc.. It was just so wholly unexpected--and fishy. ;I had done everything for this girl.  My first true love.  When she couldn't find work, I paid her rent.  I was the one who evnetually got her a job through my connections.  If she needed help with anything I was always there. If her family needed money, I would help them out no questions asked, no money needed to be repaid.  I treated her like my wife and future mother of my children.  I placed her above myself on so many occasions I cannot even account because it was my intention to marry her, and I thought it was hers as well based on interactions, conversations, and longevity of the relationship. ;So, she says she wants to be by herself to focus on herself because she has been in a relationship for the past 6 years, all of college, and then some.  I understood, I also thought maybe it would be good for me to explore myself also as I was in the same boat, and if it happens that we get back together, then it happens.The thing is, events leading up to the breakup were very strange. We broke up on a Saturday. That Monday morning I was over at her place, having slept there the night before as I would often do. She wrote me the most magnificent note about her love for me and how there is so much for us to do together. Things are great all week.  Tuesday, she comes over and I help her out with work stuff.  Wednesday I don't see her, but we talk.  Thursday she comes over again for more work help.  Friday I don't see her, but make plans for Saturday, and we had dinner plans for Sunday for a function.  Saturday she comes over and we break up out of no where.  Nothing out of the ordinary, everything going well, nothing to tip me off to this. ;I guess some background about me.  I am no sap, I'm a good-looking, intelligent, well-mannered man who is the real deal. I make good money, I have an above average cock, and I am a nice guy, to a fault I suppose.  ""A nice Jewish boy"" This really blind-sided me. Rug pulled out from under me, world spun into chaos. I am usually very good at compartmentalizing things.  My first major was psychology, and I understand a lot.  I usually don't let emotions get the better of me, I am very pragmatic and realistic, but this really got to me. ;It was just so strange for this to happen. Two weeks pass where we barely speak.  I finally say enough is enough, I want to get back together. ;She isn't having it. A month goes by, I would periodically show up at her apartment cause I have the keys and we would have sex, she would be happy to see me, all is going well, making plans for the following weekend, back on track, or so I thought.  A few more weeks of this hot and cold and she decides no more. ;It has come to the point where I have to get away because that city just reminds me of her and I had to escape.  I ended up moving. ;While leaving, I stopped by her place to get some things I had left.  While there, I found a note.  From another man.  ""Hey beautiful, good to see you, plans for next weekend etc..""  I just saw red.  I ended up taking everything from this girl that I had bought her.  Clothes, jewlery, electronics, art, anything I bought for her, I just took it, destroyed it, or threw it out.  I basically blacked out / had a 3rd person moment where I wasn't in control. ;... I finally get settled, and one of the things I took from her that I gave her was a Kindle Fire.  It still had her email signed in.  I don't know the password, but its still signed into her email. I read some emails.  She had been cheating on me for awhile, while we were still together.  With this guy we both knew in College.  With one of her exs from back home.  And with this new guy. ;You devote yourself so fully to someone, you do the right thing, the proper thing, and for someone to mistreat you like that.  I know not all people are good, and I like to think I'm a good judge of character, and I had been with her for so long, no signs of it at all.  Its just deflating. ;Months have passed and I am still not over it.  I am just not able to take the high road on this one ;... and I need some kind of revenge. I don't know what to do, but something must be done, and I am hoping someone could talk to me, or point me in the right direction of what to do.  I don't want to hear ""Live your life better than theirs.""  I've been doing that and this still weighs on me.  I cannot let her get away with this so cleanly. ;So to the point.  Thank you if you have kept up so far, I know I said I would try and keep it brief, but I started, and I had to flow. I have a lot of her sensitive information.  Mother's maiden name, SSN, recent credit report, usernames(no passwords) Driver's License #, I know how much she makes bi-weekly, frequently used PIN, Last 4 digits of debt card, plus expiration date, plus I'm sure more information if I knew what I needed and someone could tell me. ;I just don't know what to do from here.  Something must be done, and if anyone could present some ideas, or if anyone wants her info and you can do what you will with it, by all means, have at it.  She has a good credit score, not a lot of student debt, no credit cards, no priors.  I dunno.  I hope this isn't a breach of the Rules/CoC.  It said no DoXing on community members, and she is not a community member.  Definitely not a tech-savvy person.

"The Hub Forums","InNeedofHelp","9813.0","2015-06-08T23:41:57","I need some help, advice, talking to about revenge.","Start Here/For Beginners","I want to first thank everyone for your replies.  I admit, I really didn't think I would find this kind of compassion on this forum, but I have been pleasantly, pleasantly surprised.  Thank you everyone, it means a lot to be understood and given advice from 3rd parties.  I definitely feel like this has been toxic to my psyche and personal well-being and I will begin taking steps to move on, first by wiping the Kindle I bought her of her logins.  To address why I have her sensitive information:  I did not seek out this info with malicious intent.  She doesn't have internet at her place, so she would often work at my residence.  On my computer when cleaning out one of her folders, I found a lot of documents that had this information.  If I chose to follow through with these actions, it would be malicious, but the way I attained the info was not. I felt like that deserved some clarification.  Specifically to Zaphod, thank you for taking the time to address each issue paragraph by paragraph, and if I may return in kind because I feel like some of it was written hastily without enough context.  I do appreciate you looking at it from her point of view, and I know I have, but I unintentionally omitted some details that will undoubtably help understand my perplexion and behaviors.  I had never thought of her as a posession, but I do feel jilted that she would have me pay for so much(she would ask, sometimes I would offer) and after this has unfolded, I feel used.  It was never, I am paying for your life, so you must do as I say, thats just not in me.  Regardless, thank you very much for your insight and I will definitely begin the healing process.  I hope you don't take my responses as defensive, just me trying to help you understand the scope of things as to why I feel so grievously wronged.  ","Zaphod:Fair enough. Don't be annoyed if you get some answers back that you don't like. -I came here for honesty, and that is what I got.  All of the answers were good, especially the amusing one about me being in a semi-open quasi relationship, that made me laugh.What strikes me as odd, out of this whole situation, is your continued reiteration of just how great you are. Narcissistic tendencies, perhaps? Definitely not.  I grew up with ugly duck syndrome.  I was overweight and unattractive most of my life.  It wasn't until college that I blossomed physically, but I still feel like that overweight nerd who logged hours upon hours in Everquest(I miss that game).  I have come to realize that there is no greater injustice in the world than how people look, and how they are treated because of their outward apperance.  Seeing both sides of the spectrum was really eye opening, and it has given me appreciation of people being people and nothing more. We are all equals regardless of our physical stature.  Thats not to say I am not completely not narcissistic, there are some things I do that I do very well and take great pride in.  No matter, I will better evaluate this comment in my daily life and see if it holds more weight than I initially thought. About me being a great partner, this was from her.  She would write me notes or say things to me like: I am the best, she doesn't want anyone to have me but her, I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, she wouldn't do anything to jeoprodize this, she wants kids with me, she wants to marry me, talking about which part of town to buy a house in, I could go on.When I think of myself of being a good partner are a lot of the times when I could have strayed from the relationship and I didn't.  Or how I would go out of my way to make her happy.  By all accounts of social norm, I believe that I was a good significant other.Zaphod:Plans for months in advance? Really? And you're wondering why she suddenly wants time to herself? I think the answer is obvious -- she needs to get away from you. I've known people in similar situations, where the husband/boyfriend were control freaks. To me, this is what you sound like. Some context here.  There was a wedding for a friend of hers coming up later this year that I was supposed to attend.  That was what I meant by a plan months in advance. Its not like we had stuff mapped out weeks, months in advance, just that there was a plan for us to do something together that we had both been looking forward to, and she had just mentioned it days before the break up which is why it came to mind.Its funny to me thinking about this now, but she would always complain that I didn't call her enough.  Reason for this was partly because we had somewhat conflicting schedules during the week.  I would always say, why should I call you if you're just going to send me to voicemail because you're busy anyways?  Call me when you are done and are free to talk was what I would say.  Looking back now, I guess she wanted the gesture of the phone call more than anything.I was often the one who enjoyed my alone time to play video games, watch sports or decompress from work.Zaphod:I don't know you at all, but my impression of what you've written here is that you were smothering her -- she couldn't get away from you. I'm not saying that you were malicious or motivated by ill-intent-- on the contrary, I'm sure you had the best of intentions. I'm trying to potentially look at it through her eyes. She would come to me for help on these things, and I wanted to help.  After awhile, I guess it became expected. ""Oh my boyfriend will pay for it.""  I loved her, I had the extra money, I didn't want her to have to move away, or worse move in with me. I enjoy my independence. If anything, I was whipped.  She would say jump, I would say ""How High.""  My parents are still married going on many decades and I see what works, so I replicate that.  ""Happy wife, happy life"" is not just a silly saying, its the rule to live by when in a committed relationship. Zaphod:This is understandable -- one's first love, one's first crush, has a power like no other subsequent relationship. This was my first big one, and given my inexperience in the area, it made it all the more powerful.  She grew up attractive, and incredibly narcissistic.  She would say things like ""If I wasn't as good looking as I am, I would kill myself.""  Psycho stuff.  All these warning signs and red flags that you never realize until after the relationship has been terminated.  Hindsight is 20/20.  So she was used to and very experienced in relationships, me not so much.  This has got to be why its been so hard on me. Zaphod:That settles it, then -- the Lord and Master hath spoken!Yea, the way I phrased that doesn't sound good.Zaphod:How DARE your bought-and-paid-for possession DEFY you? How dare she not acknowledge your rights as Liege Lord of the Manor! Again, doesn't sound good but I am paraphrasing.  The times we would be together post-breakup, things were going great, like nothing was wrong. We would make plans and it seemed like we were back together.  As soon as one of us left the other's place, it was back to that breakup mode.  So much back and forth.  Zaphod:Good move. Yes, I am in a much better city now.  I just haven't felt like myself in quite some time, and that goes back to how this is toxic for me and I need to move on.Zaphod:Good thing she didn't try to pursue you for theft and/or destruction of property -- she would have been well within her rights to do so. You would have had to plead temporary insanity in an attempt to avoid conviction. (A mitigating factor would have been that multiple people had keys to her apartment, so there is no smoking gun pointing to you, except what you have written here.) Yea, what I did here was bad, really bad.  No denying that.  Time has passed since this happened, not past the statute of limitations, but clearly enough time that I feel more comfortable talking about it.  If I had been paying rent, and I bought all of those posessions, I made sure not to touch anything that was actually hers, does that still make me culpable? These items can easily be tracked back to me via credit cards and receipts.  Heck, the Kindle is under my name and Amazon account.Zaphod:You do realize, do you not, that you have just admitted to the commission of a felony? People have been sentenced to jail, and saddled with a criminal record for less. Do yourself a favor -- smash the Kindle Fire, and bin it somewhere.I'm just going to reset it to factory condition so that it removes all of her data and give it to a niece or nephew.  Kindles are amazing and I highly recommend anyone get one if they have an Amazon Prime account. Cannot stress my love for Kindle Fire enough.   Zaphod:Yes, it is, but you are going to have to put it behind you. I am going to, in big part thanks to this community and everyone who has responded.  Thank you all again.Zaphod:You are going to have to take the high road on this one, at least you will if you are half-intelligent. You are going to have to chalk this up to a life-lesson, close the door to this part of the past behind you, and continue to move forward. If you fail to do so, it will only fester, and effectively poison the rest of your life (including future relationships). Yea, thats what I am going to do.  There will always be a part of me that is apprehensive, or maybe I just feel that because it is still relatively fresh.  Life lesson.  Zaphod:Whether you like it or not, you're going to have to, because to do otherwise is to risk a criminal record, and having a criminal record will absolutely do wonders for your future prospects, won't it? Forget about it, and just walk away. You know, it was very likely this type of control-freak attitude that drove her from you in the first place. If I were in your shoes, I'd be getting some counseling, and working to change that, ASAP, before it destroys your next relationship. If anything, I shouldn't be so complacent.  She isn't Jewish, but I guess going off my parent's relationship that I tried to emulate, the woman is the one in control of the household.  I was definitely not the controlling or possessive one.  I am type B, she is type A.  Her ethnic background is South American, and she was very jealous and possessive. Yea, I would get kinda jealous at times too, but she is a beautiful woman.  If she wasn't getting the attention of other men, then I wouldn't have been so attracted to her.  I never acted or complained about this though.  I was the subservient one in this relationship.  I am fairly laissez faire.  Maybe it was me not having enough of a spine and she felt she could walk all over me.  Again, hindsight. To be betrayed is such a bad feeling when you place so much of yourself into someone.---------------------Screw therapy. Zaphod, you should create a ""Dark Webs: The Ladies Man"" edition. It will be you in one of those 70's Purple Finger Chairs.  The room will be bright, but there will be a blackout light over your torso.  You can sip courvoisier and answer love relation questions.  Donations in bitcoins only of course.

You sound like you are pretty controlling and full of yourself, (we've all got something, yknow) which is probably ok when infatuation is still in effect, and I bet you're really attentive and romantic during that stage, but once the relationship becomes day in day out, as your GF, I'd start to wonder what it would be like to be with someone less ... uhhh... cloying... and with less need for constant validation about his above average cock (nothing could matter less than your size, especially at that point, btw).   The reason she didn't break up with you first, is that she wasn't sure. She just wanted to know what it was like. She thought she still loved you - she wanted to make sure. If she just stepped out once or twice, realized she still loved you, what you didn't know couldn't hurt you. But then things went further than she expected, and she had to admit to herself she was harboring feelings for other people.    But she also began to realize you'd mentally fracture and go psycho when she broke up with you. So she took some time thinking about how to do it in a way that would be least likely to turn you into a stalking psychopath. Finally, she realized there was no such way, so she weasled her way out with the old ""it's not you, it's me"" thing.  Eh, voilia - stalking psychopath.   Please, move on. Fuck that bitch, she doesn't deserve your attention, does she? This is about you. This rage, this vengeance you feel is toxic to you. It's going to twist you and stunt your growth as a person. If you want to be happy again in the future, dont go down this path, because you'll never be able to function in a relationship again. Get help if you need to, but I can't emphasize this enough... you're living in a toxic fantasy. if you try to make it reality, the one that will be fundamentally destroyed is you.",""
