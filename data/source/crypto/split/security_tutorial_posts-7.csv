PGP encryption is there for your protection more than the vendor. The vendor isn't disclosing any sensitive information unless otherwise. You can either stop the communication or you can carry on. It's strange that a vendor can't decrypt messages from his customers. You can never be too careful, anyone who can't communicate through encryption when required should be questioned in my opinion.From what you have said, it doesn't appear to be a fault of yours.All you have to do is goto your PGP software clipboard, input whatever you want to be encrypted then select his public key and send the encrypted message. All he has to do is do the same, copy to clipboard then decrypt and then do whatever he has to do. Tread carefully."

You should ALWAYS trust your basic instinct and ALWAYS use your common sense, not here but in any eventuality whether online or offline. If it's a large order and he's saying he can't decrypt the message then I'm presuming he hasn't shipped your item(s). I'd be filing a dispute and making the mods wary of what might occur, that way you have planned ahead. You can have the mods cancel the order and you will get your BTC back and then you can use a vendor who is more reliable. The true reasons could be legit, then again.. perhaps not. Also, having evidence of your communications is ideal also on the marketplace preferably and on the forums also that can be confirmed. After all, you've done nothing wrong UNTIL... you let the order AF and he gets the money. Don't risk it. Think wisely.

Card expensive hotels and avoid chargebacks.","Guides Vendors","So i was in search for hotels long time and finally i'm successfully carding hotels and staying at president apartaments and rooms for 500$-1000$ and i'm willing to sell my methods to you. I will admint that i suck at explaining things and that why i kept my guide simple. Guide contains several methods how to card hotels around the world. Most important part in guide is links that allow you easly card hotels with maximum security. Price for tutorial for now is 50$ , it may go up and may go down. For now it will be 50$. Most of people can't card hotels because most hotels don't accept payments online , they just reserve booking and you have to pay at hotel when you arrive or you have to leave creditcard at receptiontill checkout. Avoid that. Use my guide! Make surprise for your girlfriend or potential girlfriend with night in hotel for 800$ ! Potential in this is for carders also , who have problems carding things. You know what the problem ? Your setup. Socks5 + VPN is carding killing machine. Socks5 is just a mask , and most of sites nowadays detect that mask and doesnt allow to checkout. I found out that when i tryed to purchase something from my work (legaly) my work is masking IP and i could'nt checkout.So with my hotel method you can just go to hotel with your laptop and card from there to avoid that retarded declines because of masked IP. Infact you can start your service providing hotels at 50% of hotel price or whatever. http://www.k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/9330

Those companies are then obligated to comply and provide supportive information to find the perpetrator.  They print the ID/Passport at check-in and store it for up to 1-3 years, depending on location. Video surveillance in the reception and (lobby?) is stored for 1+ years, depending on location.  No it's never safe to use credit card fraud.","SniperFox wrote:Had a chance to take a look at this guide and the information is good. With regards to this being ""high risk"", as long as you are using 3rd parties to make bookings, the hotels only see guest name, not cardholder name. If you are worried use fake ID. Any chargebacks will be made to the 3rd party, not the hotel directly. Any chargebacks will be put through insurance and unlikely be chased up. If the booking is cancelled the hotel will not know the reason why, they will only see the cancellation.I am not saying this is 100% safe but 3rd party travel agents receive fraudulent transactions daily, it's cheaper and easier for them to write off the money and claim through insurance than keep chasing small time carders."

you need massive RAM to load that piece of shit and all the other crap it drags along with it. if you have a Win8 box, you need to go in the BIOS and turn off fast boot and enable the legacy BIOS, then load some version of linux. it doesn't matter which one because you are going to run VM on top of it anyway. at least then you will have enough RAM to do something.","mikaeldunknow wrote:popadoppalus wrote:ccleaner is far from foolproof. if you you use it's full features, it's like driving a MAC truck through your system and leaves a path that even the most inexperienced forensic investigator can follow. it certainly won't hurt you to do things like spoof the MAC and change the s/n on HDD (maybe even the mouse) but since you are programming an alternative to netflix, then you must know that on a windows system there are many APIs that can accomplish the same task, so while you may spoof your hard drive S/N by changing a value in the registry, an adversary (in the extremely unlike event he was even concerned) could read the S/N directly from the metal. cookies are a big issue and you are prudent to be concerned, but i think it would be wise for many here to study up on browser fingerprinting, as none of your tactics have addressed that or RAM analysis.

My friend has a product that he wishes to sell on a deep web market soon.  However he is very worried about security. On his belhalf I have searched for "" secuirty "" on this forum, I remember Silk Road had a good secuirty thread but since thats shut down I can no longer access this info of course. Here are the areas of intrest I wish to learn about.  IP addreses.   Do vendors sell from their own homes, ussing a VPN + tor.  Is this considered a good enough protection.  I have read, in simple terms, that tor works by re-routing your computer through a series of proxy servers, and that police can offer their services as a proxy and thus gain access to the original IP address info.Is this true, is it realisticlly going to happen, would a VPN protect me against this.  What alternatives does my friend have from *working from home.  Fingerprints seem an obvious route that LE catch a suspect, wearing gloves when handling illegal items to posted out seems a good idea, but what about DNA........  Will well washed gloves and a bit of carefullness protect from contaminating your illegal goods with DNA.  I have looked up about destroying DNA, but sprays etc are very expensive. What other ideas do people have for stoping your DNA geting on your illegal wares. Drug dealers sell drugs all year round locally, but never get caught, not because the police do not know what they are doing but because........( I conclude ) they do not have "" reasonable cause "" to investigate.  What constitutes being resonable cause?  Is DNA alone enough?  are fingerprints alone enough? Finally selling to police - there is no doubt that police operate in these deepweb markets, perhaps even owning one or two, fingerprints and DNA do not matter if youre not going to accedentally sell to the police, how can my friend NOT sell to the police?  By requiring a minimum of 10 previous buys from the customer. Posting - Whenever I recieve mail from vendors from the deep web (or indeed anywhere) there is always a stamp......is it called being "" franked "".......that tells me where, aproximately the mail was sent from.  Do people then travel to post their goods out?  How far should one travel.....ussing random post boxes seems a good (and obvious) idea, are there any other ideas that help this to NOT be a point of comprimise for the secuirty of vendor.  I can see that people have been doing this for a long time without any police intervention, and my friend wishes to follow in their footsteps  Is there anywhere I can go to read up more.",""

Only going to be selling 3 copies. $200 each. This is only because I'm currently working this myself and 3 others doing this shouldn't burn the method. Just finalizing the last final few stages and correcting some of the wording.  If you'd be interested in being one of the lucky 3 let us know. If you don't have $200 currently to your name please keep on scrolling. As much as I'd like to help you earn money I'm only here to help those serious enough. You can't do this without some start up cash. This is new and if I see Fake selling this in a couple of weeks I will find out which one of you sold the method on and hunt you and your family down. The cash out for this is limited to how much you have to spend on the necessary goods which can all be purchased here or on ebay. You can easily build this up to the point of earning large amounts. Pay out is every 16 days. Although I will be providing other options with this guide for you to look at and see which one suits you. This cash out is only suited to those who have the ability or access to someone who can create a basic website. Website building instructions are not included in this guide. Mods come at me if you want to be the one to vouch I will send you the guide tomorrow or Sunday. Looking at you guys in particular: themostseekrit or Sniperfox.",""

Before listing my products on EVO I need to know how to package and ship out 112 grams of cannabis using USPS drop box. Here are my questions: Should I acquire a prepaid card (with someone's fullz) and purchase online prepaid flat rate shipping labels to ship?  OR  Should I purchase stamps at a post office and use padded envelopes?  What I find very difficult with option 1 is there's no flat rate box that can fit 4 oz of weed. The small flat rate box is too small. And the medium is too big and cannot fit the blue drop box.  In option 2 there's the padded envelopes but how much stamps should I use to ship 4 oz? I also read that there's a restriction on thickness of envelope? Also, does it matter what size envelope I use?  If anyone can help share their input I would greatly appreciate it very much. Thanks in advance. Cheers",""

If I ever received a qp inside of a multiple layer vac seal I'd be extremely upset and very paranoid that my postal may know what's up from that point in time forward. Only mbb is sufficient for shipping marijuana. My favorite bud vendor (USdank) ships with multiple layers of vac + MBB.  Smell seaps through vac in a matter of like 14 hours (multiple layers). USE MBB! And at least 1 layer of vac inside the mbb. And use common sense please. As in, don't use the same gloves to touch the bud as you do to package it or to touch packaging materials. I'd suggest keeping your empty priority boxes in a different room than the bud so that it won't absorb the smell of the bud. Don't get high while packaging, etc. Just be smart and follow the above and you'll be okay. Also, ONLY USE USPS! If you use fedex or ups consider yourself busted. 3rd party shippers don't need a warrant to open your package, USPS does! ONLY USE USPS! Good day sir and I hope I've helped.",""

"Evolution Forums","Shyahz","51130","2015-02-27T20:44:26","Re: Need help how to ship 4 oz of weed","Security & Anonymity","Yes negative feedback would be due, as I'm sure a k9 can smell what I can't. And it's a well known fact that the smell seaps through vac in a very short period of time, so even 5 layers isn't going to hold up long enough for your package to arrive. MBB on the other hand holds up for very long periods of time while remaining entirely smell proof, even if smelled by a k9. And yes, any intelligent and professional weed vendor knows to dip the mbb into alcohol and letting it dry before putting it into the package. And I am not incorrect about it being super hot on the plane. If you've been around since sr1 than I'm sure you're quite familiar with the pinned topic with a step by step explanation of the process your package goes through when being shipped via usps. It was written by a former postal worker, and he specifically mentioned that on the plane especially in the summer it gets very warm and he himself had smelled packages that were clearly bud. Heat causes Molecules to expand.

(http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=27.0)I didn't see so much topic about how to install Tails so I suppose for some Newbies, it can be somehow helpful.CAUTION: Tails alone is not enough to protect everything. Try to do more research about security if you want to have a maximum protection (VPN, for example). Tutorial Part 1 - How to install Tails onto a USB drive.------------------------------------------------------------------- Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux. Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked. Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis."" You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere. 1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key 2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ 3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer    3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer    3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)    3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)    3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)    3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least. 4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive)  Booting from a USB drive:-------------------------------------If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue. Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar).(Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/ For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can readhttp://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read thishttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/  Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You may want to print this text out on paper for easier reference. 5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional. 7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.     7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""         7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)         7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.     8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required. 9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)     9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!"" characters   )         9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.         9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.     10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.     11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).     Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)   If you want to install Tails but you only have one USB Thumb drive here is what you have to do: 1) Download latest tails iso from: https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso4) Insert a USB flash drive5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer7) Click ""Clone & Install""8) Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written9) Click ""Create Live USB""10) Click ""Next""11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK""

"Evolution Forums","strace","1679","2014-02-06T00:33:10","Re: Couple of question","Security & Anonymity","1. Kali is not a distro geared around anonymity/privacy. It's based on backtrack and its focus is on offensive security/pen testing/hacking/pwning/exploiting shit. So if you don't know what you're doing then no, it wasn't designed for the layman in mind. If you do know what you're doing you could customize it to be as secure as tails, but there's no out of the box solution you could download and install that would give you that level of anonymity because it runs contrary to what kali was designed for. Locking it down like that be a hindrance by limiting the scope of your attack matrix if you could only get online via anonymizing protocols. 2. If you're using a live distro without persistence, there are no traces of anything outside volatile ram anyway, which is gone within seconds of powering off. If you're using with persistence then no because the whole point of persistence is being able to retain work between reboots. 3. Why not? Haven't looked specifically at the eraser code, but seeing how you could just fill the file up with 1's and 0's using a tool as simple as dd to effectively wipe it I can't think of a reason why eraser couldn't be equally effective.  4. Encrypted Drive -> VM  -> TOR -> VPN -> Socks5You just have to be willing to put up with the major latency issues you'll suffer.A preferable way is to use an anonymous mobile hotspot from home. It'd be a latency improvement. 5. wh0a ... different topic maybe you should start a separate thread asking that.","Secilon wrote:Here's my questions: 1. Is Kali a safe alternative to Tails? 2.

Paranoia is a good thing and the steps you've taken are all good, but since you mentioned that the above is ""the last thing that you can think of"" am I correct to assume that you haven't implemented this (tails/linux) yet? If so, I hope that you are NOT using any version of Windows. Windows security is an oxymoron. Windows is a joke. But I digress. Here's the thing though, there are two points of exposure and risk that all buyers are subject to regardless of what measures you take to hide your identity: (1) vendors need an address (2) the goods need to be delivered to it.  #1: All you can do is pgp your address and hope that the vendor does some some dumb sh*t like have your address on an unencrypted computer or otherwise accessible by LE (ask vendors about this, they shouldn't keep this info after shipping). #2: If someone shows up at your door asking you to sign a package that you were not expecting (Amazon, etc) or you are not 100% sure is clean do not sign, accept, or otherwise say sh*t to them. Keep your effing mouth shut and close the door. I guess the point is that no matter what measures you take it is impossible to be 100% risk free. All you can do is mitigate the risk, not eliminate it. That is life.

As Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) were adopted, only one port was needed. The even numbered ports were dropped. This is why some even numbers in the well-known port number range are unassigned. TCP and UDP port numbers are also used for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). SCTP and DCCP services usually use a port number that matches the service of the corresponding TCP or UDP implementation if they exist. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers for specific uses. However, many unofficial uses of both well-known and registered port numbers occur in practice.     now as i mentioned Port 53 sends the DNS request. If you are on TOR you don't need to worry about DNS because TOR services don't use IP addresses. However if block this port you won't be able to access anything on the clear web because there will be no DNS server available to resolve the host names. (you could still get there by typing the actual IP) also the UDP DNS request is the only time that your MAC is sent anywhere. i suppose in theory someone could write an exploit that used port 53, but that is true of any port. Port 80 is for HTML traffic. you can block that and only access web sites that use other ports. that's non-standard, but could be useful in some cases. there's tons of documentation on the clear web.    an interesting exercise: open a DOS (CMD) window and type the netstat command (you can use help to get optional command line parameters  --- netstat /?) it will show you all your open ports and what they are doing. sorta what they are doing - you need a sniffer to see the actual traffic.",""

As far as OTR goes, I saw Jake and Roger talk at CCC in December where they revealed that NSA could not crack OTR. This was based on documents that are now a few years old (please correct me if I am wrong), so it is anyone's guess what has happened since. Some of the more worrying attacks depend on physical access to your machine, so its physical security is always important Do what you can, stick to your OPSEC procedures and do not deviate, no matter how tempting it might be to save a few seconds by cutting corners. EDIT: Afterthought - 3072 or 4096 keys should always be used. Anything less than this is inviting trouble (so I have heard) which means, when will we see VPN providers providing something more heavy-duty than RSA-AES256-SHA, 2048 bit RSA? Interesting.

Following the purchase of a new IBM Thinkpad Keyboard from Amazon.com, Shepard discovered her package to be taking a strange detour to the East Coast, revealed by a screenshot of her shipment tracking information.     Youâd think #NSA shipment âinterdictionâ would be more subtleâ¦ pic.twitter.com/KVCscLbdgG     â Andrea (@puellavulnerata) January 24, 2014 Instead of shipping straight towards Seattle from the Amazon storage warehouse in Santa Ana, California, Shepardâs package made its way clear across the country to Dulles, Virginia. Jumping around an area deep inside what some privacy experts refer to as Americaâs âmilitary and intelligence belt,â the package was finally delivered to its new endpoint in Alexandria. While not uncommon to see packages sent to major shipping hubs in different areas of the country, the âout for deliveryâ and successful âdeliveredâ statuses clearly indicate the itemâs final destination was changed without Shepardâs approval, leading privacy experts to take notice. âCould Amazon have made a mistake in notifying Shepard about this extra journey, which was likely meant to stay a secret?â PrivacySOS asks. âIf this really is an example of the TAO laptop-interception program in action, does this mean that companies like Amazon are made aware of the governmentâs intention to âlook afterâ consumer products ordered by their customers? Or did Shepard receive this weird notice only after some sort of glitch in the NSAâs surveillance matrix?â According to recently revealed internal NSA documents, the agencyâs Office of Tailored Access Operations group, or TAO, is responsible for intercepting shipping deliveries of high-interest targets. âIf a target person, agency or company orders a new computer or related accessories, for example, TAO can divert the shipping delivery to its own secret workshops,â Der Speigel noted last month. âAt these so-called âload stations,â agents carefully open the package in order to load malware onto the electronics, or even install hardware components that can provide backdoor access for the intelligence agencies.â Given the NSAâs deep interest in Tor, a popular online anonymity tool, some speculate Shepardâs keyboard could likely have been implanted with a TAO bug known as âSURLYSPAWN,â a small keylogging chip implanted in a keyboardâs cabling. According to NSA slides, a bugged keyboard can be monitored even when a computer is offline. âIf it ever shows, Iâll be inspecting it as closely as Iâm capable of,â Shepard said on Twitter. Other leaked documents have revealed the NSAâs repeated attempts at identifying users of Tor, which according to the agencyâs âTor Stinksâ presentation has only received minor success at best. âWe will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time,â the presentation states. âWith manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users.â Whether Shepardâs incident was the result of a simple error by Amazon, an NSA interception, or an act of intimidation is still unclear. Given the governmentâs history of targeting Jacob Appelbaum, Torâs main advocate, the idea of a top Tor developer being singled out for advanced NSA surveillance is far from unlikely.Share Button

In the second method its cashing out cc which needs fullz for bank. Can also be used to cashout cc to btc with a secret method I will share to first buyer. The third method is just a way of making money from btc without localbitcoin/coinbase etc.

If LE only had a copy of the encrypted address info on the vendors computer, the sender wouldn't be known short of some rubber hose crypto or similiar.

Yeah , me too!! Finally i found answers for these complicated questions. I was doing research to answer on these questions so long , every day , before sleep and after wake up.Now i can provide GUIDE how to card these major sites.With my method you can card items to your house , without having problems getting drops. You can even chose any name for delivery. [i wont recommend it , but it works]Method is tested couple weeks ago and it works perfectly. Only reason why i provide method just now is because i didn't want method to get burnt since i wanna card the shit out of it before it dies. Also i had to recive items before claim that method is working. Method now is for 250$ AND it will be sold to ONLY to 2 guys.Simply price is high because you will get money back with first order. Price is high also because i want to sell it only to 2 people and i don't want this method to travel from friend to friend.I want this method working as long as possible. I haven't leaked this method to anyone , even to friends who helped me before. This is business and this is money. Also i will add UK amazon gift card method to this guide aswell as soon as amazon will answer to my emails and i will successfully test it and confirm that its working. http://www.k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/9975 questions ? before FRIM and Maaaaadcity arrives to this thread - fuck off. No money no honey. +Bonus i will give 3 UK websites where you can card electronics. Sites are non-vbv and ship/bill. UPDATE: WAITING FOR SOME CONFITMATIONS FROM AMAZON. WILL RELEASE THIS RIGHT AFTER I WILL GET EMAIL FROM AMAZON.

First time jitters I guess being new to bitcoin and linux. Part of me wants to be lazy and use my Windows machine as a host, then use VPN + Tor. The other side of me says, go ahead and use Windows as Host, but use Whonix as Guest VM. And then my other-other side says, ditch the idea of using a VM and get burner laptop, install OpenBSD and run VPN + Tor.  Gets really easy to want to keep upping up the security., but i'm of the thought that if  security is to complex, human errors will screw you over.  Anyway, whats' your thought on anonymous bitcoin wallets? Do you use VPN + Tor and browse to Blockchain / bitaddress and create an online wallet or do you stick with offline wallets (e.g. electrum, multi-bit), etc? I'm trying to come up with a plan to have a dozen burner wallets that I can trickle funds to. Once my monies are sperated to my likeing I can slowly add money to Evo wallet. But like with the above, I'm trying to strike that balance of being extra-caution and being realistic and not overfly complex that I introduce level 8 errors.",""

This means that customers may use the vulnerability whatever way they like, possibly for de-anonymizing anyone the government considers a target. Exodus Intel plans to tell The Tails creators about the issues duly but no timeline has been disclosed yet. The security flaw reports hit Tails at a very bad time as it has just released version 1.1. Tails OS promises privacy by running all traffic through Tor, the network that routes your traffic through different layers of servers and encrypts it to ensure privacy. Tails is designed to be stored on a flash drive, so that users could easily remove it and leave no trace on their computers. However recent exploit found by Exodus might undo many security promises of this software, which was praised by Snowden a lot. âThese flaws are in the 1.0.1 version of Tails and it allows to exploit a targeted user both for remote code execution and de-anonymization,â Loc Nguyen, a researcher at Exodus said. Remote code execution means that a hacker can install malware on victimâs system, draw off files from it, basically do whatever he likes with victimâs computer. âConsidering the purpose of Tails which is to provide a completely secured non-attributable platform, users are at risk due to these flaws. Tails was created in order to increase privacy by maintaining privacy and making sure user communications and actions will not be attributable. Hence any violation of these pillars can be considered as highly critical,â Nguyen added.",""

"Evolution Forums","Q_BlackWidow","14219","2014-07-29T19:40:57","Re: Which VPNs Do You Recommend?","Security & Anonymity","I am currently using Nord VPN. (www.nordvpn.com/). Found them while digging through many many VPN services and trying them out one by one.  Before Nord VPN I was using Private Internet Access which were a very good service. I just thought I could find better and more secure. I even used AIR VPN at one point but didn't like a few things about it. I even used Proxy.sh (www.proxy.sh) VPN services along with their proxy. I found the OS X client a bit buggy but other than that, they are a close second in my opinion. Their Proxy services worked well using a Proxifier to connect. It was stable and quite fast. Proxy.sh are based in Mahe which is a distant offshore island not under the umbrella of current US laws. Another one I tried was Ibvpn (www.ibvpn.com/) which is the ONLY VPN provider to utilize SSTP for Mac OS X computers. SSTP is a next generation VPN protocol, in theory, only for Windows and Linux clients but they managed to get it working on a Mac OS X machine. I have poured over the details of many service providers but they are the first to accomplish this feat.  I would typically stay away from Golden Frog and other large VPN providers (HideMyAss come to mind) because they typically keep logs.  Back to Nord VPN. Without a doubt, these guys know what they are doing. I am running Mac OS X 10.9.2 with Tunnelblick 3.4beta32. The config files to connect to the VPN are one of a kind. For example, they implement a connection called Double VPN. ""Double VPN is a security solution when the data is encrypted twice through multi-node farm. The encryption is double AES-256-CBC."" The user connects to the first node where the data is encrypted. Then the encrypted data flows to the second node and gets encrypted again and only then reaches the internet. At the moment they have only combination of Austria -> Netherlands nodes available for double VPN.  Pretty cool stuff. Highly secure. The data is encrypted to 2048 Bits and they DO NOT keep logs of any kind.  Some of the features of Nord VPN are: -Up to 1Gbps connection-No traffic logs-Unlimited bandwidth-Anonymous IP address-Secure server locations  What takes the cake for me is their TOR VPN connection. That's right, I can connect to the TOR network without opening the TOR Bundle Software essentially giving my OS full reigns of the TOR network. Of course I don't torrent over it or use SoulSeek. So when I actually do open the TOR Bundle Application, it is already connected to the TOR network, therefore making the connection that much more secure by bouncing across even more nodes. After becoming soooooo happy with their service, which is dirt cheap, I bought a 1 year subscription which costs me 48 euros. This comes down to 4 euros per month. I think I got a month free as well. I would like everyone to know that this provider took me a lot of digging around and I was truly surprised by the amount of features this provider has. They are a small VPN company but definitely powerful nonetheless.  No I don't work for Nord VPN. I am just an extremely paranoid user who seems to have found the holy grail of VPNs.

After all they monitor file sharing and bit-torrent activity and regularly send notices to customers telling them to cease and desist downloading copyrighted material. it strikes me as only prudent to shield yourself from prying eyes. if they are seeing you using TOR (which is legal) they may alert some bored local LE and you might get a knock on your door asking to peek at your hard drive. also on the other hand if you use VPN to surf clearweb ISP has no logs of what sites you visited. it's a pain in the ass for them to get warrant for VPN logs.","frapedaki12 wrote:what if you card 2 VPN's and using a setup like this: Tor-->1st VPN-->VM ware(Whonix)--> 2nd VPN-->VIP72???? is there a possibility to receive a chargeback for low amounts like that??"

This method is written personally by me. It involves physical work, this is not for people who are strictly to the digital carding/scheming etc.You will have to get your hands dirty, but trust me it is worth it.So if you don't consider physical schemes profitable than this is not for you.  What is this method about,really..?All I can say for this matter is that it involves some paper work, some time and patience. Through the course of this method you will learn how to scam insurance companies and take as much $ as you can.All LEGALLY! I will stress this out there is nothing illegal that you are going to do (at least not at the end of everything). Our goal is everything to look legit in the end.  What will I need to start doing this? You will need some type of a transport vehicle - car, motorcycle etc. The next thing that you are going to need are about 200-300 euro (this is relative, you will probably do fine with a lot less).And last a lot of patience. If you are lazy, this is not for you. If you are not lazy , than I am sure this will be very fun for you to do.  Does this work all over the world? I can confirm this works in the EU. Outside of EU , I have no idea. Hence I will be giving a US member and an EU member on evo a vouch copy.  So , who can get a vouch copy? If you are a good rep member of the forums/market then PM here. Only 2 vouches will be given to a US member and an EU member.  How much profit can I make from doing this?With this particular scheme the sky is your limit. Although if you are a total newbie to the scene or a retard I suggest you do not buy this method.  Will this get burned fast? Technically this method can not get burned Ever. In order to get burned the whole system needs to change, so it's like changing a certain Law in a country.  How much does this method cost? It will cost 60$ for all users. The link to the listing is on top.Why so low/high price you ask? Because basically it can't get burned, but at the same time you can get huge amount of profit doing it.Also the requirements for doing it are a little bit high, so that too affects the price of the method. For the price of $60 I am both making it available for the masses of people on here , but also limiting the availability to kids who want to buy a bullet proof method for $$ and sit on their asses waiting for the money to flow, this is not how it works.   So bottom line. If you want to make money and you are ready to get out and start doing business then this IS for you. And if you are a kid who wants to sit on their ass all day while dreaming about the $, It is not for you.  I also have a ToS, which anyone who buy's my method should follow(this is in result of my previous method that I wrote): 1.You should not Dispute,once the method has been sent. It is a working method. It is tested. It is being done everyday as we speak In Spain & Italy the most! I do not take responsibility if you are an asshole who fails at whatever you take upon doing.2.Under no circumstances you will resell my method.3.Don't expect me to shove the money in your face. I am simply telling you how to do step by step what I have done , and many others have before and still are.That being said no refunds are given. P.S. I know I give you limited information about the method, but I think what I have said until now is more than enough.  For those of you who receive my vouch/review or buy their own copy I will be glad to assist you with any questions you got.For those who wish to receive a vouch/review copy PM me with the area you are located: US or EU. Thank you and good luck!

Now that you posted the link I checked it out and that looks pretty nifty. Would using this pretty much be as safe as PGP? Considering the messages being seen in case of LE seizing the server that hosts privnote doesn't really apply here since they self-destruct upon the first viewing (I'm assuming that nothing gets stored on the server). And honestly, even if they did seize the server, as long as you were smart with your messages, they couldn't really tie you to anything. Like as long as you didn't send a message saying ""here's my address for the 1000 kg of cocaine"", they wouldn't be able to tie that message with a transaction for something illicit on EVO. As far as they're concerned, someone at ""so and so"" address sent that address as encrypted information on privnote and that's about it.","BabyBlue wrote:DarkBear wrote:You guys privnote.com at all?Also the mods here are the best, never had a problem with sensitive data, however you should be as careful as possible.I use sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion when I have to send sensitive information on the forum.I agree, the staff does an amazing job.

Its just so easy to use these websites, plus if its just an address that gets pulled from Priv. There's not a real connection to the crime. Also the self destruct thing. Course if they don't use solid state drives with trim, they wont experience data evaporation. Maybe the data is constantly over written as well.

I guess this is where the stealth offered by the vendor comes into the equation, but the fact remains that the vendor would still require real address info. Some vendors may be trustworthy but could other less trustworthy vendors use this information against us?

When i open up Ubuntu that way, it goes through the installation process, but only gives the option to install to the hardall drive. I'm guessing because to install to the pen would mean erasing the installation files? ( Same way you can't install windows from your hard drive) Maybe i have to install from USB to USB? Only i don't have more than one to hand ATM. So surely there is a way to do this from hard drive to USB?

If i wanted to install ubuntu to an external HD. And my main machine was windows, what i would do is get your ubuntu bootable usb. Plug that into your main machine aswel as external hard drive, boot up ubuntu from usb. Once booted click install ubuntu on desktop ( i think ). Once that opens it should ask you the drive letter you wish to install to ( external drive ). Aswel as if you would like a seperate partition to install along side your current operating system. Once you have done this you will have Your main machine as normal how its been from the start. A usb with a bootable version of ubuntu. And an external HD with ubuntu ( im not sure how this boots as im unsure how it installs from the desktop ) I havnt done to many ubuntu installations in my time especially not to an external HD with the method your using.

For people from OZ","Security & Anonymity","Hey peeps So I ordered 8grams of MDMA off a seller I personally had never ordered from before - but they had level 4 feedback with only 1 neutral feedback and zero negative, so I thought I'd be fine Anyway, the express envelope arrived torn open and sealed back with absolutely no attempt to hide it had been opened. It was completely empty. There was no way it was taken by someone else getting to it at the letterbox first, as I was there when the postie delivered it so was first to lay hands on it. So my question is this - who has the drugs? When I disputed the escrow payment, the vendor said I was just trying to extort money off them. And to be honest, I can understand that perspective - ""Help the envelope was empty"" screams ""I want free drugs"". But the fact is, at some point the drugs were taken out of the envelope. What I want to know is, does it seem like maybe the vendor screwed me? Or if the parcel was intercepted at AusPost, how would they know? I'm pretty careful with my online usage. And it's been a week now so I would think if law enforcement was coming they would have by now - and I realise that sounds a little paranoid and I'm a small fry user...

If LE investigates and they get copy of the ID on file for the box, they can just compare to local state or national database and you're screwed?  well i don't know what country you are in, but i guess whether or not it is wise or not depends on your intentions, besides they don't take a picture when you open a po box. they don't copy your ID and put it on file at least not in US. now this facial recognition software stuff is pretty scary especially since they arrested recently a 30 year fugitive by scanning the database of FLA driver's license pix. the scary part was that the only pic they had of the guy was over 30 years old. but that was US Marshall;s service and one of their main jobs is to track fugitives. most local LE don't have access to that type of technology. all 95% can do is call in a license plate to see if they are at the right address. but you are correct to worry about that other 5%. i would suggest photoshop on your fake id. you need to study up on facial recognition software and how it works in order to determine how to alter your appearance. fake ids are a whole world unto themselves. i remember the days when people printed the SSNs on their checks. i knew some guys that would steal checkbooks and go down to DMV and use them as ID to get a drivers license with their picture and the other guys identity. then they would go all over town bouncing checks. they never got busted for that, but did go down on drug charges. the thing i never could figure is that a pic on file with DMV - which seemed to me would make it easy for detectives. maybe you only need to worry about 1%. when i was young, long, long ago i used to make fake IDs, but that was before they had pictures - but it was also before they had computers and color laser printers and photoshop.",""

Google scares the hell out of me - much worse than the NSA.

If you haven't got the brain cells to properly read my posts and method, you're only going to dig yourself a hole. Sadly, you've already dug that hole and dolphin dived into it. '$4000 A WEEK' is not '$4000 IN YOUR FIRST WEEK'. As clearly stated in my method, $300 is a recommended starting point to become familiar with the process and stripes behavior. If you want to dive straight into it with $4,000, go ahead, my words do not limit the method potential.  The method stated that the real skill is in understanding the reactions and obstructions that Stripe's anti-fraud system may inflict. If you don't have the capabilities to follow a basic security set up to create the impression of organic transactions, that is not my fault. Not only have I reached all the claimed assumptions, but speaking on asfr's behalf he has reached the same level of revenue, if not higher, using his slight twist of my method. Every method takes practice, skill and learning to be totally manipulated, if you think otherwise I recommend steering clear of purchasing any more methods.  What account are you on about? If the bank account is closed then it's because you're either trying to clear $50k+ in a short amount of time or you lack the basic set up needed to not set off any alarms when using your bank account. CCs cost $6, are you joking?  Ok, now I get your motive. Slip back into your umbro tracksuit and scooter the fuck off this forum.  In regards to that quote, read over my reply. I was in question of just how he's integrating the illusion of organic payments while maintaining a majority automatic system. I DID provide influence as to how to create these organic payments. I provided not only the security set up, but indication as to why stripe will close your account as well as stating that the real skill is in becoming familiar with stripes system, so that it can be correctly manipulated. That cannot be taught.  Objection, no relevance.  If anything, that vouches for the method. It wouldn't be worth leaking otherwise.  80% of the stated arguments could have been addressed by myself and overcome through support. From what you've said, it's clear that you're lacking funds and expect this guide to make you millions with minimal effort, if i'm correct, I can only cringe. A 7 day wait is not long, using the right cards (as addressed in my method) this has no relevance whatsoever and can be easily overcome.  What twat whines about a claimed working method in public before addressing the vendor at least once? Get the fuck out of here.

"Evolution Forums","thepentacodon","10358","2014-05-17T16:38:05","[ TUTORIAL ] Maintain Your Anonymity Online.","Security & Anonymity","Safety is the key. No one wants to give the federals the satisfaction of busting us and shutting down production, so we gotta stay as anonymous as possible. First let me start off by saying there's no 100% safe way to card. Don't let people fool you into thinking that. You can be behind all the proxies, wingates, socks, and whatever else in the world, but you leave ""digital fingerprints"" wherever you go. For my personal benefits, I use a carded ISP combined with an anonymizer account (www.anonymizer.com) and a level 1 proxy. But I don't recommend that for everyone. NOTE: Before we start, I must mention that these are the extras one can use to increase their anonymity online. Don't forget to use Tor, VirtualBox, Socks5 proxies etc. first. > www.anonymizer.com: offers excellent services for those that want to remain anonymous. The setback is that its a service, and like any other service provided, you have to pay for usage and they will restrict your account due to fraudulent usage. Just card another one rite? If you're planning to use anonymizer, just concentrate on keeping your IP secret from their services instead of the site you're carding. The only set-back to the service is that they have some issues with sites using Java Applets, meaning you might have to skip out on some major sites that require JAVA. >  Proxies and such: I use private hidden proxies, and don't really **** with any other proxies, so I can't comment too much on this topic. As far as I'm told, proxies differ from level 1 to level 3, 1 being the most anonymous, 3 being the least. You can also get free proxies from www.anonymitycheker.com/page1.htm this is a decent site which ranks their proxies from ""transparent"" (leaks your IP) to ""highly anonymous."" they also do real-time proxy tests and other ****. >  Stealther: There's a software out there that will actually link your proxies together for maximum anonymity. This software is called Stealther. Stealther can be registered via a key (so you can go to #serialz on efnet and get a key) and is a decent anonymity-software. > EvidenceEliminator: If you're really serious about carding, this is a program you NEED to have installed on your HDD all the time. Federal agents have several softwares that allow them to extract information from your PC, such as the pages you have visited, the files you have deleted, and the emails you have written. Every time your PC restarts, this software kicks in, providing you with the safety of erasing any tell-tale logs and history files. You always want to be prepared for the worse. >  JAVA: Regardless of what stealth method you are using, always be sure to disable JAVA on your browser. Just Google it for more information. >  CARDED ISPs: I'm not sure if carding an ISP is safe or not. I've heard mixed feed-backs about this idea. However, I can testify that I've had experience with such a matter and I haven't had a problem as of yet. Some popular ISPs to card are Earthlink Pre-paid (you can pre-pay it up to a year, look for the link on their confusing website) and America Online (better used for a quickie card, just get out one of their 849308490383904 free 10000000 hour cds and input a few CCs into that *****) These aren't the only stealth methods out there. These are just the popular ones at the moment. If you feel you have an anonymity method that works, by all means try it out, and post it here. You never know what works and what doesn't until you experiment with it. Also, if you need to know how anonymous you really are, there are some simple ways of testing this. >  www.whatismyip.com: the first (and most basic) test you should take. whatismyip.com is a simple method of knowing what your IP is on the web. This does not run though JAVA so you cant really tell if your anonymous or not from this site alone. >  http://www.sinfulcherries.com/?aid=525390: This is actually a pr0n site protected by ibill. When you try to sign-up, there is a java applet that tells you ""your current IP of blah blah blah is being recorded. Any fraudulent blah blah blah will be reported."" If its not your real IP, you p***ed the second test. (you can also check your CCs here) >  http://www.multiproxy.org/env_check.htm: this is a basic check of your anonymity level. Must have JAVA enabled -- the true purpose of the site is to promote their software (multiproxy) which works in similar fashion to Stealther.  Stay Anonymous. Stay Safe.

In any event this went back to 2009. so far there have been 10 or 11 guilty pleas. all got $100K fines and are still in business. there are still 4 or 5 more cases that are sealed, but there is no reason to believe they will get any worse than the others. however as i mentioned i did computer work for these guys, configuring stuff, little shit. well after they got busted (homeland security no less) they wanted me to show them how to cover their tracks. so i went out and bought windows 8 laptop for testing (already had everything up til then) and coded a whole suite of routines similar to cCleaner. that is a very good product, btw, but it uses brute force so it leaves its own special footprint. my routines were much more interactive. for example, you could pull up a list of all your searches (google or whatever) and then you had the ability to delete the ones you didn't want (like that one for cyanide) and keep the others. likewise for other stuff. actually i wrote a whole set of file handling routines, let you find duplicate files, consolidate them in a single dir, search by extension, keyword, etc. etc. but one extra feature was that if you deleted a file, that disk space got overwritten 10 times - so it couldn't be recovered (at least not without an electron microscope). so that stopped the need to periodically wipe your unallocated space - as anyone who has done it knows - it takes hours. it is much easier to do it as you you go. fuck a recycle bin. but as i mentioned these guys were gamblers not sharp computer guys so they wanted a way to go to their online casino, make their bet and leave no trace. so i worked on a dead open source project called DSL (damn small linux) it was 32 K and had Firefox embedded in it. the idea was they could run it from a stick or even install it or boot from it  and have it delete tracks on exit. we aren't talking national security here. so i was all set - had web domain and server, etc. and was going to release a package on the clear web. but the shit hit the fan with Snowden and then SR and then FH and who knows what's next and blew everything out of the water. so now i have a very fragmented set of routines (designed for gamblers, but would work for carders) and so far as for PM in case someone has a specific question or problem that i may have the solution to.  if anybody has a specific need, you can post it in the forum and i can answer in the forum if you want to that's your choice. it doesn't matter to me. however, like my signature says (BTW the latin is by Roman poet Juvenal and it means - who watches the watchers - in his context he was applying it to the guys assigned who guarded the emporer's harem - in my case it refers to NSA) but it also says in there  hacking is hardware. i am planning on becoming a vendor and selling kits (may even assembled) that do hacks - like one i described that turns red lights into green - like what they have on ambulances and firetrucks) i also have other hardware stuff, like jammers, antennas, units that fry radar guns (not advised) bug sweepers (some of these gamblers may be computer illiterate but i can assure you they are not criminally inept). i have a ton of stuff you can build that is really cool.i have no agenda other than maybe making a few coins to pay off some medical bills and actually i don't really care about them that much.",""

Whatever you need to ship across border, this guide can tell you how. I decided to write this guide to the best of my knowledge. For those of you who don't know what I can do or don't appreciate my work, never mind. Stealth shipping is an art of its own right. And only knowing how to do it doesn't necessarily make you an expert. But it definitely makes your success rate a lot higher. I tried to make the guides as short and readable as possible so that you'd actually read them. The guides can't cover everything, but it gets you onto the right track, and with some ingenuity, you can figure things out on your own and gain your own experience. This is a series of guides on postal smuggling written by me and Postmaster. Either of us have well over a decade's experience under the belt. This series of guides will cover all the know-hows you need for international stealth shipping. Nobody can guarantee 100% success rate, but this guide is a must-have if you want any success or safety. This complete series will come in 4 guides:  1. ""ABC of Stealth Shipping""It focuses on the basics of stealth shipping/postal smuggling, and is the basis for the following guides. 2. ""Keep Your Cat In The Bag""It will focus on drugs, chemical, explosives, etc. and details on how to beat the dogs. And no, the solution is not Mylar bags. It's something very much cheaper and accessible. And even if you can't get it in your area, there are other alternatives. 3. ""Flexing Your Arms""This is by far the most interesting and significant guide - the holy grail. It's about how to move guns, ammos, weapons, etc. This is definitely the most sophisticated, the most lucrative, and the most fun. Guns and ammo are the most heated targets for every customs in the world. And they are very well trained on spotting them. So it takes some stroke of genius to beat it. But it's definitely possible, and a lot of thrills to do it. 4. ""The Final Resolution""It is about the golden pass called ""Diplomatic Bag"", the ultimate, fail-safe solution. Since it is a fairly difficult trick to pull off, I suspect that it would ever come to use. In fact, in my experience I've never came to any circumstances under which I have to resort to that. I can always beat the customs one way or another. But I'll still write about it in case it may come in handy for you. I would only offer it to those who have bought all guide 1, 2, and 3. I will only sell guide 2 and 3 to those who have purchased or are purchasing alongside guide 1. You'll receive in the guides in pdf. They have my own anti-piracy measures embedded within. If you ever disclose them to the public or disperse it anyhow, it will be traced back to you. The info contained within these guides are very powerful knowledge, and I must be discreet in whom I'm giving it to. I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SALES TO ANYONE WITHOUT EXPLANATION. One last word, sometimes, getting the stuff past customs are only the lowest level of requirements. It's still a long way to go to be the King of Logistics. Just like a lot of the security features used in this community are not impregnable but only too costly and not worth it for the LE to crack, the procedures at customs are also designed to have the same effect. It can never guarantee a 100% block of illegal contraband. But it can raise the cost and complication of smuggling to a level that it is just too much for the business to be lucrative anymore. That's the whole point. And that's where it gets tricky for you - controlling cost and time. That is a higher order beyond getting it moved from point A to point B. And that takes a LOT to work out. fnu

Anybody use this method? Do they open your packages and resend them? Thinking that the invoices might be a problem if all the invoices have different billing addresses, might catch on. All my packages are small so i wonder if i could just have them put all the small packages in one larger box and reship it without them opening the packages. Also, have the mailbox in a city that does not/rarely investigate CC fraud. I know a couple off the top of my head that says right on the police dept website stating THAT WE DO NOT INVESTIGATE CC FRAUD! As long as you keep it under 1,000 a CC and switch up the mailbox's you should stay safe but i still wouldn't press your luck.  I live in the middle of fuckin nowhere and have one mail lady that covers the entire area, she would catch on really quick if i went from drop to drop picking up packages. Lol",""

I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH Yasuo. You will only get an unbiased review from me.  METHOD = âââââ° Plainly awesome. It explains a lot of stuff that newbies and not-so-newbie people will find interesting to read.  It works flawlessly if you pull it out correctly, and he explains everything accordingly. He could've invested some time in explaining more in depth some stuff, specially for newbies, but it's perfectly understandable if you put some effort on investigating on your own. He provides the tools and everything needed to receive and cash out your money, so as long as you're not a lazyass you'll get shit done. ORIGINALITY = ââââ°â° Some of the information is available in other guides from this site, and as I already knew about them, I can't tell it's 100% original. However it is indeed some good information that many newbies will welcome -when I get to know about it, I was extremely surprised and satisfied!-. He however does offer some funny names to his accounts, that's a prop for him   USAGE = âââââ Definitely noob friendly, and a MUST for anyone who wants to get started on Paypal transfers and cashout and knows nothing about it. If you already have knowledge about paypal receiving and cashing out methods, this may be helpful for you and can for sure teach you a lot of stuff and even open some cashout methods you didn't know about. That's my case, for example. Also, the guide is presented on a very clean and understandable manner. I can thumb up for Yasuo for that! He did a good work and I'm sure everyone who have bought this guide can relate with me.  OVERALL = âââââ You'll learn a lot from this guide. You'll learn how to receive funds, how to stealth them, and how to cash them out without getting into troubles. It does, however, require some work, as everything on this life. There's no easy button to obtain trillions of dollars. His famous 'Get 19k$/5 days method'... Yes, it can work. It's currently available for USA -althought I'm 80% sure it can work on other countries too- so I can't test it, but it's plainly easy to understand and I don't see why it would not work. You can do 19k, or you can do 5k, or you can do 30k, as usual, it goes with your work and how much you invest. PROS [â] MUST HAVE for everyone new to Paypal. You'll need no other guide for Paypal if you get this one.[â] Guide is easy to understand.[â] You can easily get ROI in a few days, depend on your hard work.[â] Works worldwide, except -maybe- for the last method.  CONS [â] Require some work. No lazybutts.[â] Require some invest. Not much, I'd say around 100-150$.[â] If you already know A LOT from paypal, you may find this guide not worth the current price. Otherwise, buy it.

I know what the method is and it does work but you will need to do some leg work. Definitely need a drop bank account and some solid CCV's and a good Socks5. I HAVE cashed out using this before nothing over $1000 because I didn't have a drop bank account, but in the method it does tell you how to get one discretely and cash out discretely too, has some good information in it too for other sorts.  I would probably adjust the price a little more to be $100 but that is just me, again this isn't a quick scheme, it takes leg work and time and will work, I am personally just too lazy.

So with this guide you can either set up your own Amazon.com clean sales store (you know, selling clean amazon.com goods at half price and so) or just use it for your own benefit. This method will show how to obtain legal amazon.com gift cards, which according to cabbie, is what he uses to do his service. This guide is quite simple and easy to follow, all it requires is: SocksPaypal middleman account Yeah. That's it. It could also work with CC, but I don't recommend it (as the chargeback will most likely deactivate the card and that would not make it clean), it's up to you to test it or not. Anyone, from everywhere, can do it. But you will need a good middleman account, I don't recommend using a hacked paypal account for the same reason I don't recommend using a CC, chargeback will happen and the card will be deactivated. I believe I'm not missing anything... if you have any questions feel free to PM me here or in EVO marketplace.","Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/5687"

I have verified the image, used brand new dvds, etc etc and still no joy. So I thought I'd buy a USB stick with it pre-loaded in case I was doing something wrong. In order of what happens -- 1) on the ""greeter screen"", if I click Yes on ""further options?"" The desktop loads but nothing else happens, no menus or anything. 2) Then my touchpad won't work, and so getting to anything is a laborious process of tabbing like someone with Parkinsons. 3) There are no network connections recognised. I have tried making a new wired one -- which is really safe and secure, looking at a site about drugs as other people pass me in the hallway -- but NetworkManager resolutely refused to see any of the several wireless networks coming through this house. The last is the biggest problem. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about why NetworkManager fails on Tails when it works on the OS I've got on my main HD.

Xorg settings for your ""mouse"", it should auto-detect but you can set it manually in the config. You might have to resort to a USB mouse or trackball. 3. Look up ndiswrapper. I don't know if Tails comes with it but basically you get the windows driver for your wifi card and load it with ndiswrapper. It only supports WinXP wifi drivers though but you can sometimes finagle it by using older drivers or cards based roughly on the same hardware/chips if a newer non-xp driver is available. My guess is your computer isn't linux compatible very much / very new computer.",""

I tried to follow the TCF Wiki about how to setup Proxychains over Tor, but I think that guide is more oriented on how to use Proxychains in different Linux distros. This is the guide: I have done everything (I bought a Socks5 and put it there instead of ""ip.address.here port"", obviously), but how do I start it? I tried with proxychains tor but it gives me back some errors regarding 127.0.0.1 already in use. What I need to do is:Tails > Tor > Socks5 > Website  I can pay a few bucks for a tutorial, this is not a problem, I'd be very happy to solve this pain in the ass.  Thanks in advance to everyone!","First download & install proxychains:

sudo apt-get install proxychains

Then configure proxychains to setup your chain:

sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf

Down towards the bottom you should see:

[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to ""tor""

Just write your list in using Tor as the first listed:

socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 ip.address.here port

After that you should be done. Just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains:

proxychains firefox -------> (why firefox and not Tor?)"

Am asking because if so the plausible deniability is gone and they will know i lied to them.I could just tell them that i accidentily stepped across this file clicked it and wanted to look what is inside then i realised it is that volume i created half a year ago (Idk if they would believe this   True Crypt is closed source but i don't know any good alternatives for this purpose or if this purpuse is any good at all.I could instead just uzse an old Hard Drive for everything encrypt it and put it always to the rest of my old hardware that i don't use anymore.Still if they really crash into my appartment i would not find the time to do this i think. Also if they find other evidence in my appartment and pass my computer to the data forensics i think they will for sure find the hidden volume so that way is only good if one has a clean appartment impov.",""

RAM analysis can possibly be done for a  short period after the machine is shut down. RAM chips are static and require power but the are still magnetic and retain their magnetic properties for a short period of time. so pulling the plug when they knock on your door may not work. TAILS wipes the RAM on exit. in answer to your original question, if a RAM analysis is performed there may be artifacts of a recent disk access. but more importantly there will be encryption keys stored there. these are the keys that are generated when you type a password. they get stored in RAM because otherwise you would have to enter your password for every disk access. so whether or not you accessed the drive may pale when they have the key to the whole shebang.  BTW a hidden encrypted is stored as a single file, thus leaving a unique fingerprint that belies it's existence. FDE is full disk encryption, where everything is encrypted on the drive. it seems to me that the last time i built a non server Ubuntu box one of the first steps was to opt for FDE. there are also aftermarket solutions to do this. because once you open the drive with the password everyrthing is decrypted. so LE now routinely plans raids at 5:30 AM so they can catch the box running. so if you use FDE you need to shut down your system when not in use. this is why they waited for DPR to boot into his laptop before literally tackling him in SFO library. you can also put a password on the hard drive. but that doesn't encrypt the data.   one other option you have is to use an SD microchip to store sensitive data. it can be swallowed (and presumably recovered later).  but if they are knocking on your door, it's time to hire a lawyer anyway.",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","11486","2014-05-28T14:15:32","european LE digit conference news release","Security & Anonymity","DFRWS Europe 2014 Annual Conference     This article is a recap of some of the main highlights of the Digital Forensics Research Workshop (DFRWS) held in Amsterdam from the 7th â 9th of May; over the next few weeks we will also be bringing you a number of interviews and research updates from the conference. Conference Highlights DFRWS brought together academics and digital forensics practitioners from all over the world to provide an overview of current research and future challenges in the field of computer technology. There was a large amount of research into helping law enforcement officers on the ground; the lack of specialised digital skills within forensics units was a strong talking point throughout the conference. Peter Zinn, the Senior Cybercrime Advisor for the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit, spoke about how the pace of change within digital forensics makes it difficult for law enforcement agents to keep up to date. He highlighted the difficulty with preventing criminals who are predominantly active online, citing two of the main problems as being the general availability of internet access and the concept of the internet having âno bordersâ, making it difficult for cases to be built against web-savvy criminals who work across international borders. Zinn suggested that law enforcement agents could make better use of publicly available or easily accessible data, pointing out that constant web monitoring is expensive and relatively ineffective, and breaking encryption puts everybody at greater risk. However, the amount of data that can be scraped from the open web is not to be underestimated and could probably be used more effectively in criminal investigations. Christian Winter and York Yannikos discussed robust image hashing, specifically the automation of detection of indecent images of children. Whilst several options are currently available, the error rates are too high to allow them to run unattended, meaning that a high level of human interaction is still necessary and the backlog continues to grow. Semi-automated processes such as the prioritisation of images tend to be more effective, and the next step would be working out whether an image is already known. Block hashing is one way of doing this, and this is the teamâs focus at present. The improvement of approximate matching efficiency was put forward as an open research concept, along with the question of whether approximate matching could be used to detect variations of known malware. Interagency communication was another focus of the conference, with several candidates positing this as a way to ease the backlog in criminal investigations. This was one of the main take-aways from the panel discussion on backlogs, which took place on the first day. The volume of digital evidence is constantly expanding and is no longer solely relevant to online crimes. With higher connectivity generally and the proliferation of mobile devices, low-tech and âofflineâ crimes are increasingly requiring a digital component during the investigation. The amount of data is growing exponentially; the number of experts isnât. Several panel members brought up the difference in backlog between law enforcement and the private sector; often the latter have a far shorter backlog in investigation. It was suggested that this may be because private sector companies can turn cases down more easily, whereas police are required to respond to a call for assistance. Triage is one of the main areas that needs to be addressed, as well as up-to-date training for digital forensics experts who are employed by law enforcement agencies. Traditional training structures do not generally apply when it comes to digital investigation, but law enforcement employers are not used to constantly updating their employeesâ training and may be reluctant to do so due to the time and financial outlay required. Frans Kolkman from the Dutch National Police expressed the problem succinctly: âIf you are a company which is drilling holes and selling drills, then your world is probably not what you think. The customer wants holes, he doesnât care about drills. Weâre all talking about digital forensics, but the people weâre working for want to find stuff, they donât care about forensics. We have nice tools and expensive equipment, but at the end of the day they donât care.â Kolkman championed the idea of connecting âreal lifeâ with digital forensics; connecting the police databases with the systems used by digital forensics professionals to extract useful and relevant data, rather than allowing some information to lie dormant. It is often difficult to explain to non-experts how digital evidence is forensically extracted, and how it can back up certain elements of a case. Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm from Bureau Brandijs discussed this problem, adding that it is important to be able to demonstrate that extrapolated data backs up facts rather than theories. Proprietary technology not only makes it more difficult for forensic examiners to extract data, but also for them to explain what the technology is and how it works to a jury made up of members of the general public. Thomas Gloe of Dence Germany discussed the forensic analysis of digital video formats, specifically semantic interpretation, source/author data and whether a video is original or has been altered. Statistical analysis can help to detect traces of manipulation or post-processing, but there are so many video formats available that determining where a file originated and precisely how it has been altered can be very difficult. Europolâs Mikael Lindstroem gave an overview of EC3, the European Cyber Crime Center, and how it is structured. Agencies like Europol can be especially helpful in international investigations where certain countries do not want to send data directly to other places; Europol can comply with each territory's security requirements whilst building an international case. There are a number of challenges that are specific to international cases; for example, Lindstroem spoke about a case in which two law enforcement agents from separate countries were accidentally âgroomingâ each other online; the fact that everyone involved was an agent was not uncovered until the investigation reached a critical point. An international database of current criminal investigations and who the investigators are was posited, but the suggestion was struck down due to the likelihood that it would be hacked. Recent privacy laws across Europe have also hampered some investigations; for example, Europol now do not keep logs of data extracted from paedophile networks due to the questionable ethics of housing and utilising such data. The third day of the conference involved several workshops in which participants were split up into groups and asked to conduct investigations. Kelvin Wong from Hong Kong Police led a âReal Network Forensics Kungfuâ workshop which tackled questions of counterespionage and Skype forensics. The next DFRWS conference will take place in Denver, Colorado from the 3rd â 6th of August 2014. Anyone interested in attending should consult the official website for further details.",""

"Evolution Forums","ebayseller","43326","2015-01-15T15:45:07","FREE Security Guide","Security & Anonymity","Hi all, Found this on the web and thought it may help some of you new guys   Feel free to add any suggestions in the comments guys just thought i would share this as a base guide. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Computer Setup Before you start this, it is assumed that you already have broadband internet and some bitcoin to buy necessary tools. Use dedicated computer for carding purpose..never use it for your personal things. 1.) Install Xubuntu 12.04.04http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04.4/release/xubuntu-12.04.4-alternate-i386.iso 2.) Download that .iso file in win 7, after finished.. right click and there is option for burn image.so burn it into a blank cd or dvd 3.) Boot up the disc means when you start your computer everytime it will display the BIOS screen first. So usually press F11 or F10 key on your keyboard repeatedly to get into boot up option.Choose the dvd-rom 4.) So boot up the the disc and install Xubuntu on your computer, just follow the on-screen instruction. After installed.. update the necessary software. It will pop up and just follow the instruction 5.) Click the start button at the upper left.. and click Ubuntu Software Center. In the search box,type âVirtual Boxâ. It will display the result.. then click install button on the right..wait until finish installation. 6.) Click start button again..look for the installed virtual box. You should see virtual box.. so click the âNewâ button..and it will ask what type of windows..so choose appropriate windows. In this tutorial we will use win 7, so select it. It is recommended use 32 bit only because your Xubuntu is also 32 bit. Unless you choose 64bit Xubuntu, then using 64 bit win 7 is not a problem. 7.) Same as step 4. You get a win 7 disc..boot up from it and install the windows on virtual machine. After you installed win 7. It is recommended to disable the windows update and remote access. Click start.. right click computer. Go to Properties, Advanced System Settings - Remote tab. Start button again right click computer Properties Windows Update â disable automatic update 8.) Inside the win 7 virtual machine, install the following software.. Firefox browser - http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/ After installed firefox, install this add-on : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/ Mac changer - http://www.technitium.com/tmac/ CCleaner - https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard Hardisk serial changer - http://www.xboxharddrive.com/freeware.html Bleachbit - http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/download/file?file=BleachBit-1.0-setup.exe Tor browser bundle â torproject.org VIP72.org and vpn (means on xubuntu u already connected to vpn..and inside win7 vm..you also can connect to another vpn..means double vpn)  Filemind QuickFix, a program use to clear metatag file on picture/file. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT when you are on deepweb, bcoz sometimes you need to upload picture or upload files to share with other ppl.. so u need to wipe the file trace before uploading. Otherwise LE (law enforcement) can check the meta file and identify your location.Download here : https://anonfiles.com/file/de9377363820afb494cbdee9a98b8eed     9.) Setting DNS on Win 7 (Virtual machine)VM    Click Control Panel-- > Network and Internet --- > Network and Sharing Center --- >  Change adapter setting --- > if you are connected with Lan Cable.. right click Local Area Connection Properties -- >  Internet Protocol TCP/IP Version 4 --- >  Click Obtain IP address Automatically, and DNS use the following DNS Server addresses     Preferred DNS : 8.8.8.8    Alternate DNS : 8.8.4.4    10.) You also need to setting DNS on Xubuntu     -    disconnect everything.. lan/wifi/internet/vpn,etc     -    move the mouse to upper right.. look for up and down arrow (download and upload). click on it.. you should see list of wifi name etc.. go to bottom and click ""Edit connections..""     -    under ""wired"" tab, choose the wired connection 1.. and click ""Edit"" button next to it.     -    look for IPv4 settings and click it. you should see ""Method"", click it. and choose ""Automatic(DHCP) addresses only"" -    the DNS servers column should be blank and white.. you can input the ip address. input the google dns. which is 8.8.8.8    -    click save. you are done. - repeat the same steps under ""wireless"" *please note, if your computer connects to multiple wifi..you need to input the dns manually for each wifi name.    How to change computer name of Xubuntu - open terminal - type this : gksudo gedit /etc/hosts - it will ask for password.. enter it.. and you will see notepad opened.. look for 2nd line..  127.0.0.1 <name> so replace <name> with the name you want. then save the notepad   *ignored the *untitled document1, dont need to save anything -  type again : gksudo gedit /etc/hostname - it will ask for password.. enter it.. and you will see notepad opened.. put in any name you want(should be the same name as previous). and save the notepad - *ignored the *untitled document1, dont need to save anything -  restart your computer - you should see when trying to login, the name has changed.       How to change Xubuntu mac address - open terminal, connect to internet & type the following :       $ sudo apt-get install macchanger    *wait until installation finish .. if cannot install...try     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -   type this in terminal      $ ifconfig look for wlan0, you should see something like this 00:11:22:33:44:55 (this is the mac address) wlan0 = means ur wifi adapter    eth0 = your network adapter     disconnect your wifi/ethernet first     then type the following :   $ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down for ethernet   $ sudo ifconfig eth0 down  (still the same..except replace wlan0 with eth0, u should know what to do with next steps, if you change mac more than few times..sometimes the eth0 will become eth1,2,3, etc..so the command need to change as well. You have to go to âedit connectionsâ... move the mouse to upper right.. look for up and down arrow (download and upload). click on it.. you should see list of wifi name etc.. go to bottom and click ""Edit connections.."" then you might see âwired connections 2, 3,4..so delete the unused)  change your mac address type the following :   $ sudo macchanger -r wlan0  if it still says MAC is still the same.. try this   $ sudo macchanger -A wlan0             it should says mac address has changed         -    start the wlan0 back up                 $ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up         -    check if mac address has changed or not                $ ifconfig - Xubuntu now can connect internet and VPN, the run virtualbox (PLS NOTE â WHEN U RESTARTED THE COMP, MAC ADDRESS WILL CHANGE BACK TO DEFAULT, AND ALSO WHEN YOU DISCONNECTTED AND RECONNECT THE WIFI..MAC ADDRESS ALSO CHANGED BACK TO DEFAULT.. SO check properly before connect to wifi)

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","51288","2015-02-22T05:38:32","how LE tries to de-anonymize TOR users","Security & Anonymity","Hacking the Tor Network: Follow UpPosted in Hacking on January 6, 2015Introduction In a previous post, I presented the main techniques used to hack Tor networks and de-anonymize Tor users. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies consider âde-anonymizationâ of Tor users a primary goal. Authorities can try to implement techniques to break the encryption used to anonymize the traffic or to exploit vulnerabilities in one of the software modules that allows anonymizing the userâs online experience. There is also another option for authorities: to try secretly to destroy the overall Tor architecture or attack the hidden services to interfere with the traffic that flows to them.Operation Onymous Since the publication of the last post, a blow was dealt by the authorities to the cybercriminals that use the Tor network for illegal purposes. Police and intelligence agencies in a joint effort conducted the takedown of several illegal marketplaces as part of Operation Onymous. Coordinated by Europolâs European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), Operation Onymous hit the criminal organization that exploited the Tor network to manage black markets. The operation is considered an important success in the fight agaisnst cybercrime, but many experts have begun to question how law enforcement was able to locate the servers hosting hidden services and operators who ran the illegal activities. The developers of the Tor Project published an interesting blog post titled âThoughts and Concerns about Operation Onymousâ, in which they have explained the possible techniques adopted by authorities to locate the hidden services and de-anonymize the operators that managed the most popular black markets, including Silk Road 2.0. âOver the last few days, we received and read reports saying that several Tor relays were seized by government officials. We do not know why the systems were seized, nor do we know anything about the methods of investigation which were used,â states the post. The principal assumptions that law enforcement has made on the possible attack scenarios implemented by the law enforcement are:     Lack of operational security of hidden services    Exploitation of bugs in the web application    Bitcoin de-anonymization    Attacks on the Tor network The members of the Tor Project highlighted that the police has compromised the anonymity of the location of the servers behind the hidden services due to the lack of one of the following conditions:     The hidden service must be properly configured.    The web server should be not vulnerable: this means that it must be not affected by any flaw and must be properly configured.    The web application should have no flaws. An attacker that is able to exploit a vulnerability in the web server or in the web application (e.g. the e-commerce system exposed by the operators to propose the illegal products) could easily hack the targeted hidden service. Resuming, to de-anonymize Tor users it is possible to compromise a poorly configured server or the web application it exposes, and there is no need to search and exploit an alleged vulnerability in Tor architecture. By exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party application used by a dark marketplace, it is possible to install a backdoor on the server, revealing its location and the identities of its operators. Another possibility for law enforcement is to infect the machine of one of the alleged administrators with a spyware. The computer could be localized through ordinary investigations.Traffic analysis attack based on NetFlow Exactly one week after the disclosure of Operation Onymous, a group of researchers presented the findings of a study conducted between 2008 and 2014 on the de-anonymization of the Tor users. The researchers analyzed the possibility to identify Tor users and reveal their originating IP addresses; they claimed to have obtained a 100 percent âdecloakingâ success rate under laboratory conditions. The group led by professor Sambuddho Chakravarty, now researching Network Anonymity and Privacy at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology in Delhi, has published several papers on the topic over the last few years. The study revealed that more than 81 percent of Tor clients can be de-anonymized by exploiting the NetFlow technology designed by Cisco for its network appliances. NetFlow was introduced by the IT giant into its routers to implement an instrument to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. It is a precious instrument to analyze the network traffic managed by the router and identify the causes of congestion. The protocol is widespread, and many experts consider it as a standard de facto. It actually runs by default in the hardware of many other network device manufacturers. The technique proposed by Chakravarty and his team implements an active traffic analysis based on the introduction of specific traffic perturbations on server side. The researchers are able to de-anonymize Tor users by evaluating the effect of a similar perturbation on the client side through statistical correlation. In a previous study, Chakravarty demonstrated that an attacker can monitor a signiï¬cant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers by having access to a few Internet exchange points. The control of a few Internet exchange points allows the monitoring of a signiï¬cant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers. This means that a powerful and persistent attacker can run trafï¬c analysis attacks by observing similar trafï¬c patterns at various points of the network. The last study conducted by the team of researchers has revealed how to run an effective traffic analysis attack with less trafï¬c monitoring capabilities, such as Ciscoâs NetFlow, and run a trafï¬c analysis attack on a large scale. Previous research, in fact, suggested a significant effort to de-anonymize users on a large scale. The experts consider that previous techniques required an effort sustainable only by a government or by an intelligence agency. The researcher explained that a single AS (Autonomous System) could monitor more than 39 percent of randomly-generated Tor circuits. A traffic analysis attack elaborated in the last study doesnât request the enormous infrastructural effort as the previous techniques do, but it exploits one or more high-bandwidth and high-performance Tor relays. The team used a modified public Tor server, hosted at the time at Columbia University, running on Linux for its tests. Figure 1 â Traffic Analysis based on NetFlow The group of experts simulated the Internet activity of a typical Tor user: they injected a repeating traffic pattern (i.e. HTML files) into the TCP connection that they saw originating in the target exit node, and then analyzed the traffic at the exit node, as derived from the routerâs flow records, to improve client identification. Figure 2 â Traffic Analysis attack In the first phase, the researchers conducted specific tests in a lab environment with surprising results. In the second phase, the team started the live sessions using real Tor trafï¬c. The team analyzed the traffic obtained from its public Tor relay that served hundreds of Tor circuits simultaneously. The targeted victims were hosted on three different locations in the Planetlab, the global research network that supports the development of new network services. The chosen locations were Texas (US), Leuven (Belgium) and Corfu (Greece). The victim clients downloaded a large ï¬le from the server that deliberately introduced perturbations in the arriving TCP connectionâs trafï¬c, thereby deliberately injecting a trafï¬c pattern in the stream between the server and the exit node. âThe process was terminated after a short while and we computed the correlation between the bytes transferred between the server and the recently terminated connection from the exit node and the entry node and the several clients that used it, during this interval,â states the paper. The test sessions were organized in two phases based on the source of data analyzed: a first session to evaluate the effectiveness when retrieving data from open-source NetFlow packages, and a second part based on sparse data obtained from an institutional Cisco router accessed by the group of researchers. Figure 3 â Test results for Traffic Analysis based on NetFlow âWe present an active traffic analysis method based on deliberately perturbing the characteristics of user traffic at the server side, and observing a similar perturbation at the client side through statistical correlation. We evaluate the accuracy of our method using both in-lab testing, as well as data gathered from a public Tor relay serving hundreds of users. Our method revealed the actual sources of anonymous traffic with 100% accuracy for the in-lab tests, and achieved an overall accuracy of about 81.4% for the real-world experiments, with an average false positive rate of 6.4,â states the paper. The method elaborated by the researchers obtained excellent results: the researchers were able to de-anonymize traffic with 100% accuracy with in-lab tests and achieved an accuracy of about 81 percent for live sessions. Many experts speculate that the recent Operation Onymous, which allowed the seizure of several dark market places, may have exploited a traffic analysis attack against the Tor network to identify the operators of the black markets.De-anonymize Tor users from their Bitcoin transactions While the majority of Bitcoin users considers Bitcoin one of the most secure systems to pay online without being tracked by law enforcement, the members of Tor Project warned of the possibility that the recent Operation Onymous exploited the Bitcoin to identify the operators behind the seized black markets. In effect, it is possible to de-anonymize clients in a Bitcoin P2P network, as demonstrated by a team of researchers working at the University of Luxembourg. The researchers Alex Biryukov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Ivan Pustogarov published a paper titled âDeanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P networkâ to explain how to exploit a built-in flaw in the Bitcoin architecture to reveal the IP address of a client who makes a payment with the virtual currency. The attack consists in generating a âmalformed messageâ, faking that it had been sent by the user through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. These malformed messages cause the increase for the penalty score of the IP address, and if fake messages exceed 100, the IP could be banned for 24 hours. The mechanism is implemented as a DoS protection and could be abused to separate Tor from Bitcoin. The attackers force Bitcoin servers to refuse connections via Tor and other anonymity services. This results in clients using their actual IP addresses when connecting to other peers and thus being exposed to the main phase of the attack, which correlates pseudonyms with IP addresses. At this point, every time a userâs client makes a connection to the Bitcoin server, its address will be revealed. Resuming, if a Bitcoin client is proxying its connection over a Tor relay and sends malformed messages, the IP address of this relay will be banned after a specific number of messages, and the Bitcoin client will continue to work with its original IP address. This technique allows the isolating of any target client from the entire Tor network, if the attacker is able to force the separation of Bitcoin clients from the entire Tor network by sending malformed messages to every Tor sever. âFor the time of writing there were 1008 Tor exit nodes. Thus the attack requires establishing 1008 connections and sending a few MBytes in data. This can be repeated for all Bitcoin servers, thus prohibiting all Tor connections for 24 hours at the cost of a million connections and less than 1 GByte of traffic. In case an IP address of a specific Bitcoin node can be spoofed, it can be banned as well,â states the paper. âOnce the hacker knows this address, he can trick the Bitcoin server into revealing the IP address of the user,â states the post. The researchers described their technique with the following statements: âThe crucial idea of our attack is to identify each client by an octet of outgoing connections it establishes. This octet of Bitcoin peers [entry nodes] serves as a unique identifier of a client for the whole duration of a user session and will differentiate even those users who share the same NAT IP address. âAs soon as the attacker receives the transaction from just two to three entry nodes he can with very high probability link the transaction to a specific client.â The researchers explained in the paper that the anonymity in the Bitcoin virtual currency scheme is weak. Many features could be exploited to run a cyber attack on the crypto currency and reveal a userâs identity. Figure 4 â Trickling of ADDR messages The usage of Tor could increase the level of anonymity, but a hacker can always track users from their Bitcoin payments. âWe demonstrate that the use of Tor does not rule out the attack as Tor connections can be prohibited for the entire network. It shows that the level of network anonymity provided by Bitcoin is quite low. Several features of the Bitcoin protocol makes the attack possible. In particular, we emphasize that the stable set of only eight entry nodes is too small, as the majority of these nodesâ connections can be captured by an attacker,â states the paper. Another problem related to the anonymity of Bitcoin is that the virtual currencyâs lack of a robust authentication system makes it easy for an attacker to cause nodes to blacklist the IP addresses of seemingly misbehaving connections. âWe figured out that very short messages may cause a day IP ban, which can be used to separate a given node or the entire network from anonymity services such as proxy servers or Tor. If the Bitcoin community wishes to use Tor, this part of the protocol must be reconsidered.â Experts at Tor Project speculated that a similar technique could have been exploited by law enforcement in the recent Operation Onymous against black markets in the Tor Network, allowing authorities to persecute their operators. Mary-Ann Russon on the International Business Times reports that, as explained by researchers, a hacker could de-anonymize a Bitcoin user from its transactions through Tor for â¬1,500.Not only de-anonymization â¦ the seizure of the directory authorities So far we have discussed the possibility of revealing the IP addresses of Tor users, however there is also the possibility of compromising the entire architecture, targeting critical components such as the directory authorities. The Tor network relies on nine directory authorities located in the Europe and United States, which provide a signed list of all the relays of the Tor network. Experts at Tor Project highlighted that an attack to these servers can âincapacitateâ the overall architecture of Tor. âThe Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized servers in the network called directory authorities,â Tor Project leader Roger Dingledine explained in a blog post. âWe are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use â¦ We hope that this attack doesnât occur; Tor is used by many good people.â The seizure of the directory authorities could have the primary target to sabotage the entire Tor network, but it would not be effective to reveal the identities of its users. An attacker, by seizing at least five of the directory authorities belonging to the Tor network, could force Tor clients to connect other relays. This kind of attack could be conducted only by an actor that is interested in dismantling the Tor network. Experts speculate that law enforcement could run covert operations to block the infrastructure and hinder criminal crews that exploit the anonymizing system. This could be a serious problem. Do not forget that the Tor network provides a safe network from surveillance and censorship for millions of people who live in repressive regimes. âEvery person has the right to privacy. This right is a foundation of a democratic society.âReferences   some of these are plain http - but you already about that   http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hacking-tor-online-anonymity/ http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30160/cyber-crime/law-enforcement-operation-onymous.html https://blog.torproject.org/blog/possible-upcoming-attempts-disable-tor-network http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/31380/hacking/directory-authorities-block-tor-network.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29952/cyber-crime/operation-onymous-vs-dark-markets.html https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1545&format=pdf& http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30610/hacking/bitcoin-anonymity-hacked.html http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/18679 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-anonymity-theres-way-hackers-find-out-your-ip-address-1476605?32",""

[*-*-*-*-*]-Cheque Fraud 101-[*-*-*-*-*] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  My name is selectraz, I have been selling cheque data here and on TCF for a few months now. And since Spring is coming that means big changes are coming ! New minimum order of 10. (also in packs of 15,30,40,80 and 1,000 with savings upto 50% !!!) New data ! Less infomation..More recent and still smelling of 0day 'sploits  But first, Why should you start cheque fraud ?Cheque fraud is not a dead art. It is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Simple yet still effective. Why spend thousands on skimmers, dumps, plastics etc when a cheap laser printer and a little elbow grease can have you in store buying your girlfriend her new vibrator ! Why do cheques stand out as a method for payment. What makes it good for fraud ?Cheques are great because pre-printed security paper is easy to obtain as a regular citizen of the U.S. That means no nigger rigging water marks and micro-printing, etc etc.You have a professional industry standard paper at your disposal. Also another benefit is unlike using cvv in a fake merchant setting the victim has no recourse to preform a ""charge back"", That's right all sales once cleared are final ! And with a new found way to check if a balance clears before the actual charge, You don't need to worry about ""bounced cheques"". Top reason:You average john q smith, is very likely to print his own personal cheques, but is never going to make his own bank card. Banks charge a lot for paper cheques. So the information for the public to read on how to make a personal cheque cheaply at home, that has all the needed security features present to scan in the store or at the bank is available. If you look on Google ""how do I make a credit card ?"" professional white papers on security, fraud protection/mitigation and machines sold at staples for production to the general public is just not a reality. while on the other hand in the world of paper and business cheques, is a reality. A monkey could print his own cheques at home. Buy boxes of pre made cheques with a victims information on them or purchase security paper in bulk blank and use MICR Toner, with any regular laser printer. Highly available/public/professionally made/easy to get warez and shareware for production of templates. Bottom line your only limit is your imagination and motivation.

(both with cyber ghost in the background). could someone please look over the results and tell me if i can continue now to purchase in darknet, or if i do indeed need to change vpn program, and antyhing else? -could u guys tell me if it looks ok?bascially when i didnt us tor browser, i got two ""ip is blacklisted"" in red, other than that everything seemed ok.and when i used tor browser, the blacklisted thing was gone (switched to green), but i had a mismatch in my timezones. which i guess ill need to figure out how to fix, and why it was only problamatic going through tor. so using chrome, (with cyber ghost in the background set to LONDON), i got this: Please wait until the page loadsIP:    77.245.70.204User-Agent:    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/37.0.2062.124 Safari/537.36Browser:    ChromeOperating System:    Windows SevenActiveX Support:    NOBlackList:   zen.spamhaus.org    IP IS BLACKLISTEDdnsbl.sorbs.net    IP IS NOT Blacklistedbl.spamcop.net    IP IS BLACKLISTEDIP Timezone:    Mon Jan 26 2015 19:27:00 GMT+00:00System Time:    Mon Jan 26 2015 19:25:53 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time) OKLanguage:    HE-IL,HEISP:    ""REDSTATION LIMITED""GEO LocationCountry:    UNITED KINGDOMRegion:    ENGLANDCity:    GOSPORTDNS Servers:   95.169.183.219    GERMANYFlash IP/DNS:   89.41.60.38    ROMANIACookie IP:    normal statusAnonymizer:    Not FoundUnsecure Headers:    Not Found     AND USING TOR BROWSER (with cyberghost in the backgorund), I GOT THIS: IP:     176.31.190.158User-Agent:     Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0Browser:     Mozilla FirefoxOperating System:     Windows SevenActiveX Support:     NOBlackList:    zen.spamhaus.org    IP IS NOT Blacklisteddnsbl.sorbs.net    IP IS NOT Blacklistedbl.spamcop.net    IP IS NOT BlacklistedIP Timezone:     Mon Jan 26 2015 20:34:10 GMT+01:00System Time:     Mon Jan 26 2015 19:34:22 GMT+0000 (UTC) MISMATCHLanguage:     EN-US,ENISP:     ""OVH SYSTEMS""GEO LocationCountry:     FRANCERegion:     NORD-PAS-DE-CALAISCity:     ROUBAIXDNS Servers:    46.246.46.246    SWEDENFlash IP/DNS:    Cookie IP:     normal statusAnonymizer:     Not FoundUnsecure Headers:     Not Found",""

"Evolution Forums","fnufnu","17723","2014-07-23T20:46:09","On TrueCrypt","Security & Anonymity","As most of you have known already, the developers of TrueCrypt has stopped maintaining and updating the software anymore. On their page they've issued a statement suggesting users to go for BitLocker which comes with Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise, and probably Windows 8 too. (Never used Windows 8 so no idea about that.) Their statement also claimed that TrueCrypt is no longer safe due to Microsoft shutting down their services for XP. (WTF? How does that have anything to do with it? Who still uses XP nowadays?) The last known safe version of TrueCrypt is 7.1a, as 7.2 is reportedly unsafe. I have no idea why would the developers ever issue an unsafe version when they could just leave 7.1a be and post a simple post announcing their retirement. It is currently confirmed that the announcements were signed by the same key the developers have always used. But since we have no idea who the developers are at all, we have no way of knowing if the key is still secure or if it's actually them. TrueCrypt has been the best open-source hard drive encryption software around for years. It even made some spotlight when FBI failed to crack the encryption of Brazilian banker Daniel Dantas' hard drive in 2008. Of course, such incidents won't make TrueCrypt friend of the US and apparently, Uncle Sam had their way with TrueCrypt 6 years later, somehow forcing the developers into giving up TrueCrypt and directing users to BitLocker, a software that kisses Microsoft's ass. Currently, an audit is ongoing reviewing the source codes of TrueCrypt examining whether or not it is actually unsafe as the developers claim. But meanwhile, what concerns me more is that what software to turn to next. It wouldn't be long before NSA figure out a way to crack TrueCrypt as it has stopped updating now. BitLocker looks positively sketchy, and there seems to be few other options that does the job as well as TrueCrypt used to do. fnu",""

I mean after using it for such a long time, the same secrets I'm keeping now would've been exposed already had there been any loophole for LE to exploit. I would like to think that TrueCrypt developers were forced to abandon this project, most probably by big governments who doesn't like any info they can't know. But since there is no law to actually persecute the developers upon, they might have done some strong-arming or blackmailing to force them to quit, but not before they've given the world a tool to safely keep their rightful privacy. For the time being I'll be sticking with TrueCrypt. But like I said, since TrueCrypt won't be updated anymore, it's only a matter of time before the encryption algorithm it used was cracked. It might take years before that happens, so let's hope some new open-source software with a robust infrastructure will come our way before then. fnu",""

I have seen a lot of people recommend using a VPN to stay anonymous, but to me this seems like a bad idea. If I were to use the setup ME <-> VPN <-> TOR <-> SOCKS (somewhere near card's address) <-> website, then the VPN would be able to identify me, and know that I was tunneling TOR through it. This just doesn't seem like a good idea (I don't trust VPNs that claim that they don't keep logs). If I were to use the setup ME <-> TOR <-> VPN <-> SOCKS <-> website, then the VPN would not know about me, but It would introduce a permanent TOR exit node (unless disconnect and reconnect to the VPN periodically to change TOR exit nodes). My question is:     What purpose does a VPN serve in a scenario where I want to card a website and not get caught, except being another party that can gather information about you? If I am already anonymized by TOR, whats the connecting through an untrusted party like a VPN? Would the following setup not be sufficient for anonymity: ME <-> TOR <-> SOCKS <-> website ???",""

I want to convert my personal use windows-running computer into a machine that can be used for both personal activities and other activities.

Thanks!","Yasuo wrote:Basically, this is a solid setup:HOST OS: Debian- Use a VPN on this host. PIA/Mullvad/etc. Make sure nothing dirty is on your host. Download Bleachbit to regularly clean it. Bleachbit doesn't cover Iceweasel so you have to manually remove the history on Iceweasel.- Make an encrypted virtual machine using Virtualbox and Truecrypt(7.1a supports Linux). There should be 2 containers here. The regular one and the hidden one. For the regular one, you need to put decoy files. Cause when LE tries to break in, it would be obvious that you have a hidden container if you don't have decoy files on your regular container. Put some password lists, porn movies, anything.- Make sure your VM runs on your Hidden drive.GUEST OS: Windows/Whonix/TAILS/etc- Make sure to run another VPN in here.- Change MAC/HD Serial if necessary.- Always clean your trails with CCleaner.- You can still make another container here for your files.- For good anonymity, run TOR with SOCKS5.TIPS:1. After using, CCleaner your guest. Make sure there are no sensitive files on the desktop or anywhere that is really easy to access.2. Shutdown VM. Remove the VM from your Virtualbox. (Choose Remove Only. Not including the files)3. Unmount your Truecrypt drive.4. Bleachbit your Host before shutting down."

If you did could you please post or link the method?  On the topic of 3/4g dongle security here is my 2 cents: It's safer than your own home connection (duh) and in my opinion as safe as hacking neighbors wifi. Why? Because if they get allll the way down to originating IP then it makes no difference if you are using a dongle they can pinpoint (after triangulating... and it takes a bit of work) you to around a block size area, or to a hacked wifi 20 meters away from you. There are few things to consider if using a dongle. If you live in a house, don't use it. If you live in an apartment/condo building then it's much harder to pinpoint you, especially if it's a highly congested area. Best is to keep/store it somewhere away from your residence and use it there, some very crowded place. Do not travel with it, just in case, especially between your residence and other places. Pros of using it is also that it's a small item you can keep hidden in a quite a few places. Also destroying it after a month or 2 of use and buying a new one would be good, even weekly if you can afford it.",""

Look at the sellers stats when choosing someone, generally they're all ok to transact with - any bullshit and u can start a dispute using ur receipt as evidence and I'm sure staff will side with u The only way they could 'run with ur money' would be to effectively cease trading which I doubt would be worth their while...

I'm talking about the ones that you can purchase at local postal offices. Basically I need to know what type of shipping you can use the priority stamps for. When using the stamp to mail an envelope does it matter how big the envelope is (i.e. thickness, width, or length)? And can the stamp be used to ship a box or is it only for envelopes?

I will provide a free tutorial how to setup ur computer securely. This is also my first post and the point here is helping newbies and also a way to advertise my signature. Lets begin, the best method how you keep ur computer securely usually also has a lot to do with how you use your computer too. It is recommended you have several pc or laptop, always use your pc separately for certain purpose onlyFor eg : online banking, checking personal email, very important files, private stuff etc.. depending on your usage. Suppose you have huge amount of private offline data (for eg: huge database of stolen cc, child porn, terrorism plan, weapons, nuclear diagram or whatever shit lol) and need to be kept securely as possible. Always use encryption, eg:  Truecrypt http://www.truecrypt.org But if that computer stolen or hardisk broke, you could lose everything. So you have to perform a backup copy first and make sure it is always encrypted. U can save it on hardisk or usb drive, and always stored it somewhere outside your house/apartment. If ur premise being raided they always will search thoroughly your entire house. You also can stored the encrypted data online, if you want to do it as secure as possible, never use third party or hosting offered by others. You have to pay your own permanent hosting and only urself have access to it. How you use your computer is quite important too, from general point of view u have to categorize yourself into few identities. For eg : legit businessman/worker at broad day light and dark underground criminal at the night, just example lol. So that means, if you are browsing your normal personal email, personal banking, facebook, etc..  only dedicate particular computers for that activity. And when the nights come..you always use another computer for your hacking, phishing, fullz photoshop, carding activities, porn-surfing, etc.. as long as not so legit or grey matters.. and another is for gaming, or entertainment purpose. But this depends on individual, but it is recommended for separate computers, because you never know..for eg: if u mix your gaming pc with ur normal online banking, personal first computer. Suppose if some games you downloaded got virus or keylogger.. you are as good as you dead, it would capture all ur personal bank login and email password/facebook account..etc.. One of the very important things is .. never click any link claiming from bank in ur email, need to update bank security, routine bank/cc check, this is phishing attempt to steal ur personal info or download any attachment. Just keep it simple.. the first computer only for online bank transaction, email, paypal..etc.. never use the 1st pc to download any funny program or visit any funny website. This would save you away from any phishing attempt. Suppose in ur email received an attachment from well know sender.. these day mailbox like yahoo. Hotmail or gmail has inbuilt antivirus scanner so it keeps u away from malicious file that would steal or destroy ur pc, u also can install antivirus and make sure updated regularly. But if you still want to be safe.. you can use sandbox to open the attachment http://www.sandboxie.com/ Alright, now u have know abit how to handle your computer safely. We can move on how to setup carder pc. That means you are done with 1st pc that for ur personal use, now we switch identity to not so legal matter. You need virtualbox, which is virtualization software to emulate any amount of operating system on a single pc, depending on ur cpu may not able to handle so many virtual os. But you only need this only once in a while.. perhaps may not using it at all, depending on what you wanna do. MAC address, is a media access control address, which is unique identity assigned on your network interface for internet communication. Especially when you do carding or illegal matters, always change your mac id before attempt to start anything, after it is done.. can change ur mac id once again. You can download the software here : http://www.technitium.com/tmac/  it is like you attempt to rob 7-11 stores, you should disguise yourself as opposite gender first, or black become white vice versa, change hair color brown or blonde/black etc.. as it will make the investigation harder to trace u. For carding purpose, always use socks4/5 as it always needed you to impose as someoneâs else identity. Such as if ur in Europe, but using stolen CC from usa to card USA store. So socks4/5 gives you a proxy identity as u r purchasing legally from the country. The best socks4/5 provider I know is http://vip72.org they arenât free you have to subscribe. After you connected to socks, you can check first (by going here : check2ip.com)if ur ip address is blacklisted or not, and check the geographical location as if u are same location as cc and maildrop address  there are several ways merchant site identify your account, which is ip address, browser cookie, flash cookie (use http://www.piriform.com/docs/ccleaner/ccleaner-settings/cleaning-flash-cookies *download ccleaner), and personal details registered on the account. always change those info to avoid merchant link your account and ban both of it Hope it helps, cheers.

I know people always say this but the more effort you put in the greater the payoff will be. While the method is sound and works well if you know how to promote your finished product, the guide itself leaves a lot to be desired in terms of explanations.  If you've never worked with forums before then this guide is not ready to start making you $. There are a few tips and tricks required to make this successful, none of which are included. Things that are basic for some ( editing post dates, reg dates etc ) may not be for others. OP has stated he offers full support to anyone who buys it, but it would be much simpler to just include these tips in the guide. I wouldn't recommend this guide as is if you're a noob because it's written as if you should already have an understanding.... which defeats the purpose of a guide. Another page in his guide mentioning just a few basics that are important would have this ready to go for anyone noob or not.

I fucked with them quite a bit back in the day. They require a lot of effort initially each time you make a new one though. If you do it right. My best experiences has been running partners with this hustle because there is a fair amount of multitasking. It's a fun scam though which is why I really liked it.

Now they have found a giant hole in OpenSource version anyway. Apparently when you try to establish a https connection the remote site responds with a boolean (TRUE/FALSE) from something called a TLS. the problem is that many remote sites don't have a clue what TLS is (neither do i actually) but the bug is that they can return as true (out of ignorance) when in fact they are not secure. to make matters worse the whole thing executes in a GOTO statement. the hole has been there for 2 or 3 years in open source, but apparently nobody bothered to read and/or test the code. it's catch 22 - if the exploit gets revealed it obviously gets patched. were there amoral individuals out there exploiting it without telling. nobody knows. but i would submit that it can't be too bad because if people were being robbed - someone would notice. so just pretend you don't know about it,  if it hasn't hurt you yet, then it's just like the other thousand or so vulnerabilities that you don't know about. it is embarrassing though to the community as a whole.",""

For those who don't know, Tails is an operating system that runs on a USB flash drive. You can set up what is called a ""persistent storage"" to hold your files (encrypted of course). When Tails is shut down and the USB unplugged, all data (except in the persistent storage) is wiped. It comes preloaded with many great privacy features, including MAT to delete metadata from docs, openPGP, KeePassX, and others. It is pretty much everything you need to operate on the darkweb in one little USB stick. You can use it on any PC without having to delete the OS or in anyway change that PC's settings. I would highly, highly recommend Tails.","EludingHell wrote:Craig_Christ wrote:What exactly does tails do? Is it like a separate OS you can boot with?

Don't take my word for it, Google/DDG it, search around the forums. I don't use Whonix anymore so I can't say for certain, but have you manually change your DNS settings? I have manually specified my DNS settings through my router itself, then again through my OS's as a safety measure to make sure it's enforced. The result is no DNS leak from anything.

"Evolution Forums","Q_BlackWidow","17268","2014-07-30T01:48:01","Re: someone recommend me a good reliable VPN service!?","Security & Anonymity","I am currently using Nord VPN. (www.nordvpn.com/). Found them while digging through many many VPN services and trying them out one by one. Before Nord VPN I was using Private Internet Access which were a very good service. I just thought I could find better and more secure. I even used AIR VPN at one point but didn't like a few things about it. I even used Proxy.sh (www.proxy.sh) VPN services along with their proxy. I found the OS X client a bit buggy but other than that, they are a close second in my opinion. Their Proxy services worked well using a Proxifier to connect. It was stable and quite fast. Proxy.sh are based in Mahe which is a distant offshore island not under the umbrella of current US laws. Another one I tried was Ibvpn (www.ibvpn.com/) which is the ONLY VPN provider to utilize SSTP for Mac OS X computers. SSTP is a next generation VPN protocol, in theory, only for Windows and Linux clients but they managed to get it working on a Mac OS X machine. I have poured over the details of many service providers but they are the first to accomplish this feat. I would typically stay away from Golden Frog and other large VPN providers (HideMyAss come to mind) because they typically keep logs. Back to Nord VPN. Without a doubt, these guys know what they are doing. I am running Mac OS X 10.9.2 with Tunnelblick 3.4beta32. The config files to connect to the VPN are one of a kind. For example, they implement a connection called Double VPN. ""Double VPN is a security solution when the data is encrypted twice through multi-node farm. The encryption is double AES-256-CBC."" The user connects to the first node where the data is encrypted. Then the encrypted data flows to the second node and gets encrypted again and only then reaches the internet. At the moment they have only combination of Austria -> Netherlands nodes available for double VPN. Pretty cool stuff. Highly secure. The data is encrypted to 2048 Bits and they DO NOT keep logs of any kind. Some of the features of Nord VPN are: -Up to 1Gbps connection-No traffic logs-Unlimited bandwidth-Anonymous IP address-Secure server locations What takes the cake for me is their TOR VPN connection. That's right, I can connect to the TOR network without opening the TOR Bundle Software essentially giving my OS full reigns of the TOR network. Of course I don't torrent over it or use SoulSeek. So when I actually do open the TOR Bundle Application, it is already connected to the TOR network, therefore making the connection that much more secure by bouncing across even more nodes. After becoming soooooo happy with their service, which is dirt cheap, I bought a 1 year subscription which costs me 48 euros. This comes down to 4 euros per month. I think I got a month free as well. I would like everyone to know that this provider took me a lot of digging around and I was truly surprised by the amount of features this provider has. They are a small VPN company but definitely powerful nonetheless. No I don't work for Nord VPN. I am just an extremely paranoid user who seems to have found the holy grail of VPNs.",""

I do not endorse any sales neither I have been hired or have any official relations with the Evolution staff. I am just an individual who does free reviews on vendors based on experience and interaction with the vendors. Vendor Username: TopTuts Vendor Profile: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/profile/18315Store: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/store/18315Product: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/8178 Communication (8/10) Vendor is very understanding and friendly. Vendor shows professionalism however grammar is not too good. Vendor tends to reply to the messages very quickly which is a good trait when communicating. I feel English is not this Vendors first language even though they have good sentence structure.  Profile/Store/Returns (2/10) Vendor does not require FE. Vendor also does not have a return policy or important details on their profile description. Customers can become very confused and/or hesitate when asking for a replacement, refund or an exchange as there are no rules that clarify the TOS a customer agrees to before making a purchase. Product Review (10/10) The product is as advertised in the listing. In fact, even though the order is for the VCC , the vendor provides information on how to use this VCC which is a +1 in my opinion. Product worked fine. Product is as promised in product description + Fast delivery. Overall (7/10)Fast responses, Fast Delivery, Purchase is as advertised in listing, Good communication skills, and FE not required on purchases. Vendor can improve their rating in this review by adding a return policy and an introduction on their profile or contact details including but not limited to PGP encrypted messages only or instant messengers. Hope this review was helpful. If you would like me to review any product available in your store for free then please send me a message on the Marketplace.",""

One example of how this works is OEM operating systems. The MB serial allows computer manufacturers to only make one master OS which will work on all computers they make because it looks at this tattoo, or serial. You can have HDDs coming out of your ass, as some of you obviously do (which if your not a VERY organized person is a dipshit move I will not get into right now). Tracking this MB serial is not easy as pie, but is possible. So it all comes down to the same place every ""staying anonymous"" thread I have ever read. YOU ARE ALWAYS TRACEABLE, it is a matter of how difficult to trace you want to be. It seems as though this thread has a underlying message as to say swapping HDD is just as good as using burner machines. I would have to totally disagree.

I have a new laptop which came with windows 8 installed. I have replaced that with Ubuntu 14.4. I'm still learning, but figured it would do no harm to do an encrypted install. Its still doing this now ( how long does it take to encrypt a 500gb hd? 12 hours already) I want it to finish before i sleep But i am now wondering is encryption really worth it? I am never going to use the laptop for personal use. I plan to use Tails VM USB for darknet and 1 time access. Does a tails VM on USB need encrypting? Nothing is stored? But for some things i will need accounts/cookies so i am thinking another USB with a different OS (not sure which, maybe Ubuntu, suggestions?) then encypt this USB. Or am i thinking about this wrong? Should i be using the tails OS for everything, and just load the documents i require from another encrypted device? I think this way would be too time consuming? Yes i still need to learn how to use tails and VM and encryption, but i just want to ensure i'm taking a shortest, but safe path, instead of trail and error.  thanks for the help in advance ladies and gents",""

I've been reading and there's really vague answers. I used Universal USB Installer and it gave an option wen creating to make persitent. I didn't make persistent because I thought u can change that later. Reading on I really found no solution. Some people said modify casper-rw but I really have no knowledge of how casper works and I can't find any info on how to change it. http://askubuntu.com/questions/321302/xubuntu-live-usb-persistence-how-to   says Wen I entered this command as root, location is not found. So this made me wanna just format my usb and start over. I remembered reading a how to restore your usb key link on pendrivelinux's guide to create the live usb, so I wondered if I should just format normally or use the programs they recommended.http://www.pendrivelinux.com/restoring-your-usb-key-partition/ So 1) How do I make persistent or create a partition before/after creating the live usb?2) How do I restore to default settings? Tryna get this done quick and today, been working on this bs all day so im pretty tired, willing to pay if anyone can answer or at least point me in the rite direction. Thanx in advance!

Basically what it comes down to is can it be connected to you in any way? And what will you be using it for? Have you used the phone for any personal activities? It has a MAC address, so unless you spoof that then it can be connected to you. I don't think that part is likely, but it's possible. You'd have to buy a new phone anonymously, probably root it and spoof the MAC address. Use wifi that isn't yours, or an anonymous SIM card. If the app connects to your phone number, then you'll probably have to burn the phone number eventually. Using an android emulator would probably be your best bet, but then it depends on the application that you use, because most require to be connected to your phone number or require you to pay, and you can't pay with BTC. I don't know if this route would work for carding because I think some numbers are blacklisted for verification (not sure, not an expert carder).",""

While happily sitting back and watching how UNLIMITED cash streams of $50 or more per day start rolling in, its really that easy.So without boring you with any more nonsense, lets get right into the method:$50+ a Day In 10 Minutes!Enjoy,The MethodThe secret to making consistent fast cash online is harnessing the power of two money making services and fusing them with easy promotion techniques.The services used in this ebook are:EnviroFileandLinkbucksIn short, you simply upload files people want to download to EnviroFile, and then mask your link with Linkbucks. After-which you must promote your download link via popular outlets, the main outlet focused on in this ebook is YouTube.EnviroFileEnviroFile is a simple to use pay-per-download file-hosting site that offers amazing rates on each download, from $0.23 to $0.45 per download!The way EnviroFile can afford to pay so much per download is that all customers directed to their site must first complete an offer (usually a survey) before being allowed to continue and download the file.EnviroFile uses a tier system to manage the payments per download, below is the system:This is great for us because our payments per download increase as the download becomes more and more popular.Sign-up to EnviroFile and continue on...LinkbucksMany would of heard of Linkbucks, but if you haven't here's a heads up; Every time somebody clicks on your Linkbucks link, they are shown an ad before then continuing onto your link. In return for this, you receive a small payment every time somebody clicks on your ad.The payment for each click largely depends on which ad type you choose to display.Sign up to Linkbucks and move along throughout this book..The Powerful CombinationIf you haven't already worked it out, EnviroFile and Linkbucks together is a POWERFUL combination, maximizing your revenue from each download.Once somebody clicks your link, you automatically get paid, (just for them clicking a link!), then, once that person continues and downloads your software, you get paid AGAIN!Think about the possibilities...Look at these calculations based on only If you achieve 250 people visiting your link everyday (easily possible if you follow this ebook), and 225 continue with the download:(250 * 4/1000) + (225 * 0.23) = $52.75 a Day per LINK!Now, this is only using one link, and promoting one link only takes around 10 minutes. You could easily do this many times a day, creating more and more cash streams of over $50 a day!Also, EnviroFile's tier system constantly increases the amount of money you make with your downloads, look at the example below once a download as reached the last tier (10000+ downloads, taking 5 weeks at 250 clicks a day):(250 * 4/1000) + (225 * 0.45) = $102.25 a Day per LINK!That's right! Within 5 weeks after set-up,all your links will be earning double as much as they initially did, incredible!Implementing The SystemA Step-by-Step ExplanationStep 1 â Creating the AccountsFor this system to work you will need both an EnviroFile account and a Linkbucks account, if you have already created both of this accounts, skip down to step 2.Creating an EnviroFile accountHead over to http://www.envirofile.org and sign-up for their service.Creating a Linkbucks AccountSimply head over to http://www.linkbucks.com and sign-up to their service:Now that both accounts are created it's time to move onto the next step: Finding software/music/movies/etc to put up for download...Step 2 â Finding Items To Put For DownloadFinding items to put up for download is a crucial step in the system, you must choose the right item that people actually want to go through the effort of filling out an offer or survey to download.You could go with music, movies, ebooks, etc. But the most effective and easiest type of items to put up for download is:Software ApplicationsWhy? Well, not only are they small, which means even people with bad internet will still download them, most must be purchased, and when uploading software applications you can upload a second download containing a crack, key-gen or activation for the application.Thus doubling your earning income!Also, software applications are incredibly easy to find, with and without cracks. Though before explaining where to find these applications, first let me go through each type of software application you could upload:â¢ Free Legal Softwareâ¢ Software including Cracks or Key-gens or Game hacksâ¢ âFakeâ softwareAs the list increases, so does the potential to make more money. Free and legal software will obtain the least hits, while paid software with cracks or key-gens will gain more hits.Then there is âFakeâ software, the most profitable item to upload, yet the most flamed and risky.What is âFakeâ software? Well, its software that doesn't exist, yet a lot of people wish it would. Therefor, you gain a lot of hits on your link, as nobody has ever downloaded a working version of your application.An example of âFakeâ software is say, a Valid Credit Card Generator that supposedly can generate an unlimited amount of credit card numbers that have no bank limit attached to them.If you were offered a download to this application, will you bother to fill out a quick 5 minute survey to obtain it? This is exactly why âFakeâ software is the most profitable form of software to upload.But if it doesn't exist, what do we upload? Well, later on I will explain how to create this âFakeâ software to be very releasable and believable, including how to create a fake application to put up for download, but for now letâs go through how to obtain the other items on the list.Free Legal SoftwareSoftware that is freely available and legal to download can be reuploaded to EnviroFile for users to download, though this method attracts the least amount of downloads due to the file being freely available anywhere else.Such Free Legal Software includes:â WinRARâ Web Browsersâ Paint Programsâ Free Gamesâ EtcSoftware including Cracks/KeygensThis is my favorite item of software to put up on EnviroFile. People who want software yet do not want to pay the hefty price will usually be more then happy to sit through a small survey to get their download for free.Examples of this type of software are:â¢ Adobe Photoshopâ¢ Microsoft Officeâ¢ Sony Vegasâ¢ EtcThe best place to find this type of software is to look through warez forums, my favorite being:http://www.Warez-bb.org.comâFakeâ SoftwareâFakeâ Software is going to get you the most downloads by far. All it takes is an idea for what you think would be an amazing popular software application.After that, all you have to do is create a fake file with a believable amount of bytes and your done!An example of one of my very popular âfakeâ software applications is shown in this video:Http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pakbCGfeIHMHow to create a âFakeâ Software Application1) The IdeaFirst think up of an idea for your fake software application, the most popular are those based on popular free online games.2) The CreationSimply create and save a new txt file with a few words inside, then, rename the file so that it reads âFakeNameHere.exeâ. Of course, replace âFakeNameHereâ with whatever you want your software to be named.3) The RealismA 1kb .exe file isn't something most people would go ahead and download, so, search Google for a large image file, around 11.5mb large, and put it in a .rar with your fake software application.That's all there is to it!Step 3 â Creating the linkThe next step in the $50+ a Day In 10 Minutes Method is to create your download link, so that you receive payment from both Linkbucks and EnviroFile.NOTE : Currently EnviroFile is having issues with uploading files from Internet Explorer, please download and use Firefox to continue with the method.So after you have chosen your file to upload, head over to http://www.envirofile.org and log-inNow click on the âUploadâ button in the main menu.Next click Add File, then Browse to your chosen software.After you have uploaded your file, head over to the Account section and click View Files.Here you will be able to see your files uploaded for download, the link for each file, and how many downloads they have received.Grab the link for the file you have just uploaded and head over tohttp://www.linkbucks.comAfter logging into your account, choose the âCreate Linksâ option from the menu.From here you can now create a www.LinkBucks.com redirection for your download link.Fill out the form with the following information:Link to Convert: Enter your URL from EnviroFileLanding Page Content Is: Choose âClean (All Ages)âAd Type: VERY IMPORTANT choose âIntermissionâAlias URL: Choose either ârealfiles.netâ or âseriousfiles.comâAfter you have filled out all the information click Generate Link!You will then be presented with the link you must promote!Step 4 â Promoting Your LinkThe final and most important step of the system is to promote the crap out of your linkbucks link.The most powerful tools to promote your link are:â¢ Youtube â My personal favorite which has earned me insane amounts of cash.â¢ Warez Forums â Uploading cracks in EnviroFile files gets you a lot and a lot of downloadsâ¢ Password Protection â Similar to Warez ForumsFirstly, I will cover Youtube.The Youtube MethodThe Youtube Method is the fastest to setup, most efficient way to achieve high amounts of downloads on your files. Follow my simple formula for great results!â¢ Create a short 30-60 second video on your download and upload it to Youtube with a keyword specific title.â¢ Insert download links to your upload, a virus scan and winrar in the description boxâ¢ Repeat the process on another two Youtube accounts I will explain each in detailCreate a short 30-60 second videoFor this you will need two software applications:â¢ Video Creation Software (Windows Movie Maker)â¢ Voice Recording Software (Audacity)Now all you need to do is a create a small video, with a title screen, two photos of the software, and repeat the title screen to close. Then just record your self explaining how to download the software (and the crack if it has one) from the description box.Add both together, produce the video and viola! You now have a video<5mb to upload and promote your link with.Upload this video to a YouTube account.Insert Download LinksIn the description of the video, insert linkbucks + EnviroFile links to the software, the software's crack if needed, a virustotal.com virus scan and to a download of WinRAR.This way, each video will have 4 links where visitors can go and download, making you money.Finally, finish off your description box with a set list of targeted keywords about your software.Below is a sample template to use for your description.â Download âNamehereâ:Linkbucks urlDownload Crack:Linkbucks urlVirus Scan:Linkbucks urlTo UNRAR use WinRAR:Linkbucks urlkeyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword âRemember to use the keywords in the actually Tag box on YouTube.Repeat The ProcessUpload your video, with a different targeted name to another two Youtube accounts, keeping the same description for each.Not only does this triple your earnings, it creates a link structure between videos, so that potential downloaders will visit all three of your videos as they will show in âRelated VideosâThe YouTube Method is very, very effective.Creating a video and uploading it to 3 different accounts takes no more than 10 minutes, work on this for an hour a day and you can have 6 videos with 4 links each up every day!That's 168 links a week!Think about the earning potential. If the system flops (which it won't) and you only get $1 per link per day, you are still earning $168 a day, for an hour a day's work for one week!But, if the system goes ahead (which it will), those 168 links will generate many many downloads, if they only generate 10 each that's still168 * 10 * 0.23 = $386.4 PER DAY!And then once you complete 10000+ downloads, the tier program kicks in and DOUBLES your earnings to168 * 10 * 0.45 = $756 PER DAY!Just from YouTube, 10 clicks and an hours work.Warez ForumsAnother simple promotion technique is to upload games and software to other popular uploading sites such as:â¢ Rapidshareâ¢ Hotfileâ¢ EtcThen adding the crack or activation in an EnviroFile upload, after the user downloads all the other files from major file sharing networks, they wont mind having to download one more from EnviroFile.You can use this technique on sites such as:â¢ Warez-bb.orgâ¢ Team3xâ¢ EtcPassword ProtectionPassword Protection promotion earns the big guys THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS per month and can be very very effective if done right.The general jiff of this type of promotion is that the user downloads a file, then when the user goes to unrar their file, they are presented with a password screen, the password screen then instructs them to visit your EnviroFile link in order to download a txt file with the password in it.This method is extremely effective as the user just went through the trouble of downloading a massive file, they don't mind another small download to obtain access to their file.This method works well with software application, but the big money is in a controversial topic:Porn PasswordsThat's right, you supply a file with a list of porn passwords, then when the user goes to unrar the file, they must obtain a password from another file of yours hosted on EnviroFile.What makes this so effective is that there is so many people out their desperate for free porn passwords that they will do anything to get them.Using this technique on famous porn forums will let you a lot and a lot of cash.Final WordsWell, that's pretty much it.Use EnviroFile and Linkbucks together and drive traffic to your links, your earnings will SKYROCKET as mine have. I spent two weeks implementing my system and now I earn a consistent $2000 a week, and I never have to look at it again.I hope my methods work for you as much as they did for me, as long as you take action and do everything I have said in this eBook, you WILL be able to construct cash streams of $50 a Day in only 10 minutes of your time.Thanks for reading!",""

I decided to buy osama's tax refund guide for a refund between 900-1000 guide. Before the transaction, I spoke to osama on ICQ and he seemed to be a helpful guy. He explained exactly what was needed to complete the guide with the highest success rate, and also clarified what WASNT needed when filing the refund.  So of course given the convenience of him also selling 0agi fulls, I bought a few from him. None of them worked, all filings were rejected for numerous reasons. Amongst these reasons, dob doesnt match IRS database, ssn doesnt match IRS database, and of course a few already filed their own. When dealing with tax refunds you will always run into fulls that filed early, especially this late in the year. But info not matching IRS database is a mistake on the vendors part when sending me invalid info. The next day I told him what was going on (via icq) and he said he apologized and he would send me a few more for free. I waited one day and he never got back to me, the next morning he told me he was taking care of a personal matter and he would be right back, but again, he never came back. The third day, I icq'd him during the evening, he was not around so I left my pc on, during which time he tried to give me the names. Apparently I missed him. So after 5 days of cat and mouse, he told me he would give me the fullz at night....never contacted me, I contacted him once more and now im blocked.....  Osama honestly your guide seems to be legit but your customer service is misleading, also you need to double check the info of the fullz your selling before you actually sell them. Also dont make simple promises you cant keep. you couldve easily emailed me the fullz on evo since I left my pgp key in the encrypted msg I sent you using your pgp key....",""

"Evolution Forums","boccaccio","50187","2015-02-16T21:12:27","Advice needed for a properly secure system","Security & Anonymity","Greetings, I would like to start out by apologizing for the long post that is about to follow. I sincerely hope that someone will have the time to read it and then some more time to write a reply.I have already read up on alot of stuff and will continue doing so, but given the huge amount of information available, some pointers would be greatly appreciated. Life has taken a somewhat crappy turn and I'm in need of an additional source of income. Hence I've come here, looking for some ways to earn a BTC or two. I'm somewhat OK-ish with computers and enough time on my hands to tinker with security and stuff. Therefore I would be really, really thankful if someone could give me a detailed rundown on stuff that really matters if one doesn't want to be caught. I guess I'll start out with the system I have ar my disposal - it's a couple of years old business-class laptop with an SSD, 8Gb of RAM, full vPro support (CPU, chipset, wifi, etc), TPM and a free mSATA slot for an additional SSD. First, I'd like to figure out which OS should I be looking at (Tails, Whonix, Kali, Debian, etc...) and how I should run the OS? Is it recommended to keep it on an encrypted USB flashdrive, install it on an encrypted SSD (I do have some dmcrypt experience, if that matters), install it on a VM that sits on top of an encrypted SSD ore better yet, install it on a secondary, encrypted SSD, with Windows as default OS on the primary SSD, with bootloader on a flashdrive(no flashdrive = laptop boots normally into Windows)? What encryption should I be looking at? Is dmcrypt with LUKS sufficient? What algorithms should I be looking at? Should I invest time recompiling kernel and setting up TRESOR, and take measures to prevent DMA attacks? Can Intel TPM and vPro implementations be used/trusted to secure a system? Next up, VPNs. Given that they comply with the obvious requirements (no logs, no DNS leak, accept BTC, etc.) which one are the recommended choices? Does it matter (and how much, if it does), where are they located/incorporated. Is there any real difference between US located services, EU located services and services from ""neutral"" contries (Panama, Romania, Switzerland, India seem to be options). Followed by proxies... what (if any) recommended alternatives are there for vip72. I've been here for a few days and its seems that vip72 is pretty much the go-to provided, yet, at the same time, people claim that they have so many proxies that have already been blacklisted by various services, that it's hardly viable to use them,,, That is all the information I need, for now, to get started. I will be very, veeeeeery thankful if someone more experienced could find the time to answer to my questions.Thank you!  Cheers,Giovanni Boccaccio

Cash in mail could be an option too if you find someone you can trust.  Install a Linux distro on a USB stick, create an encrypted partition for storing some things. 8GB is plenty for the USB stick. Install a virtual machine on that Linux distro, and install Whonix on that. Connect to a VPN through your host OS, connect to a different VPN on the guest machine (Whonix in this instance), then the Tor network. If you want to be extra safe, only connect to the internet through wifi hotspots or cracked access points. Burning the laptop is overkill, if you do this method all you'd need to do is destroy the USB stick.  I would suggest doing a bit more research before becoming a vendor honestly. Make sure there's a market for your product, make sure you understand proper OPSEC, and stay safe.",""

The much more likely occurrence is that the system deleted your address when you canceled the order. However only the people who run the site know what happen when an order is cancelled. There is always the chance they are are rats (trust no-one) but this is also extremely unlikely. At the end of the day, even if we did assume the worst, the police aren't going to spend their time and resources chasing someone for a few pills. To put your mind at ease, I know of people who ordered bulk pills internationally without encrypting there address and they are still fine, stupid but fine. The whole point of OpSec is to setup a system that minimizes your risk if you make a mistake, ie. forgetting to encrypt your address. There are probably thousands of people who have used these sorts of marketplaces for years, with little concern for security, and they are still free people. The LEO simply can't afford the resources to chase after every recreational drug user, they're only focusing on the vendors. It is good for you to spot your mistake so quickly and to commit to developing a high level of OpSec.  I'm relatively new to this OpSec but if you have any questions about it or PGP or whatever, feel free to PM me.

TOR doesn't care where are coming from so long as you have an internet connection. it is possible that the wifi is filtering (blacklisting or using a word list) certain sites like porn or whatever. this could include a list of known TOR nodes - there is no way they could have them all since there are several thousand and they change all the time. i would suggest connecting to the wifi and then hopping off to a VPN, which would bypass any such filters and you should be able to connect to anything you want, including TOR. this adds to you security as well."

When I first started getting involved with carding and holding sensitive information especially anything related to fraud because if the LE kicked your door down and managed to get a hard drive with a load of CCâs and Loan applications not in your name well your f*cked thatâs obvious, before I ever bought a CC I made sure to secure my computer equipment, why? Because LE would have a very difficult time proving anything without evidence especially the most important kind physical evidence which holds a substantial amount of value in a court room. First things first  Donât be one of these people that has a million USB sticks and or portable hard drives regardless of whether you carded them or not because we as humans make stupid mistakes getting things mixed up ect , I personally have a portable hard drive with nothing criminal on it just photos and some legit work, I then have a 32gb usb stick with everything criminal on it from CCâs to even the link to this website , its hidden extremely well my best advice is for you not too keep it in the same room I use a desktop (I have a laptop but I donât personally favour them).  Do not keep anything incriminating on a computer PERIOD , anything relating to something criminal is a must to keep well hidden itâs easy to hide a USB stick not so easy or convenient to hide an internal hard drive , basic things like links to these such websites or market places must be hidden not saved on your desktop!!!. Ok scenario the LE are knocking on the door you have a desktop nothing criminal is kept on it but in these days and ages the NSA can do magical things and not even your hard drive is safe regardless of bleachbit/Ccleaner/eraser/DBAN ect ,I would recommend getting a hard drive caddy this is a way of removing your internal hard drive in seconds and launching it whatever , they are cheap and effective and come for both HDD/SSDâs they simply fit inside a spare disc bay. When Iâm away from my computer I remove the HDD using my Â£7.99 hard drive caddy from eBay and I store it off site or well hidden!!! Just in case my home gets raided (this has happened to personal friends of mine), itâs also easier to hide and remove a hard drive with a caddy instead of hiding a laptop purely because itâs smaller. Encryption to me is last resort why? Because the f*cking LE shouldnât of found my USB because it should have been well hidden! , I use True crypt (basic container serpent-two fish-AES hash is SHA-512) make sure your password is long and complicated as f*ck I use patterns to remember mine. hidden containerâs/partitions are very good when used to their potential they hide your files in the free space as random data BUT the NSA/GCHQ have spent millions on programs and cryptanalysis to exploit your hidden files/encryption so for me the most important thing is for the LE to never find my physical data storage, encrypt everything and anything but bear in mind the LE can probably break the encryption AES ect it just hasnât been made public yet!. Plausible deniability has its places it only works when well executed, example you wouldnât want to have a load of actual work files relating to you and then have hidden files on the same storage device thatâs just retarded because if the LE took it further to have it analysed your f*cked because it would link you with the hidden files so be careful and mindful of how you use this. Failure to give encryption keys to police in the UK is 5 years in prison so donât even risk them finding anything, if they raid your home rip your hard drives out take your laptops and shit fight them off and run because its probably less of a sentence, especially when Iâm already wanted on numerous charges and have been on the run for 2 years, always run bleach bit/Ccleaner after any computer session DO NOT USE PUBLIC COMPUTERS OR CYBER CAFÃâs. Mobile phones  Mobile phones for me were the biggest possible security breach when I was dealing drugs there easily track able these days especially smartphones, you can delete images and texts on an iPhone but with certain software you can retrieve it even if you reset/formatted your handset. Always have a bunch of 99p sim cards paid in cash you donât have to register them , Tesco sell a phone for Â£7.99 simply use that with a 99p sim , rotate numbers 2-3 weeks and rotate handsets every month or 2 , some people moan about throwing these items and having to buy new ones these are the people that will go to jail donât take the risk over Â£9âs worth of phone come on you canât be that poor , Iâve personally smashed iPhones with hammers and thrown them, itâs a good idea to have your (burner) phone with a removable battery to make sure it is actually off and do not turn it on at your address (sometimes this cannot be avoided) you donât need the newest handset to sell drugs , if police attempt to pull you or raid your home f*cking get rid of any phones linked with criminal activity as quick as possible its best to separate phone from sim (I have a friend whoâs swallowed multiple sim cards lol)  This was intended to be a basic noob friendly guide/my opinion, Iâll write another noob guide on communication and computer security at a later date Thanks for reading: D: D Pablo shrimp/bear111",""

Not sure of the actual posts, but sum1 gave me some good info that i didn't know. To make things that much easier, you can make a live usb (like TAILS) and remove ur HDD, start up from that. That makes sure you don't save ANYTHING to your HDD. I might add to that. You can have encrypted files, from another usb, that are only able to be decrypted in Linux. Also, take advantage of SD cards, the size alone makes it very easy to hide/swallow. I'm a huge fan of encryption tho and a huge fan of trickery. That's all, thanx for letting me chime in.",""

Unless your VPN is with a different company. Using any socks is dangerous and can result in your computer becoming a slave. Free socks are often offered to collect bots. Using Tor gives you an extra layer of security. Do what you want but I always chain with tor although a lot of people have a hard time with this. Seems like these people have changed all sorts of rules around and stuff instead of just adding Tor to the chain its like one step. It could also be that they are sick of trying to solve this problem for people, and don't see the need for it. Would be cool if they just had another download that included the chain. I think what maybe happening is where people choose to include tor in the chain can different and you don't want it chained multiple times and really slow down the connection.

The public wifi is really there as a fortress of plausible deniability that plays out as your last line of defense in case all the other opsec measures you're deploying are compromised, fail, or prove to not be 100 reliable at all times (like DNS leaks that can plague some VPNs). Because the truth is that each measure does have its unique weaknesses and you can't count on any of them to be 100% secure all of the time.  That's why originating from a public wifi is so important when you're doing heavy duty lifting, because none of the current methods can be 100% trusted, nor are known to be 100% reliable that can be depended upon. And leaving your fate in the hands of some incompetent admin of a potentially leaky VPN is what a toolbag would do.

So my question is what is the point on purchasing RDP services when we could just save cookies and inject them into our browser, then just use SOCKS?  Has anybody had any experience with this? I could really see this working since cookies are just txt's saved on clients.

What else do they try and 'check' to make sure the person is more legit? I'd be curious to know purely for technical reasons. You can change browser strings aswell to say you are coming from a particular browser. Your IP address that is in a legit location and not flagged as a proxy etc. Do they require Java to be enabled? If so that's where i imagine they try and profile your machine. And having a valid cookie that has been used for a previous trusted session which matches is up is doubt the main factor.

You should be safe, but if your asking have lots of people done this and not been busted then yeah. If it has to pass through customs worst thing that happens in most cases is you get a letter saying they want you to come on down and open it with them or they will burn it in 90 days, or no letter at all. If it gets found. If it doesn't need to be sent in the mail, why not use a drop? I wouldn't do it or recommend it, but its been done. Its not hard to be a little safer ya know.

I have done testing with other users and it is working and very unlikely to be burned. The advantage of this method as that there is ZERO trace to you and the funds will be 100% clean when you cashout. Also no verification is required. I am selling 5 copies only so get yours while it is still up.  If a mod that has a ps3 would like to verify and vouch this method I will gladly send a copy over.  http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/16690

Something in the indictment was very perplexing to me.  Apparently LE had access to IP's of anyone who entered the SR vendor roundtable.  How did LE unmask the ip's of anyone who went there?  That's a serious problem for vendors and regular users.  Following this logic apparently LE can get the ip of anyone who visits any darknet site if they wish.  This means that everyone on here can be identified in one way or another. This leads me to believe that nothing is really safe and that they are simply allowing the small fish to get away with small purchases/small vending ops. What are your opinions on this?  I found this over at deep dot web on the clearnet if anyone wants to look.  There's also an interesting indictment of some knucklehead ""fnu"" who was trying to order ricin and ""sell death"" as he put it....lol, I hope that guy gets his head knocked off in court, he was a murderous scumbag who made all of us look bad.  He was really planning on using it ... and setting up an op to sell more.  ON a side note, since Cirrus was indeed a LE agent, I am racking my brains to think of anything he had posted regarding opsec or anything else, so I can do the opposite thing.  I remember several statements other mods made such as ChemCat's frequent rants about torrc and exit nodes etc. but cannot remember anything that Cirrus said.  I would take his advice as what LE wants you to do.

"Evolution Forums","Fantino","44599","2015-01-22T11:44:27","Re: Dr. Clu from SR2 got knocked recently - comments and questions","Security & Anonymity","Not necessarily. There was a warning posted a few days before Christmas on The Hub, by former SR2 moderator Aries. He warned people that: ""... The infiltration of the market by law enforcement was much deeper than we originally believed now that the dust is beginning to settle. While the method used remains an unknown at this time, it appears they may have been able to extract user IPs that accessed the vendor URL....""  This implies that the method used was specific to SR2. It is also worthy of note that Cirrus posted the vendor URL on the Forum, which URL heretofore had been private, and restricted to qualifying vendors only. My understanding is that many people made use of that formerly-private vendor URL once it was made public, due to the DDOS attacks on the main site. Putting my tinfoil hat on for a moment, one might even argue that the posting of the vendor URL and the DDOS attacks were meant to drive people to a vulnerable/compromised system, so they might be de-anonymized.  Then you would be a fool.  If Cirrus had given out patently bad security advice on a continuing basis, this would have endangered his cover, as he would have been called on it by one or more of the technically knowledgeable people on the site.  Constant vigilance is never a bad thing, however going off half-cocked is a bad thing. Take precautions by all means, even withdraw from the Darknet if you feel it prudent, but don't lose your head like Chicken Little.

Braizeit:  If you read the post I did, they were referring to the market in question as ""darknet-1"" or something like that.  I feel like they may be describing this particular market.  I am not sure of this but it is a great possibility.  Obviously they are not going to mention the true name of whatever market they are currently working because it might cause people to stop using it.   It's concerning again because who knows if they have used parallel construction to bust this guy.  I don't know why he used the method of drops he did but something there just does not make any sense.  Why would anyone do that? I guess the moral of the story is just to be as cautious as possible.  Anyone who is even considering vending on here, even for smaller amounts, needs to reaaaallly evaluate every single aspect of their OPSEC and make sure they are not the low hanging fruit.   I honestly believe that LE is really tightening the vice on the darknet and really wants to take this particular site down.  I don't know why I think this.  Perhaps it is because it has been untouched at this point, as far as we know anyways.  Is it because Verto has done a great job of designing the site and it is difficult for them to infiltrate, or is it because there are plenty of people they would be interested in getting their hands on here.  I don't want to rehash the old debate of whether or not fraud items/counterfeit items/weapons etc. should be on here or not vs. drugs only but one cannot help but wonder if said items are just allowing more attention/more agencies to pay attention to this place.    Oh well, anyone else have any insight on this stuff?

Presumably they'll start with the largest and work their way down.  I have had some communication with Chemmy... as far as I can tell, they are still free. Needless to say, they're frightened, and with good reason -- if Chemmy were paid for being a moderator, then they are a definite target.  The smart ones have gone to ground. Chemmy and Tang would be very well advised to do so as well.  [snip] The problem here is that the people who need to tighten their security the most are usually the very people least in a position to do so as they lack the knowledge and skills required.  Ideally, the authorities would like to take ALL the DNMs down. As that is not likely to happen, they'll concentrate on the largest and best-known of them. (Silk Road was at the top of that particular heap, due to name recognition by the general public, if nothing else.)  I used to be of the opinion that certain items, e.g. weapons, fraud, etc. would bring in additional agencies to the mix, but I don't believe this to be the case any longer.

"Evolution Forums","frithnar","2176","2014-02-11T17:06:30","Re: Tails on usb vs tails live cd","Security & Anonymity","The biggest advantages of USB vs LIVE CD are speed and being rewriteable. USBs can be a LOT faster than LIVE CDs as well as store some information on them. At the same time, you may not want to store any information at all once you turn off the device in which case using a non-RW CD ensures that only the basic operating system is present and no leftover data.  I don't use Tails specifically so I can't comment on if it leaves HDD traces. However, unless you have the knowledge and skills to verify that it isn't leaving traces there is only one way to be sure it isn't: REMOVE THE HDD. Any computer from the last several years can boot from a USB HDD. So, remove the HDD from your computer, get a USB enclosure for it (they're only $10-20), and just completely unplug your everyday hard drive when you use the USB/LIVE CD. Then, when you're done using Tails, plug it back in and play games/whatever with your normal HDD (now on USB). That way you know for sure, 100%, that nothing is being written to that drive that you don't want to be.",""

Putin wants to crack TOR so he crack down on dissidents - not that he gives a fuck about drugs or CP. i imagine he's in bed a lot of those big time Russian gangsters who just might be behind a lot of stuff that gets sold on TOR sites. those guys over at Kapersky probably have the brain trust to work on it. they cracked the Stuxnet thing - which i consider the biggest hack in history. but if Russia gets a back door or whatever - i doubt that they will share with CIA or NSA, etc. give me two months and 1000 servers and i could crack it - or least part of it. it's a 2 pronged issue - finding the servers and identifying the users. i have read posts where some long running TOR sites have voluntarily shutdown and in the announcement they outlined many of the procedures that they used to assure anon, both in shutting down and it also offered a window into security while they were running. server locations could be identified by tracking traffic patterns. there are established algorithms for this. but if the site is being mirrored and the service being redirected to point at different mirrors, it makes the issue much more complicated. exposing users is a bit easier as they tend to use the same habits. if they were to constantly move from country to country, it would be near impossible to identify them, even if they used no security. i remember days before TOR when we had to use dial-up modems and jump from site to site. i think the Russian boast of $110,000 is most just that. i have been pondering how to collect on  the EVO bounty - which would of course stay secret. it's two different deals - the forum and the market. i would think that hacking the forum would be easier, as the source code is available, and an expert PHP guy could probably find a crack or two. i can get by with PHP skills, but i never claimed to be an expert. i guess i would have to go with the blind squirrel finding an acorn approach. it may take a long long time, but once in - i imagine there is a wealth of info that could be harvested. well - i don't have any time anyway to look for it anyway.",""

Yes, even Linux needs hardening. I know a lot of people are scared to use Windows as a host, but I know for  a fact, most ATM machines run either Warp/OS, Windows XP, or Windows 7 (granted they're in ""kiosk"" mode). And most banks in the USA run 90% of their servers on Windows and they undergo annual pen-testing (required by law) to prove their security is good and sound. The fear with using Windows is that its easy to get a virus in it's default configuration. However, if you just take time to harden it, it's actually very secure. Linux is great, don't get me wrong, but it's not a bullet proof solution right out of the box.  Having said that, once you pick your host, your want to hide your Tor activities by using a VPN that does minimum logging. TorrentFreak has a good article on VPN providers. Check it out if you haven't already.  Now the fear with VPNs is they they fail pretty easily (by design!). You prob already know a VPN creates a secure tunnel. If it looks like someone is trying to attack the tunnel (or if the connection is spotty) the  VPN tunnel closes and creates a new session. During that period there is a risk that your IP could b e revealed. Some people (e.g. banks) will use two VPNs side by side. Pretty easy to do in Windows, but it's a lot trickier (for me at least) in Linux and BSD. However, these people that use two VPNs don't normally use TOR. In a way, you can think of Tor as your second VPN. Should the VPN fail, tor will keep your IP address hidden.  Now you could go even further by adding a proxy, but I think (not tested) that while this will get you around tor blocks (websites like Google that block tor users with silly captchas) it might stop you from accessing hidden onion sites.  I think for the vast majority of buyers and sellers, a really great setup would be as simple as... - Clean install of Windows / Linux for Host- Encrypted hard drives (Bitlcoker, Enpoint, VeraCrypt) with strong pass-phrase- User account running as a standard and a strong password or pass-phrase- Screen saver on host set to lockout after 1-min (with pw on resume enabled)- VPN  with AES-256 and RSA-4096 running on host or physical router- Virtualbox running Whonix gateway & workstation- A strong since of paranoia  Tip: For password management, I recommend PasswordSafe or Keypass. Keep  some passwords on the host and others on the Whonix workstation.",""

I've been brainstorming myself, for the last couple of days, over a very similar setup. Namely a hardened linux host with whonix guests built from source (only real issue for me is KDE. I just can't imagine why something as bloated was made the DE of choice for a guest OS). So, yes, it's good to read other examples and possible scenarios. Perhaps someone more experienced can chime in on this and either approve the approach I intend to use, or suggest something better...From what I've, the only real problem with host->tor is the fact that your ISP can see that you are using tor. This can be circumvented by using bridges and pluggable transport (part 44 from Jolly Roger's guide that can be found on deepdotweb[*clearnet*], among other places). While bridges doesn't seem to help all that much, as they still leave you open for DPI, pluggable transports such as obfs3 and meek should be sufficient. Or am I wrong? Also, not per my personal experience, but I've read more than a few times on these forums, that vip72 has way too many blacklisted proxies. Haven't found a solution for that, however I've seen truesocks being mentioned as an alternative. Cheers!   EDIT:In JR's guide he gives numbers for existing obfs2 and obfs3 bridges. I'm taking those numbers with a grain of salt, as the guide is not exactly what one could call up-to-date. Only thing I did find was the number of users using bridges. For obfs3 it's over 8000 (pun intended, source - torproject metrics).

Look at the thread I wrote about Amazon EC2. I don't think your project would be eligible for the free usage tier but you could see how much you could get away with. Like I said, I don't know what the end game is here but you could play around in a sandbox to chalk up you ideas.  Create two VPCs connected by a VPN tunnel or route.   VPC 1: 10.0.0.0/24VPC2:  10.0.1.0/24 (publicly accessible) Assign an EIP to the public facing interface and as long as you've explicitly set that EIP to an interface, rather than assign automatically, the IP should persist through reboots, etc.  Use that IP with your DNS records. So then the only administrative overhead is managing the public facing VPC with the VPN.  If something happens or you are blacklisted you just change the EIP and your internal subnet stays the same.  I would not suggest working with reverse proxies but it really depends on your application.

In fact, I know many countries that don't have a DMCA policy and aren't allies with the U.S which easily makes it bullet proof because chances are if they don't care about DMCA + Aren't allies with the U.S then they will most likely allow all kinds of stuff on their servers.","DarkBear wrote:I'm having a hard time getting bullet proof hosting.I can find close.I just need a VPS for like $30 a month.So I've found some possible solutions such as routing through DNS servers to hide the true IP to prevent abuse reports from hitting the hosting company.

Semi managed would be cool, I can do unmanaged. The only problem with unmanaged at least back in the day when I was running a bunch of servers (2004 - 2009) is if I fucked up and install, I'd have to re buy or pay like $70 for them to re image the drive.

Free lessons for all! ==============================================================================  How to get a CVV number from a credit cardThis tutorial shows how you can get a CVV number from a credit card if you have all the rest of the information but you don't have the security code. You can try sites that doesn't verify when you spam the server with too much credit card info attemps. One of those is PayPal. You can add a credit card and if everything is correct it will let you add it but you can have the CVV code wrong. Since it is wrong you wont be able to use it until you enter the correct security code. Just edit the information and start trying different codes. When the one that matchs your credit card information is correct, Paypal will say you have to verify the number they sent to your statement. So now you have the working CVV number for your detail. There is another sites that also doesn't verify several info attemps, like Liqpay. This is only working when you only lack the security code from your detail. A lot of people gets all the rest of the info and they lack the security code. Since they don't know how to get it easily and safe most of times they void the card when trying too much to discover it. Remember this is only for the CVV code not any other information.   ================================================================== How to DoS Attack Tutorial Simple Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are pretty straightforward. You just pick a system, select an open port, and then start sending lots of traffic. If you want some help (you probably will), you can find other hackers or infect zombies. At its core, this kind of attack is really pretty straightforward and simple. The real question here is whether you have enough scale to overwhelm your target system.Find a Service to TargetThe first step to mounting a DoS is to find a service you can target. This would be something with open ports, something with vulnerabilities, and certainly something that will accept incoming connections. Some of these services include:   *  Web servers  *  DNS servers  *  Email servers  *  FTP servers  *  Telnet servers These services almost always accept incoming connections. Oftentimes, they even accept unauthenticated connections. Once youâve found a service to attack, the next step would be to overwhelm that service.Overwhelm the ServiceIdeally, it should be a service that doesnât have a maximum limit to the number of connections. The best way to find out whether a service doesnât have an upper boundary on number of connections is to send it a few hundred thousand connections and then observe what happens.But to achieve optimal effect, you have to send specific queries and information. For example, if youâre targeting a Web server with a search engine, donât just request a web page or slap F5 a bunch of times. Instead, request a complex search query or something thatâs going to consume a significant amount of horsepower to resolve.If doing that just once already has a noticeable impact on the backend, then doing that a hundred times a second would probably bring that server down. You can do the same thing against a DNS server. You can force it to resolve complex DNS queries that arenât cached. Do it often enough to bring that service down.For an email service, you can send lots of large email attachments if you can get a legitimate account on its server. If you canât, itâs pretty easy to spoof that kind of attack.Those are some simple service-based Denial-of-Service attacks that you can mount almost universally. Again, itâs just a matter of finding the services that will allow you to do this.Now, if you really canât target specific services, you can simply flood a host with traffic. That can still work, except that the attack might not be as elegant and would certainly require a bit more traffic.So now, let me show you how to mount a simple DoS attack using the environment Iâve set up just for attacks.Mounting a DoS AttackLetâs assume that weâve already done the network footprinting and scanning and enumeration processes. So we have a pretty good idea of whatâs going on in the network weâre targeting. Typically, I use a paper notebook and screen cam a lot of it to gather a lot of screenshots.In this particular case, Iâm going to show you a window that appeared in one of my videos. It was on the Advanced Port Scanner. In that video, we found a bunch of different systems on the network.One particular system, 192.168.1.16, wound up being a Windows 2008 Domain Controller, as well as a Web server and a couple of other things. Letâs assume this is the system weâd like to attack. Knowing that it has all of those things, I know that I could mount a Denial of Service attack against it if I wanted to shut down the authentication process or Web service and all that kind of stuff.Iâll now proceed and launch my favorite tool for attacking systems like this. Itâs called the Low Orbit Ion Cannon or LOIC. First, Iâll specify the IP address of the server I want to attack, which in this case is 192.168.1.16. Then Iâll Lock on to it. After that, Iâll choose a port that I know is open and that accepts incoming connections. For example, Iâll choose port 80 to mount a Web-based attack. Iâll then select TCP to specify which resources I want to tie up. Finally, Iâll click on the button to start mounting the attack. Youâll then see the Requested data increasing rapidly. That means the attack has begun. Depending on the situation, one client attacking this way may or may not immediately affect the performance of the server. But a Denial of Service attack doesnât have to stop with just one client.In a typical DoS attack, you would mount this attack against different ports at different times and try to footprint whether your actions are affecting services, impacting them in a noticeable way, or, better yet, able to shut the server down.If not, you could scale this up by running the Low Orbit Ion Cannon on a dozen machines or even a hundred machines at the same time. A lot of this can be scripted. Meaning, you can capture the traffic and replay it at the command line on different targets or play it as part of a script from different attackers, which could be your peers, your zombies, or both.This is the easiest tool to understand because itâs pretty darn obvious what itâs doing. It may start to slow down a little bit, partially because youâll be consuming resources on the client and also because the server itself would either be running out of resources or starting to defend itself against your attack.Some hosts can be configured to look for patterns to identify attacks and start defending itself. To counter their defense you could, for example, stop the attack momentarily (by clicking the same button you clicked to mount the attack) and change the port youâre attacking. To add a little confusion, you could slow the attack a little bit.In our example, weâll change the port from port 80 to port 88. If you review the screenshot on the Advanced Port Scanner youâll see that port 88 is also open. Once youâre done changing the settings, you can resume the attack by clicking the attack button again.  With that, youâll be attacking a different port, which amounts to a different service, at a slightly different way, and at a different speed. Speed is really only important if youâre attacking from one client. If you have a hundred different clients attacking at the same time you can slow things down at each individual client and still be able to mount quite an effective attack.That is how an attack would look like when you do this kind of DoS. The only thing I want you to be cognizant of here is that Iâm only showing things to you from one machine. It would look the same on each individual machine if I did it from hundreds or thousands of machines.Distributed Denial of Service AttackA Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack would be practically that same attack carried out by many different people at exactly the same time. A DDoS attack is only complex in terms of scale. The actual attack itself, from the perspective of each attacker, is exactly what you just saw.One reason why some people use malware to launch these attacks is because malware can be timed to launch the attacks at exactly the same moment.  ===================================================================== Cardable Sites 2013 (Not Tested Lately) - Someone wanna test?? Here you have a list of cardable sites that have been tested to work in 2013. bestbuy pickup If you picker is in CA you need everything from CA i mean rdp cc and all..  dont do alternative picker use picker name as billing name and u good to go .. hp envy work cool .. if you wanna card macbooks .. call them with voip number to place order on call with cool debit besiness card and u good to go  wish.com they ship slow but are good .. use good signature cards .. 414709,414720 and co normal placing .. socks or rdp works .. create fresh facebook account, go to wish.con and start wishing to your house  People are fools nowadays in the carding scene expecially the kids.

Scientific American ( www.sciam.com ) has published an article entitled 'How to steal millions in chump change' which was about online credit card theft. Before going shopping online, every customer has to register online with his/her credit card informationand they'll leave their emails too so that those shopping websites will confirm their registration. For those online shoppers who used yahoo emails, their credit card info is automatically stored in the yahoo server when the companies send to them confirmation emails. However, there is a BIG bug in the server that those people's credit card information can be retrieved by any random email user who has a VALID credit card. To simplify this, here is how it works: Send an Email to confuse a hotmail server mailbot, so that it will return to YOUR EMAIL with complete information on people's credit card information stored in the server in the last 72 hours. This is how you will get people's VALID credit card information. Now you have to do exactly the same as follows: EDIT: removed redundant information expiration date (This is line 35, has to be LOWER CASE letters) 0000000000000 (This is line 36, put a zero under each character, number, letter, hyphen, etc) E-mail(This is line 47, has to be LOWER CASE letters) 0000000000000 (This is line 48, put a zero under each character, number, letter, hyphen, etc) 252ads (This is line 51) Return-Path: (This is line 54, type in your email between ) s_ You have to make sure you do EXACTLY as what is said above and the credit card info above the 0000 are absolutely CORRECT/VALID. Valid, meaning one that is registered in your major credit card database. For those who like to play it safe, thinking this is too good to be true. Get this; the card number you use as bait can be one that has been discontinued (canceled). However, it cannot be expired and the card information must be correct. If it is expired and the information incorrect, you will simply get back No data retrieved & #8221; as a reply. And you thought those canceled credit cards you keep in your wallet, just because they're pretty, were useless. Here is a sample email: (CAUTION! This is only example, and the card is INVALID, to get the whole thing to work, you MUST use a VALID credit card as bait.

When the one that matchs your credit card information is correct, Paypal will say you have to verify the number they sent to your statement.So now you have the working CVV number for your detail.There is another sites that also doesn't verify several info attemps, like Liqpay.This is only working when you only lack the security code from your detail. A lot of people gets all the rest of the info and they lack the security code. Since they don't know how to get it easily and safe most of times they void the card when trying too much to discover it.Remember this is only for the CVV code not any other information."

In our connected world we live in a place where we want to be connected to all things media. Most people get this media via television although this can get very costly when we add up cable/satellite bills + premium channels, buying/renting movies, paying for streaming companies, etc. When you look at the fact that people now-a-days are actively looking to where they can save money and often âcutâ the cord with their TV provider. Well I would like to say there is no need to lose all of your favorite TV shows/movies/NOR sport channels! BUT you sure can save a lot of $$$ (each month, let alone over years) for following this short 10-minute guide. For this guide, you will still need a laptop/computer which you can optionally hookup to a TV but an internet connection is required. It does not matter what you are running whether it be Windows/Apple/Roku/Android/RPi/Linux/etc. With that being said, you can use a cheap <$100 android computer and hook it up to your TV making it a Smart TV which functions for this purpose. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Q&A:*What all can I watch? Anything and everything.. Trust me it helps if you know what you going for. It does not matter if your looking to watch a TV series (you can easily find almost any) or a Movie (almost any) or watch the Live NFL Redzone (or any specific game/sport for that manor). And I am not joking either about ""almost any"" - ask me if you're looking for specific movies/tv shows I will let you know if they are there. *Is this illegal? In sense you would be streaming paid-for applications such as movies or sports. But even if your watching pirated material this is only a individual act of copyright violation and is only punishable if the copyright holder KNEW you did this BUT they can only take you to civil court.. So given you don't post it on facebook, you will be fine. *Since it is on the darknet, I assume you're just sending me peoples users/pass for sites? NO! I am not using anyone else's login details in this. So no, you do not have to worry about people changing their password or having 100 different accounts for different sites. *How am I getting access to these shows/programs? People host available streams that you can watch. When I say streams, don't get me wrong. You can watch almost any movie/tv show from beginning to end and you have the option to start at the beginning, to pause, or skip to the end when ever you would like. *Does this cost anything after buying the guide? No it does not, other then electricity & internet to power your TV/computer. And no you do not have to stream behind a proxy/etc if you don't want to - obviously it is up to you. *Does this work for non-US counties? Yes it will, and many channels are actually made specifically for other countries. As I know I have seen a Canadian channel and many middle-Eastern channels too. *How many others do this? This actually uses a pretty popular program but fewer people know about the tricks/add-ons that can be used. Nor have a seen a guide that details how-to do everything with all of the files included in such a convenient 10minute guide. *I don't know anything about computers, how easy is the guide? If you know ""nothing"" I would say it is medium difficulty in the fact that at one point you have to browse your computer directory to find some .zip files for the addon's, but if you can do that, then this is an easy tutorial (quite literally <10minutes if you know what your doing). *You saved me a lot of money, is there anyway I can give you some extra to show my appreciation? Sure you can! I will be making it so that you choose your option under shipping costs. If you wish to donate then choose the ""Donate $1"" and enter the quantity you would like to send  *I see it says v1.0, does that mean there will be updates? Yes, after major updates or if different add-on .zipâs are needed, I will make necessary updates to my âNo More Cable Billsâ guide!    Forum Link: http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?pid=223105Store Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/40729 I am selling 5 free copies on my store link to those that wish to make a honest review of this. And I am not looking for people to just review ""Good"" or give away details during the review either..  Have any questions or reviews? Please post below!

Have you ever used the evo market before? You having >500 posts would suggest you are familiar but I am not sure..  In ANY listing on evo, they will put how long it takes to ship the item. Since my item is digital, I can put one day delivery (like every other digital vendor does). For physical goods, minimum shipping time is 4 days that a user can put. Like if you are going to go buy some crack, just because it says 4 days on it, it does not mean it only lasts for 4 days or that the half-life is four days, but shipping time is four days.

I am trying to make this set up work... But i still have some questions and i would be very grateful if you could help me with info. Anyway thanks for just reading this and waiting for you answers on my silly questions 8). Sooo, I have already installed Whonix on encrypted bootable usb. Also i have bought a VPS server and configured openvpn on it. Right now i am sitting Whonix => VPN => Tor. But i need to have a normal, non tor ip on exit, so i am thinking to add some vps next. The main problem is that i cannot decide which service should i configure... As i understand there is two ways - configure VNC(or some other RDP) or configure Socks5 connection. As for me its much more comfortable to configure VNC. But i am not sure that this works... So i have few questions: 1) Does Whonix works fine with VNC?2) I am new to VNC, so i have a little bit stupid question - Where to find in logs from which ip i am connecting to my VNC server. So i can check that i am still sitting VPN+TOR+VNC. Looked in a log file, which is created after vnc server starts, but no info about ip of people who connects the server... Maybe i should look this info elsewhere like main server logs , etc?3) Maybe it is better to configure Socks5 servers on VPS and than add theme in the end of chain? Is there a manual elsewhere to connect Tor with Socks5?4) Is there any programms or services which can pentest my anonymity, except dns leaks online test. 5) How can i traceroute and check is the scheme work properly? Standart traceroute command?6) If i am using Whonix, which works on encrypted USB, should i also change serials of my hardware? Or Whonix protects me? Thanks everyone for any advice and help.

Hope you can say to me what you think about this setting or if you think that this doesn't work. Like I said i'm quite new to staying anonymous. First I have my host system in which i'm going to use tortilla to route everything through the tor network. I also have a vpn installed which routes through tortilla. On my host system I have virtualbox whonix which again goes through tor. In whonix I use virtualbox windows with tortilla and vpn and proxy.  It's probaly sounds a bit weird but this is able to work. One question though. tortilla goes through whonix and does that mean it's like tor->tor or is that just tor? In a nut shelltortilla->vpn->tor->tortilla->vpn->proxy Hope you all can give me some advice and help or agree that this is a good method. P.S. I forget to mention that I also want to use tails on the host OS but haven't installed it yet.

I would personally probably set up a MITM exploit. btw vpn in US is not required to keep logs. that doesn't mean LE can't force them too, just like they look at what you check out of library. most of them keep server logs (like apache) but not user logs like when and where and for how long like your ISP does. i just bought 5 vpns from AVG for $40/year. that's $8 a year for each one. they are not secure as they can easily be traced back to me. they even have a little client program you run that configures everything i am not a carder but i do know how to get prepaid debit cards in other names, so it would be easy to get them in a fake name and then they could be used as part of your security. i didn't get them for security - i got the for some boxes around the home network the old lady uses for facebook and daughter uses for gmail.",""

"Evolution Forums","moka","1684","2014-02-05T22:35:16","Re: ----------------","Guides Vendors","First I need to thank Yasuo for the review.  I appreciate the time you took to write this up and I appreciate your honesty.  You bring up some very good points.  I have been doing this in some capacity or another for well over 10 years.  I authored many h/p/a/v/c documents in the late 90s and have seen things grow to where they are today.  I decided to focus solely on affiliate marketing and the like in 2008 and have not looked back.  Affiliate marketing itself is a scumbag, bottom feeding, crumb snatching, industry and my method leverages this which is why it is impossible to saturate.   This document is part one of two and focuses on long term goals.  The first document is geared towards beginners and does a lot of hand holding.  There's no reason to be intimidated.  However, this is not a smash and grab, blast 400 dollars through PayPal to a Polish card and be done with it.  If that's what you want, I cannot help you.  If you want to create an environment where you can work a method like a hobby or a part time job and create consistent income, this is perfect for you.  I only have one listing on Evo.  All future listings will be directly related to my method and all content is original.  Part two of the guide will be posted in the next few weeks.  It picks up where the first guide left off.  If you are an advanced user and you understand the ins and outs of ecommerce, wait for part 2.   --- jim456789 asked about the maximum monthly yield.  I know it's a tired and cliched answered but ""it's really up to you"".  This is about creating an environment where you have more control over the parameters of the transaction, end to end.  One of the common themes in affiliate marketing, especially PPC, is that you should replicate what works for you 10x, 100x, 1000x over.  Leverage tools that can automate basic tasks and the sky is the limit.   If you were to follow part one of the guide, you could expect to easily make 1000 USD in a month.  Especially with the second payment processor.  Thanks!",""

I aim to be very open and transparent.  I'm not the smartest person here but I do know what works and what doesn't in regards to SAFE and consistent money.  I don't know shit about jail and I'm never going to know shit about jail.  I hope you won't either.  Ideally we would have a group of 3-5 really enthusiastic people working together to make some money.   IMO, not enough people think about my kind of angle.  Everyone acts like a consumer instead.  I don't think you have to work that hard but it's all perspective of course.

"Evolution Forums","moka","1684","2014-02-11T16:47:32","Re: ----------------","Guides Vendors","Deep_root, we spoke earlier but just to address your question out in the open-- You just need to understand what goes where in a traditional ecommerce transaction.   What I really like about this method is that you can reuse resources such as drop accounts that may otherwise get burned if you only stick with PayPal, etc.   Most newbies are not in a position to create their own drop accounts, especially multiple accounts, so they often end up paying 50, 60, 70, sometimes several hundred dollars for accounts that are underutilized.  If one doesn't work, we pop over to the next one.  That's why I jokingly call it Active Failover.  We have a lot of options.   ---

Normally I would call myself technically advised and able to deal with any kind of technical problems that do arise. This one is just giving me bad sleep, though. Since a few days, it seems like my OTR over Pidgin, especially ICQ, does not seem to work properly. I am using Whonix 8.2, everything up to date. I installed pidgin and pidgin-otr. As soon as I try to start a new private conversation, all that shows up is ""Attempting to start a private conversation with..."" and then nothing happens. My partner never receives these OTR handshakes and thus, only non-OTR chats are possible. I have no idea what could cause this. I am online over a 3g burner phone, connected to a VPN and then there comes my Whonix GW/Workstation. I created a new ICQ account to see if these guys are suppressing OTR handshakes (you can identify them by sending ""?OTR"" to others.But it seems like this new account also is not able to to send OTR encrypted messages. I eventually ended up downloading a fresh Whonix .ova and setting up everyting freshly. Did not work at all, OTR is still failing. I also spawned a new VM, used SOCKS5 and Windows to tunnel pidgin through this VM so basically ICQ would assume I am a regular user.Nothing. I would appreciate it if some of you could add me 677296714 and try to start some secure conversations. Cheers",""

I'm a brand new vendor and would like to see what I can do for you! I offer ANONYMOUS cash and bullion delievered directly to your mailbox. I just setup my first listings ranging from $20 - $1000.  First off, MOST OF MY LISTINGS ARE FULL ESCROW. You can read the full details in my profile, but basically any order that totals under $250 of cash in the mail gets full escrow protection. I have no choice but to require FE on orders over $250 due to the instability of BTC and DarkNet markets. If you are interested in a listing that requires you to FE I will provide emergency contact info and tracking for your order so you have NO FEAR that your order will arrive as it should!

"Evolution Forums","young-black-male","46704","2015-01-31T21:16:31","Hiding fingerprints","Security & Anonymity","Just posting this as a general discussion area on the best discreet way to hide fingerprints in public. Obviously in private you can wear 2 or more gloves on each hand, or at least one pair of thick gloves, but there are certain situations where one might wish to conceal their fingerprints in public, for example when passing counterfeits. So I've come up with a few ideas, but I'd like to hear your input: Rubber cement: Okay, but shiny (stands out on skin) and peels off when sweatyKrylon Matte spray: I haven't tried this yet but it sounds like a good idea. The matte finish would blend more with the skin, and as long as you do several coats there would be no latent prints. And being a sort of spray paint, it should stick well.SPFX sleeves: Ideal as long as they fit well, but at $650 maybe not practical for everyday criminal activities. Any other ideas?

For each round of Darksend, the user selects two to eight (or even more) rounds of mixing which vary the degree of anonymity achieved. Random Masternodes are then elected to perform the coin mixing. Masternodes are trust-less, in the sense that they cannot steal user coins, and the combination of multiple Masternodes ensures that no single node has full knowledge of both inputs and outputs in the transaction process. To avoid a ""bad actor"" scenario, in which many Masternodes are operated by an adversary who wants to de-anonymize transactions, a deterrent has been put in place in which 1000 Darkcoins are required to own and operate a Masternode.[4] As an incentive for operating a Masternode, chosen nodes earn 20% of the mining rewards.

ISP > TOR ISP> VPN> TOR VM>Whonix > VPN >TOR > VPN > SOCKS5 VM>Whonix > VPN> SOCKS5> TOR TAILS > VM > TOR USB Linux > VPN > VM > Socks5 >Clear net  okay ISP--->TOR your ISP sees you connecting to TOR which is not illegal (it may be in some countries) if you live in a small town and are suspected of illegal activity by your local constabulary, then this is probably going to raise a red flag. if you live in a large metropolitian area you activity will obviously be more obfuscated. when they took down DPR they had pin register taps on his home router, his upstream ISP rouuter and  on a router at a coffee shop 500 feet from his apartment. as always my recommendations, which are followed by some of the pros, state that your level of stealth must be predicated by the action at hand. it is different tyring to card a bogus credit card than trying to compromise a top secret military server. but my general observation of ISP-->TOR is that is not usually an optimum configuration.    next you go ISP--->VPN---TOR. to my logic this is by far the most commonly used config and offers many advantages with the VPN. they are too numerous to mention here. but other people will tell you not to use VPN because they lie and log your activity. i don't understand that logic. why would a company whose main selling point is not logging or keeping logs --- keep logs? of course it is possible that Homeland Security (or even FBI illegally) can be tracking and logging on their own - or in HS case they may have a Patriot Act order that prevents the VPN company from notifying you and also forces them to log your activity (against their will). so what -- all they can log is that you fired off TOR. of course you probably will want to add SOCKS5 to the end.   VM>Whonix > VPN >TOR > VPN > SOCKS5 no. you didn't mention what OS you have to hold the VM or what kind of VM. i assume you mean to load Whonix gateway client inside the VM. (one word about VMs - they allow for multiple configs within them) now you stick a VPN on there, which i am not quite sure about and don't even know if it is possible. it may well be, i have never tried it. But then you add TOR and that fucks up everything, because Whonix is forcing all traffic through TOR so if load TOR on top of it, you are running TOR on TOR which may sound like a good idea, but it is strongly discouraged in the TOR docs. so that's enough to break that chain right there without even addressing the extra VPN and the proxy.    VM>Whonix > VPN> SOCKS5> TORthis is completely absurd. not only are you running TOR on TOR but then you chaining a proxy to the VPN and then running TOR. this completely negates the socks5 as one its main purposes is to disguise TOR exit nodes. obviously your TOR exit node will be naked, if it hadn't already been fucked up by running TOR on TOR.    TAILS > VM > TORNo again Tails is a bootable version of TOR. you don't want to boot to TAILs then try to load a VM and another version of TOR  i think you do not fully understand the VM. you start with an OS - say KALI - you load a VM - say Virtual Box or VMware. once you have a virtual machine you need to install an OS. TOR is not an OS. the Whonix gateway provides you with a sort of virtual router (and can be an extra firewall) in your VM. you then install an OS - a lot of people use XP - but can use other things, like TAILs or the whonix client or Win7 or some distro of Linux. then you run TOR and add your proxy to hide the fact you are using TOR and also to geolocate you where ever you want to appear to be originating from.   USB Linux > VPN > VM > Socks5 >Clear netthis will work but you still need an OS in your VM. of course you don't have TOR. so what would do is add OS after VM then TOR then socks and browse clearweb as the socks5 IP.   tails leaves forensic no traces on your box - so if you use a USB stick as a self contained system, it may be that it doesn't even see your local harddrive and writes its temp file, etc to your USB install. you can certainly test this by pulling your HDD and running your USB build. TAILs on the other hand boots into TOR and creates a RAMDRIVE where it stores all temp data and on exit it wipes your RAM completely. so there is no trace on the PC that TOR was ever there.i am swamped now but if i ever get time i think i could create a setup that uses a RAMDRIVE with regular TOR on a USB setup so that it would delete all the traces as well.   incidentally there are other setups that don't use TOR at all. You can combine a series of proxies, VPNS, and SSH tunnels, to make yourself anon. the only time you actually need TOR is if you are trying to access a TOR Hidden Service. there are tons of other tricks (like making yourself a relay - you can even hide a service on there), but as i said the whole thing is predicated on what you want to do. like i told a guy yesterday - it's easy to knock over an armored car if you have the balls - and you don't even need TOR. in most setups the computer opsec can be easily adapted to whatever you want to do, it's the other aspects of your venture that you have to worry about, not the least of which is what to do with the money. i wish there were as many threads about that as there are on VPNs. BTW they are many different ways that VPNS and proxies can be configured. they are not all equal. A VPN is said to be 2.5 layer between layer 2 and layer 3 of network model. there are MLPS (multi layered protocol) VPNs, single user VPNs, multi user VPNs and several different ways the server can be configured for each.",""

This can be done by using the Iceweasel browser (web browser) and not the tor browser. Download and save, then drag from completed download window onto desktop. Open and click extract. Then run tor as normal. Thanx for the suggestions, you don't know how much that relieved me!

If anyone has done this how hard do they pursue your identity?They require A & B forms so passport, drivers license, I.D card etc and also gas bill/proof of address etc.Fake photo I.D cards and bills are not too hard to come by but is it worth the hassle and money for them?What checks do these companies carry out as it supposedly takes 24 hours to open an account.I'm also thinking of physically picking up stuff from the company rather than have it forwarded to another address.This is setting off alarms in my head like CCTV and such.I know if things do go wrong I really dont have much plausible deniability as I would at a normal address.I'm also currently on the lookout for a business address and am thinking of renting a small shop front of some kind for drops but there again, I.D will surely be required?

Anyway the guide itself does give a free method which will tell you the inforamtion, although Bogga puts a lot of emphasis on the carding success rates if the name doesn't match the electoral roll, carding isn't really my thing so maybe johnjones or andigatel can chime in if that is the case.  I do think however the prices is a tad excessive and maybe Bogga should reduce it, how much though I'll leave that up to him.

It's nice having a little ""app"" I can use, and change servers as I please. Private Internet Access was tedious to set up, and I would always get disconnected from their VPN. I'm so happy right now that I decided to try out Nord. It seems more protective, they have tools such as encrypted chat, tutorials, and a huge amount of information about VPN's in general. They have an affiliate program where they give you a link or banner to give out, or for example, put in your forum signature, and when people click your specialized link and sign up, you get paid commission! You technically could have made some money off of me haha. I definitely wouldn't want that link on here though, due to the fact that I registered with some sensitive information. Thanks again man, this is only my second VPN provider but I'm astonished at how flawless it is working. Plus, $40 for two years ($1.67 per month) is dirt cheap for the protection that I now have.

Let me Introduce myself here for the first time. My name is Dr.Chemist a long time Organic Chemist with a PHD. Now I am here to share my knowledge with the community on the synthesis of many substances but currently I will be talking about LSD. I have been creating this wonderful substance in a Professional Lab for many years. Now I am here to share my expertise on this with the community. I have a self written guide in progress which should be done by the end on the week on the synthesis of LSD. Now anything you have read online my own personal notes on the exact steps it takes to create this magical substance. It is going to be highly detailed including; -Index-Materials/Glassware and Chemicals List-Supplier List-Detailed Exact Step By Step Guide-Exact Times and Measurements-Lighting for Each Step-References To Zubricks Book of Organic Chemistry for reference-Glossary This is a method that is simple to follow easy to complete for someone who can understand. Now you will need a good base in Chemistry to synthesize this substance. Now many people seem to think that LSD is the most difficult Substance in Clandestine Chemistry to create, well that would be wrong once you have acquired all the materials especially the ET (Ergotamine) its all basic chemistry. Now for those who do have the base and whoa re interested in learning how to synthesize this substance in its purest form Needlepoint and Fluff Crystal than please read on. I will be offering this guide on the market soon among other markets as well as my Crystal LSD and Blotters all 250ug Custom Blotter Paper. First I will be offering this detailed guide on the synthesis of LSD for anyone. I mean anyone who has basic experience and who is willing to learn. Lastly I know that acquiring ET is difficult but I will also be selling this as well. So I ask the community what do you believe I should be charging for all these? I will be doing Full Escrow as well as using other markets and especially ones that use Multi Sig Escrow. So what should I be charging for this guide? As well as the ET? LSD Crystal Fluff and NeedlePoint will be at a price that is reasonable what do you all think. Please let me know. Any Questions Please Don't Hesitate to ask I have jabber as well as ICQ ORT Only. Leave comments below Thanks Dr.Chemist",""

"Evolution Forums","homersimpson","41167","2015-01-06T04:24:37","Re: False first name, true last name vs Your true identity opinions please","Security & Anonymity","signatures dont matter either. plenty of CDs have went down without them. i know people who have had pink slips left in their box (asking them to come get box at post office), chalked the order up as a loss then had feds bring the package inside their house and open it up in the living room a week or so later. international mail from certain areas will always require a signature if tracking is used, this is 100% normal. also USPS express mail will sometimes require a signature to prove to the sender it has been delivered, though this option is usually able to be 'waived' by sender. also, if a box is too large to fit inside mailbox, some mail carriers will bring box to door, some will ring bell and hand it over, some will just leave it on the step, this varies depending on the mail person/where you live. signatures are just an easy way for LE to get the target outside of the house so they can watch them closely or just tackle their ass on the grass. CDs are getting more advanced every month it seems like i know someone else who was having weed sent and LE opened it before delivery, installed some kind of a sensor inside the box which would alert them the second it was opened up by my friend, sure as shit,as soon as he opened it his door was blown open. both of these cases were in SMALL towns too so i cant even begin to imagine what kind of resources LE in major areas are working with... they dont care whose name is on the pack, if its a fake name, they will tear up the entire house and if they find a spec of evidence to use against anyone, they will all be charged. if you pickup a pack that is addressed to 'billy bob' yet you have it opened up and chillin in your home, the name doesnt mean a thing. all LE needs to be able to prove is that whoever lives at the address was aware of what was in the package, and if its been opened, then thats all the proof they need. I do know of a person in my area who had a large pack of pot shipped to him, LE detected it at airport and delivered it, waited 24hrs or so then came with a warrant. the mans house was 100% spotless and he never opened the package - he moved it to the trunk of his vehicle and denied any knowledge of its contents. the charges against him were dismissed pretty quick but this is probably the only way you can get out of a jam like that. i have been doing this stuff for quite some time now, im trying to take a step back and get out of this business while i still can. the anxiety and paranoia are getting to be too much for me to handle. my advice: only order personal amounts to home addresses. there are plenty of safer options for bulk orders. at the end of the day it is SO MUCH better to just chalk a bulk order up as a financial loss than it is to have it intercepted and LE come knocking. if you do intend on receiving big packs of anything, have it sent somewhere that is in no way shape or form tied to your true ID. fake IDs and other documents are your best friend and you would be surprised what kinds of things they allow you to accomplish

You guys really underestimate the USA criminal justice system.  Second, once they charge you, you're screwed. You gonna fight them? To fight them you risk like 10x longer sentence, but of course you would if innocent. Then you get a jury and a judge. Think you can convince them? Hope you can afford a real expensive lawyer. Otherwise, SOMEONE is going to prison.  Also, say you order qty X... it's all for personal use (for real). That doesn't matter. Just because of the quantity, it's considered resell. Also remember: They will do whatever to get info... even if the method they use would be inadmissible in court. Stupid war on drugs. Makes me sick.

Also have heard sporadic reports of local LE hitting buyers. Whether they do a huge sweep one day, who knows. They may. They SAID that would be their next action. They may come arrest you for something you ordered a year ago. And, despite your fantasy of a perfect defense, you'd be screwed as soon as you are charged. As for databases - you are on the right track I think. Certainly they have, or will develop, a database of 'high risk' names and addresses.

In the end, most of the feds pretending to be dealers ended up, you guessed it, bumping into eachother and the attempt was considered an ""epic"" failure   The tip about having your dropper use a bag to carry around the goods is a good way to do it and look like you're walking to the store, or a nearby PO or something. We use this method, as there are people EVERYWHERE walking around with shopping bags where our places are picked. Ever sit and watch how many people walk right up to a bank or plaza drop box? You'd be surprised, there's way more mail going through that box than you would think. Unless you live in nowheresville. In which case, I suggest doing your dropping in a nearby, populated area. It might be more work, but it's best to blend.  As for gloves.... I don't use them at all.I dry glue over my fingertips, and I never leave marks. I've tested this by handling a piece of tape like crazy, and trying to spot anything looking at it through a light. I never see anything. Peeling glue off is fun","young-black-male wrote:emily wrote:Terrible advice, IMO.The more people involved in your operation the more risks you face.+1.

Different setups for different opsecs is something that is situation based. What works for some people might not work for others. The best thing to do is to really, really think about you're doing, and above all else, have a plan, stick to it, and forget that you even have an opsec. I'm not saying I do involve x amount of people in an production, but there certainly are people I trust enough to invite them in if I choose to. I would certainly distance myself from them though, through that person's proxy. This means bringing in more people, so I don't suggest it. The more people involved in your ops, the more people can blackmail you, or just fuck your entirely life up if you get into a stupid fight. I've seen amazingly good vendors brought down by their fucking bitch girlfriends after a breakup, because they knew about the operation. Someone I know, I won't be too specific here, said people who snitch are primarily... A pissed off girlfriend.This applied to selling weed, but it wouldn't surprise me. It's a similar game afterall.

First of all I'd like to thank Lokmannen for giving me the guide for a discounted price. Says a lot about this vendor. It wasn't because I wasn't ready to pay the full price for this guide (as i'd actually pay triple the price for this) but rather it was a kind hearted favour as he knew it was all I had in my evo wallet at the current time. So again I'd like to thank him. Now unto  THE  GUIDE Just perfect. Infact I don't see why you wouldn't buy this guide. With the high demand of the Amazon Refund service on evo, Lok has done the whole community a favour by releasing this guide. Especially since the method is nearly impossible to be saturated! (Remember Amazon turnover $60 daily) It is well presented, easy to read & even comes with pictures to help assist readers as they attempt their own double dips. The guide comes with various methods of how to get your refund/replacement, so you can choose one that you're comfortable with. The methods are also extremely easy yet very effective! Its quite funny looking at some of the picture scripts at the 'fight' some of these amazon representatives give to save their company money. lol!  I'd definitely recommend purchasing this guide, especially due to it's limited copies. It may be your only chance, especially since Yasuo's gone awol.  As well as the guide you're also paying for a mentor as Lok states in his listing, he will help you out with any trouble you have & will even guide you through your first refund.  Extremely pleased, STATIK

You could even go as far cutting sheet metal with a hole in it for the sensor and placing it in the mailbox (same concept as a secret compartment).

Down below are his words, buddy.   connect directly to what? what is your ip showing up as when you check it online like at ip-check.info? Maybe your chain is in the wrong order. Maybe you are using some weird ports or something when you were originally trying to get it to work. This one dude couldn't get it to work forever cause he was putting in values he found somewhere instead of 9151, no idea why. Once he did it worked. Maybe uninstall and start over, cause I dunno whats been changed. With a fresh install it should be pretty easy. Download the bundle, install it. Then all you need to do is add the chain rule in proxiefer. ----Profile --> Proxy Servers -->Then add tor, 127.0.0.1 port 9951.vip72 should already be here as 127.0.0.1 port 9151.(if you downloaded the prefigured version of proxifier from vip72). Then click and drag to the box below with tor being first and vip being second (exit node).--- It might be your default port for Tor is not 9151, maybe 9050. but you can just check in the client. --- You dont need to do anything else it will automatically work in firefox and other programs as the rules are global, when the proxifier is running and the vip72 client. You should know chrome leaks though by sending it a 407 error it will automatically leak. ---- Also if you have any other software installed and even if its not running it can mess it up (like super socks).",""

This entire affair nearly drove me insane. So I feel your pain. Proxychains First download & install proxychains:sudo apt-get install proxychains Then configure proxychains to setup your chain:sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf Down towards the bottom you should see: [ProxyList]# add proxy here ...# meanwile# defaults set to ""tor"" Just write your list in using Tor as the first listed: socks4 127.0.0.1 9050socks5 ip.address.here port After that you should be done. Just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains:proxychains firefox  Proxifier If you are on Windows you will want to setup your chain using Proxifier. First download and install a cracked copy of proxifier. Once you have it installed and run go to Options -> Proxy Settings and configure your chain: Code: Select all    127.0.0.1  | 9050 | SOCKS 5    IP.ADDRESS | PORT | SOCKS 5   Once you have set your proxy settings go to Options -> Proxification Rules and set the following rules: Code: Select all    Loopback | ALL | 127.0.0.1 | ALL    Tor  | tor.exe | ALL  | ALL   Once you are finished go to Name Resolution, choose Remote, click OK, and you're set. Keep in mind that if you use Proxifier you need to use a browser that isn't already configured to connect through Tor or it will ignore the Proxifier settings and just route strictly through Tor. For this guide my recommendation is a copy of Firefox Portable that has been secured.  Instructions for Proxifier 3.0 Profile -> Proxy Servers -> Add. Address 127.0.0.1, Port 9050, Socks v5 -> Ok. Popup box will ask whether to set as default. Select Yes. Now add your proxy you want to use in the same way. Click 'Proxychains' button then 'Create', and drag & drop to the new rule. You should have something that looks like this. Code: Select all    New    127.0.0.1:9050    IP address:port (the details you entered earlier)   Now go to Profile -> Proxification Rules. In the drop down menu for 'Default' select 'Proxy socks5 127.0.0.1' & uncheck the localhost rule. Then Add -> change action to 'Chain new'. ->Ok. Next, Profile -> Name Resolution. Select Resolve hostname through Proxy.

I personally prefer Whonix Gateway + Workstation than just the TBB when I browse DW, but I also use the TBB and don't feel it is a major security risk. It is true, BillBryson, that the community is rather split when it comes to VPN->Tor or Tor->VPN. From what I have understood after reading and discussing with members that know more about these matters then myself, it is better to go Tor->VPN than the other way around. And I am inclined, although not 100 % convinced, that going the other way around is nothing but a great security risk whenever you do something illegal that can be linked to you in one way or another. Personally, I dropped the VPN altogether. What it does is essentially to protect against sniffing from evil Tor exit nodes. And in my case, that wouldn't be much of an issue if it happened while I was carding (in 90 % of the occasions, I might add), although I understand that it is different for others. Decide according to your own circumstances and what the information that can be revealed to a sniffing exit node means in terms of your own safety.

"Evolution Forums","Midnight_Sun","51417","2015-02-22T20:09:45","Re: how to install tails on a mac book without a disk drive!!","Security & Anonymity","Straight from the TAILS project website (""Manual installation using Mac""): Find out the device name of the USB stick The device name should be something like /dev/disk8, /dev/disk9, etc. If you are not sure about the exact device name, do the following:     -Unplug the USB stick.    -Open Terminal from Applications â¸ Utilities â¸ Terminal.app     --Execute the following command: diskutil list This returns a list of all the current storage devices. For example: $ diskutil list/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                 SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                     *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                      209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS MacDrive             250.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                        EFI                      134.1 GB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP             115.5 GB   disk0s4 Plug back the USB stick and run the same command as before: diskutil list A new device should appear in the list of storage devices. Check that the size of the device corresponds to the size of your USB stick. Unmount the USB stick --> Execute the following command, replacing [device] with the device name found in step 1: diskutil unmountDisk [device] Run isohybrid.pl on the ISO image:  You need to modify the ISO image using isohybrid before copying it onto the USB stick.  1. Download syslinux  2. Double click on the package to extract it  3. Copy isohybrid.pl from the /utils folder to the desktop.  4. Copy the ISO image (for example tails-i386-0.17.1.iso) to the desktop.  5. To change directory into the desktop, execute:       cd Desktop   6. To run isohybrid.pl on the ISO image, execute the following command, replacing [tails.iso] with the path to the ISO  image that you want to install:     perl isohybrid.pl [tails.iso] Do the copy ---> Execute the following command, replacing [tails.iso] by the path to the ISO image that you want to copy and [device] by the device name found in step 1: dd if=[tails.iso] of=[device] If you don't see any error message, Tails is being copied onto the USB stick. The whole process might take some time, generally a few minutes.  (If you get a ""Permission denied"" error, try executing the command with sudo) The installation is complete when the command prompt reappears. After the installation completes, follow the instructions ""Start Tails on Mac"" at https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/start_tails/index.en.html#usb-mac",""

I understand that chatting with ICQ, Jabber or TorChat (has TorChat even been updated in a year?! People really need to start talking about this. i would never use torchat considering the developer is AWOL last I knew, i might be wrong. however, there are possible DNS leaks with chatting, in which case public wifi would help preserve anonymity however a VPN would do a far better job. I run, what i would consider, a fairly security focused system.  i take my system from whonix, but i dont use whonix (because why trust it? and i dont like having to add his keys). Ive physically isolated and created a tor gateway from scratch with all the features i wanted out of whonix and some features ive added myself. On my host i have deniable encryption via TruCrypt's hidden OS feature. All software (very limited) is bought with anon VCC and was solely installed for this reason. I installed a HIPS (host intrusion detection system) and virtualbox with an OS that connects to the physical gateway via Ethernet from my host. I dont always use public wifi but i do use a VPN. So if anyone could tell me the security risks of not using public wifi it would be greatly appreciated.",""

This is my system if anyone can find a loop hole/fault/way I can be caught by doing this please let me know ASAP. So from the internet side of things I use ToR, Cyber Ghost (a VPN) and PGP for encrypting messages so i feel pretty safe and dont think i will be caught through this side of things. Then I am getting the mail sent to a random abandoned house just outside of my home town with a random name on the package so if customs pick it up it will not be able to be linked back to me at all. Can anyone see a way I can be caught by purchasing drugs like this? P.S I will never be buying quantities over 20g's at a time and I've heard that sometimes customs put a tracking device in the package and when it is opened it goes off and it will reveal my location so yes i know to open the package up way away from my house. Also would customs even bother looking into packages of under 20g's in Australia?

Weather or not this is more likely to raise suspicion I dont know.  Personally I'm not worried about signing for anything.. I never use my real signature/name and the way I see it is it could have been anyone in the house that signed for it so doesn't pin anything on me, its not uncommon for people to have things sent to friends/family's address so doesn't prove the parcel was even intended for anyone in the house. Most my orders were going to a shared house so take the 6 people living there and then take into account their friends and family, signing for a parcel addressed to the house but with a name you dont recognise doesn't sound unlikely.I've had 1 or two parcels that I didn't sign for but then when later checked the tracking online (yodel) it had been signed for by (I presume) the delivery driver. I really dont worry about the signature, seems like an outdated form of security and not one that I could see making a big difference if you was to get caught. Even the word signature is an exaggeration of its importance, a smiley faced scribble would be more accurate! On the plus side the 100g of weed I had ordered hadn't been shipped yet so I've managed to switch addresses!

""Tor installs a text file called torrc that contains configuration instructions for how your Tor program should behave. The default configuration should work fine for most Tor users. If you installed Tor Browser Bundle, look for Data/Tor/torrc inside your Tor Browser Bundle directory. On OS X, you must right-click or command-click on the browser bundle icon, and select ""Show Package Contents"" before the Tor Browser directories become visible. Tor puts the torrc file in /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc if you compiled tor from source, and /etc/tor/torrc or /etc/torrc if you installed a pre-built package. Once you've changed your torrc, you will need to restart tor for the changes to take effect. (For advanced users, note that you actually only need to send Tor a HUP signal, not actually restart it.) For other configuration options you can use, see the Tor manual page. Have a look at the sample torrc file for hints on common configurations. Remember, all lines beginning with # in torrc are treated as comments and have no effect on Tor's configuration.""",""

The website is very young, but profit is bigger month by month  What do you think about simple prepaid debit card, well bank just doesn't ask about my name, or any of personal data, so i have bank acc and receive money and no one could recognize me. I were using paypal but i removed paypal payment from website, i don't think that paypal would be happy cooperation with me  There is biggest tv streaming website in Poland called weeb.tvThey are exist for few years, many polish anti-piracy organizations tried to stop their business but without effect.I found in their rules one interesting line:(http://weeb.tv/rules) ""1.2.    Operatorem Portalu jest spÃ³Åka Fasunshi Limited z siedzibÄ w Hong Kong, China (zwana w dalszej czÄÅci ""Administratorem"" lub ""UsÅugodawcÄ"")."" What means: ""1.2. The Operator of the service is Fasunshu Limited Company based in Hong Kong, China (referred to as ""Administrator"" or ""Service Provider""."" They are resistant because they registered activity in China? How do you think how they receive money? They use among others ""Cashbill"" service which receives payment from users then push it to normal polish bank account on payment order. Maybe they use prepaid card as well? But i think it is impossible, their profit is reaching about even 100-200 thousand dollars per month (according to unofficial calculations).    I believe with my small so far earnings they will not try to destroy me at all cost, so registering any company abroad (out of jurisdiction) is nor necessary, but i would like to make that business safe as much it is possible.I know technicall side of the business, the legal side is a mystery for me so far  Referring to Romania, the provider assured me, the he will ignore any complains, but i will make another account with fake informations and move my website on it. It is never to be too careful, thanks for info.

If you happen to leave your computer open and a family member not knowing you are connected to Tor, decides to check their email, and some method of cookie tracking the adversaries were able to link your Tor identity with your family members email login, then you might have a problem.  If you want to have the best OpSec available, then ditch the idea of using your personal computer to do any deepweb surfing. Drop the idea of using Windows, and at the very least starting using Tails. If you want a bigger screen, hook up a vga cable to your monitor.

So perfect they quickly where invited private forums and such. These IDs were the best you can get, literally, because they came from LE. They pawned the whole thing off as an intelligence gathering opt, but the vast majority of IDs were never recovered. There are a few cases like this. Consider, Operation Fast and Furious, where the FBI ran guns into South America in order to track the subsequent sales and arrest ""bad guys"". This operation was a huge failure and most of the guns were never recovered. This. Evo should even be considered LE. Thats why encrypt your PMs, always. As for worrying about Vendors being LE, of course they might be, but think about it fiscally. Every operation needs funding and if the value of the arrest doesnt surpass the money spent their superior wouldnt sign off on the funding. usually its the vendors targeted for sting operations, not the other way around. But dont hang your freedom on it.

The only footing you have in plain sight is people CAN see that you are using TAILS, and that might look suspicious.  They can't see WHAT you are doing as long as decent security practices are taken, though.  Using TAILS, PGP, and good security aren't illegal in themselves, though.  On the other hand, using TAILS might be in violation of vauge clauses in employer contracts.  (Yes, some of us have encryption clauses in our job's contracts... sigh) or similar.  But, people can tell you are using Tor, too, so if you're using Tor, you might as well use TAILS.  I personally see little use in using VPN/SSH Tunnels unless you can aquire one very anonymously.  Maybe you can do that, but I've never looked deeply into it.  You have to assume: (1) The operator of the service is watching you. (2) The operator of the service the service itself is watching you. (3) So on.   When I say this, I mean you really need to consider what data is passing over what medium.   For example in your precise example, if I used TAILS to connect to TOR over hacked wifi, then relayed it to a SSH Tunnel, then from that tunnel, another nonencrypted socks5... It does not matter how many layers of encryption I put between me and the end point, if the end point itself isn't encrypted (for example, plain http), or any two points between, it is not very useful (except for *maybe* making it harder to find the source of said communication).  At any point if data is passing nonencrypted (and, I mean end-to-end), the operator(s) of any layers of the link between the origin and destination can be easily eavesdropped on.   I personally am a little worried everytime I see the MingW32 comment in people's PGP headers here -- it tells me they are using Windows to access Tor, and also that their keys are likely stored on non-encrypted storage.  I can only hope they used a reasonable passphrase and aren't easily talked into giving any of those passphrase(s) out. What worries me more is when Vendors change PGP keys -- you really should force them to sign their new key with their original key in a PGP message (which I've been lucky enough to have a Vendor do that, too).  But I was actually wanting to suggest a ""Last Updated"" in the PGP tab for Vendors. But back to the original question.. These are my rules:1) I use TAILS, and only TAILS.  Once I unplug my USB stick, there is zero physical evidence of what I may or may not have done except on the remote server(s) I interacted with, and my USB key which is well encrypted.  Nothing local in plain text. 2) Always use PGP. Always use PGP. I occasionally relax and send simple messages not over PGP, but for anything remotely sensitive, always use PGP.3) I get nearvous about my writing style being compared to known traces of my ""real"" online identity.4) I get worried when Vendors say ""PGP not required"".5) I'm really paranoid.  But for good reason.  Even day-to-day, I try to use TAILS but unfortunately it's just not that simple.  Using TAILS day-to-day makes it less suspicious looking when I actually use it for things that may be questionable to a jury of my peers.6) TAILS, Tor, etc. isn't an end-all solution for security.7) Always use PGP. No, seriously, always use PGP.  It's not hard.  Don't use Tor on Windows.  It's not extremely hard.  After a while, you may even find it easy.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- iQEcBAEBCgAGBQJTKm+eAAoJEG+LZ8lzO8N0R0kH/263oOKLhaCXRLfJd0dP4pR1GTMfxTT7kBJHy15Uam/Xwqc0x299Y445pAkCTjiBwg92ctYcpcQhzs6cdG5DXwXq3jfNLOgA1KPyaejeCnesqPf89s3HsAI8r6wYHOt0ZpftVUihpjWMCgHw0hNCCwTaNSLwAcsU0PzQ7h5PiaBwvU86/ctHJLfWaVCk/fy90Fjp706cux697U5Wwg+mPsM6Hk/WnJujjX+xhy4li6LBX/9b38EYzrDAYYi4WBNMZR+Q4ve5fG+fur8PZt9DT4Dh2tcCYcuNjNAN6AWKWoSmImtej963d2SCA3Cyw/sXI3x26D7CQtXK5F3uIBc38Jg==RJvi-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",""

It does not matter how many layers of encryption I put between me and the end point, if the end point itself isn't encrypted (for example, plain http), or any two points between, it is not very useful (except for *maybe* making it harder to find the source of said communication).  At any point if data is passing nonencrypted (and, I mean end-to-end), the operator(s) of any layers of the link between the origin and destination can be easily eavesdropped on.  I personally am a little worried everytime I see the MingW32 comment in people's PGP headers here -- it tells me they are using Windows to access Tor, and also that their keys are likely stored on non-encrypted storage.  I can only hope they used a reasonable passphrase and aren't easily talked into giving any of those passphrase(s) out. What worries me more is when Vendors change PGP keys -- you really should force them to sign their new key with their original key in a PGP message (which I've been lucky enough to have a Vendor do that, too).  But I was actually wanting to suggest a ""Last Updated"" in the PGP tab for Vendors.But back to the original question.. These are my rules:1) I use TAILS, and only TAILS.  Once I unplug my USB stick, there is zero physical evidence of what I may or may not have done except on the remote server(s) I interacted with, and my USB key which is well encrypted.  Nothing local in plain text. 2) Always use PGP. Always use PGP. I occasionally relax and send simple messages not over PGP, but for anything remotely sensitive, always use PGP.3) I get nearvous about my writing style being compared to known traces of my ""real"" online identity.4) I get worried when Vendors say ""PGP not required"".5) I'm really paranoid.  But for good reason.  Even day-to-day, I try to use TAILS but unfortunately it's just not that simple.  Using TAILS day-to-day makes it less suspicious looking when I actually use it for things that may be questionable to a jury of my peers.6) TAILS, Tor, etc. isn't an end-all solution for security.7) Always use PGP.No, seriously, always use PGP.  It's not hard.  Don't use Tor on Windows.  It's not extremely hard.  After a while, you may even find it easy.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----iQEcBAEBCgAGBQJTKm+eAAoJEG+LZ8lzO8N0R0kH/263oOKLhaCXRLfJd0dP4pR1GTMfxTT7kBJHy15Uam/Xwqc0x299Y445pAkCTjiBwg92ctYcpcQhzs6cdG5DXwXq3jfNLOgA1KPyaejeCnesqPf89s3HsAI8r6wYHOt0ZpftVUihpjWMCgHw0hNCCwTaNSLwAcsU0PzQ7h5PiaBwvU86/ctHJLfWaVCk/fy90Fjp706cux697U5Wwg+mPsM6Hk/WnJujjX+xhy4li6LBX/9b38EYzrDAYYi4WBNMZR+Q4ve5fG+fur8PZt9DT4Dh2tcCYcuNjNAN6AWKWoSmImtej963d2SCA3Cyw/sXI3x26D7CQtXK5F3uIBc38Jg==RJvi-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----"

LIke I said, there is merit in ""hiding in plain sight"" when using tor vs. plain open internet -- people can see you are using TAILS, Tor, or whatever else -- at least your ISP, anyone between you and the Tor exit node, and then even the end point themselves.  If you think this is a huge risk, then that's your circumstance, so don't do it.  But also remember, you can't access Evol or any Darknet market that I am aware of without Tor or I2P.  So you are already suspicious looking.   By not taking additional precautions, you are getting the worst of both worlds -- you are using Tor, and using Tor in a way that if alphabet soup kicks your door down, ... Are you sure you deleted that key?  That last message you accidently saved to disk?  That's where encrypted disks come in handy. What really amazes me is when Vendors don't require PGP.  Consider the circumstance: (1) Evol is a LE honeypot, or becomes one, or is otherwise siezed .. (2) LE sees your unencrypted communications -- or maybe through PrivNote and forces PrivNote to record and share information (3) LE gets BUYER address (4) LE intercepts inbound pkg to buyer, arrestes buyer (5) LE traces pkg back to zip code + timestamp.  Pulls video from timestamp.  LE either recognizes shipper (small town?), gets a plate/partial plate from parking lot footage, etc. The end result is the vendor is busted because of the buyer did not encrypt their address.  This is possible.  I'm sure it probably has happened at one point--maybe not on Evol--but overall, yeah, it's happened already.  This is why PGP is just stupid essential.  PGP gives no fucks about a subpenoa or what a Judge orders, it will NOT release data. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- iQEcBAEBCgAGBQJTKosTAAoJEG+LZ8lzO8N0OS8IALultagcRiLnz+9DHgir1HjhuicLqV6rC945IAq33B0JwjRebUwObREt9GN+r1MFoxICBXGp4Ez5yyUoyu7TcEIyRaoqihn6RynpwRyVz4PKOiiSob0w1TNDa8+IbNbcZUAtp6rMRgTwCGPCGDJbA0ofLOIbC6b6Jl6+vdRL7XpEdEVRFgO4atjJjAFw87jHUwZ+bg0GZI73Dgq5bUtYsbf5RcJnbFKELac8/srO3dDxEP601NP5/4IAxZlnah+67JkZoe/2cZ1CS+4HDcfaqiFPs1L/zSw5KBi4V0dwH3s3zryOS7gSVSdzipD07gfYlMZBsrXDYKS6ltLhoCpanes==BrQN-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","finesser wrote:nodseen wrote:[...snip...]i see your point but i think hiding in plain sight is more useful (at least imo) for fraud activitiesbut i do agree with you about not using tor on windows (which i am guilty of)"

As long as they delete whatever information they gathered and not share it with the 3 letter agencies there shouldn't be any reason to panic. The main targets seem to have been market owners and server locations for the markets. We dont know the full truth yet but here is some info There has also been over 600 arrests very recently of some scum paedos in the UK. At first it would seem that they have been caught directly because of this vulnerability/exploit and if we go by previous experiences that would make the DWM community the next targets like they did last time with freedomhosting and SR1 but if you read the details they were caught by other various LE methods like direct contact and social manipulation. I think they (GCHQ + NSA ect) want us to think they managed to catch these scum by using this vulnerability/exploit just to stir up the DWM community and cause some panic/fear, while i don't underestimate their skills, i don't think this is how they caught them. I may be wrong and its probably a good time to exercise some caution just incase.  I'm no expert on the whole subject and have been reading as much as i can to find out the details, if anyone knows any more share it with us.

You buy (you can buy off my listings soon as im preparing this right now )  but experienced carders will have own printer setup and you can print a PREPAID credit card template (depending on your country.. there is many.. VANILLA PREPAID VISA is a big one in north america) You get template and print EXACT  EXACT look of prepaid card Most prepaid say $25 $50 $100 $200  Make sure you template have layer to change the prepaid amount (very easy in photoshop if you know what you are doing )  Make the dump say $500-$1000 or whatever you planning to card...   Here is the tricky part.. DO NOT HAVE 100 of these on you.. have 1 to 2 most or be able to hide if you get pulled over.. but instore have 1 or 2 most     Lets say things go VERY VERY BAD and you get arrested..  this is how it will go...  Most cops wil be too dumb and be fooled themselves.   Have good story how you bought this card off ... craigs list or something of that nature.. even have burner number ready.. i promise no one really investigating for 1 dump Let cop know you didnt think you doing anything wrong as the dump checked out... looked very good and you had seller information if he tried to sell you used card (pretend its your fault you didnt check balance )  Thats it... you stick to that and this will happen... police wil release you after few hours .. or they will know your full of shit and will still charge you  BUT  i promise you this.. i in community long time and long time in this business in countries where justice system work 70/30 guilty favourite.. in america you must be 100% any doubt where maybe this actually happen to you .. guess what ..

Any company wont fight serious LE attention just to protect a random subscriber just as your isp wont.

You might handle company secrets that competitors or hackers could use to wreak havoc upon your company and steal from your customers. You might work in a conservative setting in which your sexual orientation or political views would subject you to negative stereotyping. Perhaps youâre a medicinal cannabis user in a state with hostile laws surrounding the issue. Attorneys, doctors and accountants constantly face frivolous lawsuits that could destroy their careers, while journalists documenting governmental abuses could find themselves in all sorts of trouble before they know it. Maybe you simply value discretion in your personal relationships and communications, and expect a reasonable amount of privacy in your daily life.The bad news is that obtaining such a measure of privacy is increasingly difficult, and uncommon, in todayâs technological landscape, and I have no turn-key solution for this problem. The good news is that I can provide several simple security measures that are easy to implement and go a very long way in defeating all but the most sophisticated intrusion attempts."

First of all, I've done my research, I have some opinions. But I'm sure a lot of you guys know better, and that's why I'm asking for help. And I know a lot of others might be in the same position with the same exact questions, so this post might be useful. First of all, concerning security, wich would be the best possible setup? Of course, regarding your opinion. I saw a lot of guys talking about TOR > VPN > SOCKS5. That would be the best option, plus it makes more sense. TOR gets your information trough the nodes and hides it, VPN never gets your real IP nor info plus your ISP doesn't know what you're doing, and then the SOCKS5 hide your IP and location, suiting the best for your need. Then some talk about VPN before TOR, wouldn't that be a shot in the foot? VPN gets your IP and info and being unlucky might get someone to know what you're doing trought the VPN. Plus the ISP knows you're using the VPN. Plus your data might get spoofed and even altered to get traced back to you. SOCKS5 in the end will only hide your IP/local. The TAILS website also talks about VPN being bad for security purposes wich might get TOR to be unsafe. Does that also aplies when using TOR > VPN? SOCKS5 in the end suits the best isn't that right? It is the most flexible way to get others to see what you want them to see, plus they don't give you much pain in the ass about any data being leaked right? So is TOR > VPN > SOCKS5 the best way to go? Now, regarding TAILS. Is it suitable to get that (TOR > VPN > SOCKS5) profile? It is a bit harder right? Any other good ways to avoid getting data leaked and being as much anonymous as you could get? Now for the most advanced users, I found some trouble setting up a VPN in tails, can someone lend me a hand on how to set up that TOR > VPN > SOCKS5 party on tails? And personaly I don't like things to be explained on how to do them, I do prefer to know why should I make them that way! If you guys have the time and will to explain it that way, and also starting a debate on that! I think it would be the best way to get the best results and opinions... I know I'm asking too much and probably a lot of users will come here saying that google is my friend. I have already done my research and I still got this issues. That's why I'm asking! And with the results I have found in mind it leads me to think that a lot of users might be in the same boat that I am! So, knowing that I'm asking for too much info I must of course apologize! But I am also sure that a post like this will bring a lot of info to the conversation, and will be also good for the community. If you guys don't mind, if I get all cleared up and all the questions answered, after I test and start running everything sweet and smooth I'll re-arrange the topic cleaning all this questions and making it a tutorial topic with Question/Answer squeme. It will surely enlight a lot of other users with the same exact questions! All that being said *and more than enough* thank you all for the pacience and hope you guys the best!

It's therefore irrelevant if the VPN keeps logs or not. The logs link just to your pseudonym, not your real identity. Tor protects you, not any VPN.And it's Tor which protects this site, not some crap of VPN that always has to comply with national laws and international treaties.

I haven't done anything with it yet and will never use anything other than public wifi. All I've done is made a USB with xubuntu 12.04 and whonix and am in the process of making one with qubes/whonix. It's not a mac so I don't have to worry about the mac addy, I'll probably never use the 8.1 host OS ever again, is it worth returning it?   I was just planning on carding 1K worth of stuff then selling it and buying another one. I've got a half decent CC-BTC (laundered a million times) method and an ATM in my city so It's pretty tempting to just let it pay for itself then sell it. It seems easier than all that shit. It was like a week or two ago now. I don't really care about selling it for $100 loss and buying another one if it's gonna come back to bite me in the ass, I'd just rather not go through the hassle.  Like I said, encrypted bootable USB's and public wifi is all I work off of. Probably half dozen to a dozen cards (from another country) and I've made 1k and I can sell it and the work I put into it wasn't a waste. I could just sell it right now too.

I'm not really that tech savvy I have never been big into computers. My question is, where the fuck should I start? like how should I decide which guide and security set up to go with? At first I was planning on using debian for my OS and installing tails and using VM and VPN and such. Now I have read a couple of guides on installing xunbuntu. I just got done reading this guide http://ba6i2qxajcioadj4.onion/showthread.php?tid=15 on TCFv2 and it speaks of running an encrypted Whonix VM bootable from USB. Every fucking method is different and I'm not sure which way to go. My activities so far have consisted of just browsing and posting but soon I plan on getting into some more heavy shit like carding and buying drugs once I feel I am competent enough. I guess I just want some guidance on what method would be easiest for a novice at computers to understand and set up with no fuck ups. You guys have any suggestions on what route I should take here? what OS to use? Best beginners guide. I'm trying to learn right so I make as few mistakes as possible. Also, I downloaded a couple files(guides)to my laptop that would surely be incriminating. And with all this posting I feel like I may have burnt my chances of being safe on this laptop forever so should I go get a new one before I focus too hard on my set up? Or is it possible to erase those files and still encrypt the laptop. Am I over thinking? feels like if i dont get this perfect Im gonna fuck myself over.

I can either load the second hard drive in my laptop which has Debian OS, which then connects through a VPN, and runs the dual Whonix VM solution (Gateway and Workstation), then from within Whonix I run a second VPN and use SOCKS5 proxies. Or, I can run my bootable USB drive containing Tails with a persistent partition so I have some extra programs, and from within Tails I use a VPN and SOCKS5 proxy. Sometimes I mix shit up and tunnel into my VPS servers. It's all a matter of personal preference really, find what works for you. What you ultimately need is for your DNS to not leak, having everything encrypted, and regular cleaning of data from the system if you're not using a live OS (like tails) as those hold everything in the RAM which is emptied upon losing power. ------- My suggestion - and take it with a grain of salt as there is no one way to do anything on the DN - is to DBAN your laptop regardless of buying a new one, to be as safe as you can the ultimate solution would be another computer. Just a second hand laptop of maybe the last 4-5 years, bought with cash in some form for better results, at least would cover various OPSEC scenarios. Mine can run my setup because it's an absolute beast  Even with a new laptop, DBAN it, install your OS of choice, then fully encrypt the drive(s). Do not connect it to the internet at any stage until you have everything setup the way you want it if you want to be safer again, and have the VPN setup ready to go when you do. If I think of something I've forgotten I'll edit this post.

You gotta make a new ID for yourself down here, don't do anything to link yourself back. Your fine if you did just start over new. Your IP changes every 10 mins down here.  Its best also to use a hard drive or computer that doesn't have any real ID stuff on it, in case you get infected with malware some how. Also eventually encrypt your drive if you start getting paranoid cause of all the cc #'s on it.

If you need to reroute, just configure an app's built-in proxy option to point to Tor or Privoxy.

THIS GUIDE IS A VERY DETAILED PDF GUIDE. i will also provide around the clock support with any questions you may have at all. you will need a socks for this method, but trust me its worth it! especially if you have a card with a high balance! it also works best with US cards which are very easy to get hold of. here is the link to my guide - http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/31649",""

How long does it usually take for the merchant to get notified that someone has committed fraud, and do these online merchants usually go after the people that have done it? 2. If the merchants decide to look into the fraud, won't they see the drop address and just tell the cops about it?? I know these might be dumb questions, but i want to cover all grounds before i start getting into this. I want to make sure i know as much as i possibly can so i won't make a dumb mistake. P.S. I truly appreciate everyone that has helped me and the other new guys so much. It is great to know that you guys don't have to take your time out to answer our questions, but you still do.

Depends on the card holder, if they monitor their accounts by their phone it could be minutes. If they are old and only get their statements every month then it could be weeks. Different circumstances for different cards. They can try and catch you but if you did your job properly they won't be able to. Plus who is going to go chasing for $100 2. Yes they could, but again unless you ordered 15 macbooks the police are hardly going to do anything about it. Make sure you don't card from home, use vpn's, use proxies, use vm's and use a burner laptop. The more disposable your environment is the harder it is to catch you.",""

I noticed there was no tutorial on the Wiki so here's one for the people who want to use it on nix systems via terminal.  This may be a tl:dr thread but hopefully someone finds it helpful. First off compiling GnuPG from source is not recommended for beginners and should be avoided if you don't know what your doing.  That being said it's not as user friendly as other programs but it's effective. Of course like always there's more than one way of doing things. This is mine so if you do it another way contribute to the community and let's get that Wiki filled.  First off install it on your system: sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install gnupg Now that's installed on your system it's time to generate and setup your keys. Remember your password! gpg --gen-key Follow the directions and make sure to put your username along with an e-mail(valid or invalid) Next, you will need to export your public and private keys. gpg --export -a ""User Name"" > public.key Also export your private key if needed. gpg --export-secret-key -a ""User Name"" > private.key It's important to store those files encrypted on your HD, encrypted on a USB or microSD card. Your choice. Truecrypt is your friend. Now that you have your public key you can give that out to whomever for communication.  Now it's time to send a message.First copy and paste the recipients public key into a file. Then: gpg --import FILE This imports the users public key into your public key ring so you're able to encrypt the message needed to be sent and so the user receiving the message can decrypt it with their private key. Now that you have added that user to your keyring you need to specify which user your going to send the message to. Open whatever text editor of your choice and type the message you would like to send. Don't save the document for obvious reasons.  Now,gpg --list-keys This displays the users in your keyring you can send message to. Find the user you want to send the message to and copy their e-mail address.  gpg --encrypt --armor -r ""e-mail of user you're sending msg to"" and hit enter. Now copy your text and paste it to the terminal.  When finished hit ctrl+d and the encrypted PGP message is there to now submit via PM or whatever.  You've sent a message to the right user and now you've received one. So copy the whole PGP encrypted message and paste it into a file.To decrypt:gpg -d FILE You will be prompted for your password here to fully decrypt the message. Once you've entered your password the message is displayed.  DO NOT USE sites like http://igolder.com/PGP/ as you're posting your private key along with your password.. Which is just silly.   If anyone uses a different method via terminal please add!! Reference:http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/

I live on a relatively private road, at the end of the road it starts going up this huge hill that has no outlet. The hill probably contains about 30 houses, at the bottom of the hill are all the mailboxes. So I noticed today one of the mailboxes is not being used, I opened it and it was infested with ants. It also has no address on the box. Could I just slap an address on the box and start having things mailed to there? There is no way the mailman could be suspicious because the mailbox isn't infront of any houses, so he would have no way of knowing what's going on with the house that box is addressed too. The only thing is, what would be the best way to go about compiling a fake number for this mailbox? Do you think they have on record the previous address for that mailbox? Do I need to get creative with this, or since the mailbox is so secluded from any houses will the mailman just deliver without thinking anything of it?",""

However I got one request asking to do it early, and I was kind of in need at the time which I went along with stupidly. I set everything up and said we would do payment later - This person then turned out to be the oldest square and boyscout in the book. He is staying in V but 2 hours before the show, rather than picking up from the hotel, calls them 3 times in 1.5 hours, to verify they are for him and ready to be picked up, becuase he will not travel. After calling the 3rd time, they got tired of the requests and then got suspicious. They called up to the processing department to double check EVERYTHING bc of him, and there was some sort of flag somehow, it had already been processed, but they put 2 together and called the CC company - who called original owner - who said no not authorized. They refunded and cancelled. Now I realize this might be a noob mistake, but im still looking for seriuos help so please bear with me -Then they contacted the guy who kept calling and said, this is fradulent, report it to the police if you want, we cant give them to you. So ofcouse the boyscout who will not walk down the strip until 15 minutes before showtime, drives out to the PD and gives them all the information, telling me about how good a samaritin he is. Gives them all emails, all texts - Now I was using a Gvoice number this whole time, and burner email. I stopped talking to him and 10 minutes later I get a text asking me about something else and I said 'yes' - then the next response is that 'this is Detective **' and that they are tracking my IP, im in contempt of court, Im going to be found and charged and jailed. I obviously cleaned out and deleted the entire account, however looking at the history login locations, I had been using the number through an APP, then through vpn on my phone, and the IP matched in my 'history' somehow to a real phone.  So is this something that is dangerous enough? Can they actually prosecute across state with my IP? Is this police or FBI? How long until they come to my door? Is it too late to cover my ass? I realize this is an amatuer mistake. It was small time and never had a problem until this jackass decides to be a good citizen. The hotel said they just cancelled everything and refunded the card right away. No transaction ever really went down, but it was still charged in the first place.

Increases like this usually do not happen in currencies with large market capitalizations without good reason. Before we get to that, Darkcoin is a privacy centric cryptocurrency, the first of its kind. Many traders still recall its astronomical rise to $15, or 5x what the current price is as of now. Through Masternode and Darksend, transactions are anonymized allowing people to send money truly discreetly. If you would like a more in-depth Darkcoin refresher, check out this article.  Masternodes, if you are not familiar with them, are essentially nodes like Bitcoins has with the difference being that Masternode users need 1000 DRK âas collateralâ as well that Masternodes receive rewards for funneling transactions. In the new wallet update of Darkcoin Core v.0.11.1, InstantX, the reason Darkcoin increased in price so much this week, was released. InstantX adds on top of the Masternode and Darksend features. â¦ Using InstantX will gain 5 Masternode-level confirmations within seconds from the network, then with an average of 1.25 minutes a 6th block-level confirmation will make funds spendable on most websites. When I talked to Fernando Guiterrez, member of the Dev DRK team, regarding InstantX and how it affect Darkcoin in both long term and short term, he said: InstantX opens a whole new set of possibilities to use Darkcoin and consolidates it as a source of innovation in the crytocurrency space. In the near term, most of the effect will be felt online. Activities as trading or gambling will be much faster, and we expect that more users will choose Darkcoin to perform them. In a longer term, InstantX will make using Darkcoin in brick and mortar businesses easier and more secure than any other alternative, including credit cards. All combined; InstantX should increase the adoption of Darkcoin in a dramatic way.The pace at which the network is updating is great and we have many safety mechanisms in place, so we do not expect any forking problem. While this shows that remaining private when sending money does not have to sacrifice for speed, it also solves a very practical problem of waiting 10 minutes for one confirm. While it had had a Band-Aid fix of accepting unconfirmed transactions, this is a risk some merchants cannot take. Also read: Interview with Evan Duffield, Winner of 2014 Proof of Honor Award  Darkcoin is one of the few coins that shows a real benefit of using over Bitcoin, versus just speculative trading. Offering instant confirmations within seconds is an impressive feat, even for cryptocurrencies.  While the price of Darkcoin is falling to normal prices once again, Evan and the rest of the team are not stopping on innovating. Darkcoin has a series of innovations under its belt such as the X11 algorithm that is popular with miners for its energy efficiency, Darksend and Masternodes, and now InstantX. The whitepaper regarding InstantX also alludes to potential new features, such as transaction locking that is mentioned many times. Time will tell what other innovations will come out for Darkcoin. For more information: InstantX Thread , InstantX Whitepaper What do you think of InstantX? Are you now interested in Darkcoin? What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments below!

PM me if you want explicit instructions. now the bad news - the VPS provider probably has a backup system in place that images the servers - this is in case of a crash they can restore user data (among other reasons) so that means there is probably a backup somewhere. i know on clear web they are images of the history of a page. it is a hacker trick to go back and go through these images to determine what patches have been applied, and from there deduce an attack vector to get in. on an onion site i don't think that is the case. but in any event it would be prudent to assume a backup exists. you may be lucky and your VPS doesn't get backed up. your next best option is to hope that the backup system is some kind of tape drive that gets recycled every couple of weeks, which means you backup will get overwritten. i don't like any of your choices. i hope this helps  popa",""

So I plan to go buy and use a bigger box that is not USPS brand (one that can still fit in the postal drop box). My questions are:   Can I use priority stamps for this box (I've heard stamps are only for envelopes)? If yes then how do I determine how much stamps is needed to ship the 6 oz?  And if using a non-USPS box do I need to put any other labels on the box to indicate that it's priority or would USPS already know that my package is priority since I'm using priority stamp(s)?  Sorry for the noob questions but I'm just trying to be safe/anonymous so any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

As for Linux, I'd look at OpenSuse and Ubuntu. This assumes by ""best"" you mean most ""secure by default""  Now if your really a day to day Windows user, don't feel you have to ditch the OS, especially if your very familiar with it. For real Windows users out there. Get on Windows 8.1 Professional, install an SSD like the Samsung Evo 850s. Enable BitLocker and use a long pass phrase. Install anti-keylogger software. Enable your screen save and set it to lock your workstation after a minute of inactivity.  Use password managers like LastPass or KeePassX to create and manage really complex passwords. Download the NSA Hardening Guide and the Checklist. Follow it. If your budget allows for it I strongly recommend building an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Security Onion Linux on a physical machine. Have a firewall and set rules for incoming and outgoing. Use Kali Linux and test the security. Scan for patches with openvas. Your VPN should be installed on the router. If host PC is fast enough and has the ram, run a VM of your favorite linux distro (like Whonix) in a hidden partition.  Don't stop with the OS. Think about your entire network and secure it from cyber attacks of all kinds. This is the Dark Net. Your LE isn't the only bad actors round here.

Privacy-conscious people rely on it to help cloak their identities and prevent websites from tracking their previous steps. Now, a software consultant has devised a simple way websites can in many cases bypass these privacy modes unless users take special care. Ironically, the chink that allows websites to uniquely track people's incognito browsing is a much-needed and relatively new security mechanism known as HTTP Strict Transport Security. Websites use it to ensure that an end user interacts with their servers only when using secure HTTPS connections. By appending a flag to the header a browser receives when making a request to a server, HSTS ensures that all later connections to a website are encrypted using one of the widely used HTTPS protocols. By requiring all subsequent connections to be encrypted, HSTS protects users against downgrade attacks, in which hackers convert an encrypted connection back into plain-text HTTP. Sam Greenhalgh, a technology and software consultant who operates RadicalResearch, has figured out a way to turn this security feature into a potential privacy hazard. His proof of concept is known as HSTS Super Cookies. Like normal cookies, they allow him to fingerprint users who browse to his site in non-privacy mode, so if they return later, he will know what pages they looked at. There are two things that give his cookies super powers. The first is that once set and depending on the specific browser and platform it runs on, the cookies will be visible even if a user has switched to incognito browsing. The second is that the cookies can be read by websites from multiple domain names, not just the one that originally set the identifier. The result: unless users take special precautions, super cookies will persist in their browser even when private browsing is turned on and will allow multiple websites to track user movements across the Web. Update: The latest version of firefox, 34.0.5, no longer allows HSTS Super Cookies set in regular mode to persist in private mode. Greenhalgh said this fix is recent and produced screenshots showing his PoC worked on version 33 of Firefox, at least when running on Windows. Firefox 34.0.5 continued to allow multiple websites access super cookies. Chrome on Windows remained fully vulnerable, as did Chrome and Safari running on an iPad tested by Ars. Internet Explorer isn't vulnerable because currently supported versions of the browser don't support HSTS.How it works For any one site, HSTS can be used to hold only a single binary valueâeither on or off. To work around this limitation, Greenhalgh strings together 32 sites, adds all of the ons and offs, and stores them as a binary number. The result is the ability to uniquely tag more than two billion individual browsers. To make it easier on the website, the decimal number he stores is converted into a base36 string, so 169ze7 is used to represent 71009647, or lm8nsf is used to represent 1307145327. Of course, a less scrupulous website could perform the same tracking in a way that was less transparent.Enlarge Once someone visits Greenhalgh's PoC page in normal browsing mode, the unique identifier will persist even when viewing the page with privacy mode turned on. What's more, other sitesâfor instance, this oneâwill be able to read the identifier, allowing the tracking of users across large numbers of websites. These abilities fly in the face of what most users have come to expect. Typically, turning on privacy mode prevents websites from reading any previously set cookies. And unlike HSTS Super Cookies, most standard cookies can be read only by the Internet domain that set them. Fortunately, except for people using the Safari browser on an iPhone or iPad, it's possible to flush the browser flags that make HSTS Super Cookies possible. All that's required is that before switching to privacy mode a user delete all cookies. Every standard browserâwith the exception of Safari on iDevicesâwill also flush the HSTS settings. (Unfortunately, these settings appear to be difficult or impossible to remove when using Safari on iPads and iPhones, Greenhalgh said.) He found no evidence HSTS flags set in privacy mode are carried over into normal browsing, meaning people who have visited a site only incognito are safe from the attack. HSTS Super Cookies are a good example of how the introduction of new featuresâeven those that provide much-needed security improvementsâcan turn into holes hackers can exploit. The whole point of HSTS is to ensure a browser always uses HTTPS when making subsequent visits to a website that supports the mechanism. Browser developers almost certainly wanted those flags to carry over from normal mode to privacy mode to ensure privacy-minded users received the benefit of this protection. Now that there's a viable way of using HSTS to uniquely identify these users, developers will surely rethink their decision, but their options may remain limited.",""

Introduction This guide covers a basic setup to protect online privacy and anonymity. Itâs appropriate for reliably circumventing Internet censorship and data retention by ISPs, and for reliably circumventing commercial tracking and behavioral marketing. It may be adequate for political dissidents in countries that respect human rights.  In this setup, the host machine reaches the Internet through a VPN service, with firewall rules to prevent leaks. The host runs VirtualBox, and there are multiple Linux workspace VMs to compartmentalize and isolate activity. Each Linux workspace VM initially reaches the Internet through the host machineâs VPN service. It then connects through a different VPN service, or through the Tor network, to reach Internet sites. There are firewall rules to prevent leaks. For Tor connectivity, the guide uses Whonix, which comprises Tor gateway and workstation VMs that are based on Linux (Debian). VirtualBox by default isolates resources (storage, memory and processing) that each VM is using, both from itself and from other VMs. Although the Linux workspace VMs (and the Whonix gateway VM) all use the host machineâs VPN connection through network address translation (NAT), VirtualBox doesnât permit VM-to-VM traffic in that arrangement. Linux workspace VMs (and the Whonix workstation VM) are also isolated from each other on the Internet, because they have different IP addresses and network latencies. Because Whonix isolates workspace and networking in separate VMs, it resists attacks that compromise or circumvent Tor and/or firewall rules. However, the VPN client running in each Linux workspace VM is vulnerable to such attacks. Even so, the VPN client running on the host is isolated, and so damage is limited. Setting Up VPN on Host Machine If youâre already using a VPN service, you can skip to the next step. If youâre not already using a VPN service, choose one and install the client following the providerâs instructions. For Linux, you can use the instructions below, in âSetting Up VPN on Linux Workstation VMâ. Unless youâve already set up firewall rules to prevent leaks, itâs prudent to do so. All traffic (including DNS queries) should go through the VPN tunnel, and there should be no Internet connectivity if the VPN connection fails. Also, just in case, DNS queries should use the VPN providerâs DNS server(s), or reliable third-party DNS servers, and not your ISPâs DNS servers. There are instructions below (in âInstalling and Checking VPN-Firewall on Linux Workstationâ) for using adrelanosâ firewall setup in Linux. For Windows, you can ask your provider, or use (for example) Comodo. For OS X, you can ask your provider, or use (for example) PF. tâs also prudent to test for leaks. There are instructions below (in âInstalling and Checking VPN-Firewall on Linux Workstationâ) for leak testing in Linux. The same approach applies in Windows or OS X, except for installing and configuring Wireshark. Installing VirtualBox This step is trivial. Download the version of VirtualBox for your host machine OS from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. For Windows hosts, install by executing the downloaded file. For OS X hosts, double click the downloaded file, and drag the app to the Applications icon. For Ubuntu hosts, open the downloaded package with Ubuntu Software Center, and install. For Debian hosts, use dpkg in a terminal. After installing VirtualBox, download the Extension Pack, and open it with VirtualBox to install. Thatâs it. With VirtualBox running, hitting F1 opens the user manual, which is excellent and comprehensive. Creating Linux Workstation VM Creating VMs is very easy, and section 1.7 of the VirtualBox manual (hit F1) explains it well. Itâs a two-stage process. First, you configure the new VM in VirtualBox. Second, you start the VM, and install the OS, just as you would on a physical machine. Linux is the best choice for a secure and private workstation VM. Itâs open-source and free, so thereâs no money trail linking you to a product ID. Ubuntu is a good choice for new Linux users. Itâs best to use releases with long-term support (currently 12 .04). For those who dislike the Unity desktop, Xubuntu and Mint (both based on Ubuntu) are good alternatives. Debian is arguably more secure, but not as user-friendly. First download the 32-bit (aka i386) installer image file for the Linux distro that youâve chosen. Then open VirtualBox, and click the New icon. Enter your desired VM name, and select the proper OS type (Linux) and version (Ubuntu for Ubuntu, Mint or Xubuntu) or Debian. Specify 1 GB memory to avoid disk swapping. If host RAM is limited, you can reduce it later. Use the defaults for virtual hard disk type (dynamically allocated VDI) and location, but specify at least 100-200 GB maximum size. The initial size of the virtual disk will be at most 5-6 GB. But with large maximum size, itâs very easy to accommodate unplanned growth. After reviewing the final summary screen, hit Create. Next, tweak the new VMâs settings. In the General/Advanced tab, leave Shared Clipboard and DragânâDrop set to Disabled (for security). Under System/Motherboard, change the boot order to Hard Disk, CD/DVD, and deselect Enable absolute pointing device. Under System/Processor, select Enable PAE/NX (if your host supports it). Under Display/Video, increase video memory to 128 MB (unless host RAM is limited). Under USB settings, deselect Enable USB Controller (for security). Now add the OS installer image. Under Storage, highlight the CD icon (named Empty) under IDE Controller. Then hit the CD icon to the far right of CD/DVD Drive, and select Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file. Navigate to wherever you put your installer image, and select it. Then click OK to exit the settings screen. Then double click on the new VM, and go through the install process. Itâs OK to accept all defaults. But you can select the encrypted LVM option for disk partitioning , if you like. Although whole-disk encrypted VMs may leave plaintext on host machines, thatâs better than nothing if the host is compromised while running. As the VM is rebooting after installation completes, click Devices in the main menu, highlight CD/DVD Devices, and select Remove disk from virtual drive. To get better VM performance, you may want to install VirtualBox guest additions (customized kernel modules). Guest additions also provide better display and mouse integration, and enable mounting host folders (aka shared folders) in the VM. However, some of the kernel customizations may reduce guest-host isolation, and using shared folders definitely does. Itâs a typical convenience vs security trade-off.   Ubuntu or Xubuntu will prompt you to install the guest-additions kernel-module package as additional drivers. If not, use the Settings menu. You can also install guest additions by clicking Devices in the VirtualBox menu, and then Install Guest Additions. But donât do both. Debian 7.10 automatically installs the guest-additions kernel-module package. Now reboot, use Update Manager to download and install updates, and let the system reboot again. Youâre done. Setting Up VPN on Linux Workstation VM These instructions are for OpenVPN-based services. For IPsec-based VPN services, follow your providerâs instructions. Avoid PPTP-based VPN services, because that protocol is extremely insecure. Start by setting up Network Manager with OpenVPN. Open a Terminal window, and run these commands: user@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpnuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo restart network-manager Then review your VPN credentials â certificates (*.crt) and keys (*.key) â and configuration files (*.conf or *.ovpn). Some VPN services provide configuration files with embedded credentials, with each of the credentials bracketed by corresponding [name] and [/name] tags. In that case, copy each of the credentials, and save as an appropriately-named text file. There may be as many as four credentials:      ca.crt    client.crt    client.key    ta.key All of these files should be downloaded via HTTPS, and kept private. You might want to avoid providers that donât use HTTPS for this. Establishing a VPN connection may also require a username and password, which may differ from the account name and password for the VPN serviceâs website. Some low-end services email connection username and password. In that case, immediately go to the providerâs website, and change the password. Virtually all VPN services provide a ca.crt (certificate authority) certificate. These certificates enable clients to verify the authenticity of VPN servers before connecting. Most VPN services also provide a client.crt (client certificate) and client.key (for unlocking and using the client certificate). Client certificates allow VPN servers to verify the authenticity of clients before accepting connections. A few high-end VPN services also provide a ta.key to enable TLS authentication, which increases connection security. Youâll also need other information from the OpenVPN configuration file. First, youâll need to choose the VPN server that youâll be connecting to. Avoid the United States, United Kingdom and France. Germany and the Netherlands are OK. Itâs probably good to avoid Eastern Europe, Russia, China etc, which might attract attention. Youâll need the IP address of the server, rather than the hostname, in order for VPN-Firewall (see below) to work properly. If you just have hostnames, you can get the IP address by running this command: user@ubuntu:~$ host hostname.that.you.have Second, youâll need to know the server port number and connection type (UDP or TCP). Itâs generally best to use UDP (unless youâre routing via Tor). Youâll also need to know the cipher type (from the cipher â¦ line) and whether LZO compression should be enabled (if you see comp-lzo). If cipher type isnât specified, use the Network Manager default. For VPNs that provide ta.key, youâll need to know the key direction, which is the number at the end of the tls-auth line (typically 1). Start the setup by copying all of the VPN certificate and key files to /etc/openvpn. Open a Terminal window, and run these commands: user@ubuntu:~$ cd /home/user/path-to-the-filesuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo cp ca.crt client.crt client.key ta.key /etc/openvpn/ Of course, edit the second command for the files that you actually have. Then open Network Manager, select the VPN tab, and click the Add button. Select OpenVPN as type, and click the Create button. Enter a short name for the connection, and the IP address of the server that youâll be accessing. The next steps depend on the configuration of the VPN service. There are three common VPN-configuration setups. Some VPN services (such as Private Internet Access) provide only ca.key, and require username and password for connection. For them, select Password as authentication type, enter your username and password, and click the CA Certificate button. In the Places window, click File System. Double click etc, and then double click openvpn. Finally, select ca.crt and click Open. Now click the Advanced button. In the General tab, check Use custom gateway port and enter the appropriate port number. If appropriate, check Use LZO data compression (typical) and Use a TCP connection (rarely appropriate unless youâre routing via Tor). If you know the cipher type, click Cipher in the Security tab, select the appropriate one, and click OK. Now click Save in the VPN window, and close Network Manager. Some VPN services (such as AirVPN) provide ca.key, client.crt and client.key, but not ta.key, and donât require username and password for connection. For them, select Certificates (TLS) as authentication type, and then specify User Certificate (client.crt), CA Certificate (ca.crt) and Private Key (client.key) as described above. Then complete the same steps in the Advanced window as described above, save the VPN configuration, and close Network Manager. Some VPN services (such as IVPN) provide ca.key, client.crt, client.key and ta.key, and also require username and password for connection. For them, select Password with Certificates (TLS) as authentication type, and enter your username and password. Then specify User Certificate (client.crt), CA Certificate (ca.crt) and Private Key (client.key) as described above. Complete the same steps in the Advanced window as described above. In the TLS Authentication window, check Use additional TLS authentication, and specify Key File (ta.key) and Key Direction (typically 1). Then save the VPN configuration, and close Network Manager. Now use Network Manager to establish the new VPN connection. Once it connects, verify that it works by visiting http://whatismyipaddress.com. If it doesnât connect, or doesnât work, recheck the configuration. Installing and Checking VPN-Firewall on Linux Workstation Install adrelanosâ VPN-Firewall scripts as described at https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall. You want the firewall (iptables rules) to load at bootup, so install both the firewall and init scripts. Reboot the VM, but donât reconnect the VPN via Network Manager. Check VPN-Firewall status by running the following in a Terminal window: user@ubuntu:~$ sudo service vpnfirewall status It should reply 0. Then verify that the VM has no Internet connectivity by trying to visit http://whatismyipaddress.com. If it connects, thereâs something wrong with the VPN-Firewall setup. Now use Network Manager to establish your VPN connection, and verify that it works by visiting http://whatismyipaddress.com. If it doesnât connect, recheck the configuration. If it does connect, test VPN-Firewall by killing the openvpn process (run sudo killall openvpn in a Terminal window) and verifying that the VM has no Internet connectivity. Then use Network Manager to reestablish the VPN connection, and verify that it works by visiting http://whatismyipaddress.com. Check your DNS servers by running the standard DNS test at https://www.grc.com/dns/. It should report only the DNS servers that your VPN service is pushing. It should not report any DNS servers that are associated with your ISP, or are specified by your LAN router. If it does, thereâs something wrong with the VPN setup. You can also check for leaks using Wireshark. To install Wireshark, open a Terminal window in the VM, and run these commands: user@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get updateuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install wireshark Then configure wireshark to allow a non-root user to sniff packets. As described here, run these commands in a Terminal window: user@ubuntu:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-commonuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo adduser $USER wireshark Reboot the VM, and establish your VPN connection. Then open Wireshark, and start capturing on eth0. Use Firefox to check http://whatismyipaddress.com, run the DNS test at https://www.grc.com/dns/, etc. Now stop the capture, and run Statistics/Endpoints. You should only see one non-private aka public IP address, that of the VPN server that youâre connected to. Now kill the openvpn process (run sudo killall openvpn in a Terminal window) and start a fresh capture on eth0. Verify that Firefox canât see anything. VPN-Firewall blocks pings, by the way. Stop the capture, and run Statistics/Endpoints. You should only see traffic with local private IP addresses, and reconnection attempts from the VPN server that you were connected to. Finally, reestablish the VPN connection in Network Manager, and verify that itâs working. Then start Update Manager, download and install updates, and let the VM reboot. Installing Whonix Whonix comprises a pair of Debian VMs: a gateway VM that connects to the Tor network, and a workstation VM that connects through the gateway VM. Installing Whonix is easy. Start by downloading Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation to your host machine, using your VPN service. Itâs best to verify the downloads as instructed using the OpenPGP signatures and the Whonix signing key. If you canât be bothered with that, at least download them using BitTorrent (which is more secure, as explained). Import the gateway and workstation VMs, using File / Import Appliance in VirtualBox (reinitializing MAC addresses). If youâll be using just one Whonix instance, just start the Whonix gateway, and then the workstation. Download and install updates as instructed. After rebooting both VMs, youâre done. Enjoy! If youâll be using multiple Whonix instances, each gateway and workstation VM must have a unique name (which determines the name of its folder). After importing the first pair of gateway and workstation VMs, edit their names in the VirtualBox GUI, adding a unique suffix (or whatever) to distinguish them from others that youâll be importing (and to facilitate keeping track of them). Also, the gateway and workstation VMs of each Whonix instance must share a uniquely named internal network. First edit the settings for Adapter 2 of the gateway VM (under Network). Change Whonix to Whonix-1 or whatever. Donât change the settings for Adapter 1. The default (âNATâ) will have it connect through your hostâs VPN service. Then edit the settings for Adapter 1 of the workstation VM, changing Whonix to whatever you just used for Adapter 2 of the gateway VM. Now start the first Whonix gateway, and then the workstation. Download and install updates as instructed. After rebooting both VMs, youâre done. Enjoy! Source : https://www.ivpn.net/privacy-guides/advanced-privacy-and-anonymity-part-2

Hello. After reading a thread on users supporting the use of igolder, I realized that this community and a few others need to know how to properly encrypt their messages so they don't compromise their security for a ridiculous reason. This was previously posted on the hub but am now putting it here for the sake of helping the members in this community. I have noticed a lack of proper tutorials on how to use PGP/GPG. I also noticed that the ones which did exist focused on using a GUI application. As an alternative this tutorial will describe the in's and out's to securely and easily using PGP/GPG to encrypt communications, using a terminal interface, so one can maintain anonymity on tor and make sure only intended parties read the messages created. This is a guide on how to encrypt messages via the Gnu Privacy Guard, and does not detail the inner workings, nor signing.  ===Terminology===First and foremost, there are two different common forms of asymmetric encryption on the deep web that is mentioned; PGP, and GPG. both are more or less the same thing.  PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. GPG refers to the more trusted GnuPG, which stands for GNU Privacy Guard.As stated earlier, the two are considered very similar to one another, differing mainly in development and trust. This guide recommends the use of GnuPG, and will be using it. A keypair is the combination of public and private keys that form your ability to securely send messages. Your keypair will consist of your public key; the one you share with everyone else, and your private key; the one you keep to yourself and never distribute. ASCII Armor is the use of ASCII characters to display the encrypted data instead of using a .gpg file. This is desirable when sending messages using PM systems.  ===Installation===This guide will be using GnuPG, it can be downloaded from the following link (WARNING: CLEARNET LINK) https://www.gnupg.org/index.htmlIf you are running TAILS, GnuPG should already be installed. Once there, go ahead and download a stable release for the OS of your choosing. The application comes with GUI applications, and you are welcome to install them, but throughout this guide we will be using the terminal/command line instead. You can test to ensure the installation was successful by opening a terminal/cmdPrompt and typing the following command: A large amount of text including command arguments should display itself on the console, this indicates the installation was successful. ===Generating a keypair===Before we can encrypt a message, we are going to need to generate a keypair. You only need to do this once. to do this, enter the following command: The following text will then be prompted: The main difference between RSA & DSA and Elgamal is the underlying mathematical principles, for this guide we'll be using RSA. Enter 1 and hit enter. Next prompt: Technically you should be safe at 2048, but I would recommend the use of 4096 for the added security. Next prompt: In the world of privacy, permanent anything is usually looked down upon, so I would recommend setting some length of time. For this tutorial my key will last for 1 year. To do this I enter 1y. Next prompt: I entered y, as it was the correct amount of time. The next prompt will ask for each of the following one at a time. The only field you actually need to fill out is real name. In that category put whatever you want. The Email address and comment are optional. Modification options are given, but I'm satisfied with my entry, so I entered O to progress further. You will then be presented with a prompt to enter a passphrase. Pick a good one and move on. You will then be presented with the following message: Basically hit a bunch of keys on your keyboard, and click around a bit until it finishes generating random information. Once done, you should receive some form of confirmation, and return to the console. At this point you will have successfully generated a keypair that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. ===Getting your public key===At this stage you now have your own keypair; the next step is to retrieve your public key so you can distribute it for others to use when messaging you. In this tutorial, we created a user under the ID of WhatEverNameYouWant. This is the ID which I shall use. To print the key, enter the following command: where WhatEverNameYouWant is the ID or Email picked when creating the keypair. This will print the public key to the console screen, if you want it instead to save it to a file the following command can instead be entered: Where myPubKey.asc is the name and directory path of the file to save it to. This can be opened with a text editor, and the public key can be copied. Here is the WhatEverNameYouWant public key that it displayed: ===Importing someone else's public key===To encrypt a message for someone, you're going to need to import their public key. Like generating a keypair, you only need to do this once. For this tutorial I will be importing the public key provided on Agora's help and info page. You are more than welcome to import the public key displayed earlier. The first step is to copy the public key to a text file. Once that is done, enter the following command:  where pubkey.asc is the file where you saved the public key you want to import. Here's the output you should receive: And that's it, you can now write messages using the key imported. ===Encrypting a message===Once you have imported someone else's public key, you can encrypt a message. For this tutorial, I will use the text Hello World! and place it into file myMessage.txt .Now that we have a file with a message in it, enter the following command: where myMessage.txt is the name of the file you are encrypting. Throughout this tutorial, there has been use of other parameters before encrypting the message. Let's take a minute and examine the parameters set forth. Notice that we use --encrypt and then the file name to specify the file to encrypt, but there are a few other parameters not fully described.--armor tells the program to use ASCII armor, this makes GnuPG encrypt the data in the file so it can be copied and pasted via text characters.--output enables the user to specify a name and location of the output file, where encMessage.asc is the desired name of the output file.  So once that command is input, the user will be prompted to enter a recipient. As seen earlier, the user ID for Agora was Agora One. So that is what I entered. Alternatively, the user's email can also be entered. After that, I simply hit enter to confirm no other recipients.This is what the console looked like:  I just added this key from agora, so I am well aware that it is the actual user ID, therefore I can trust it, and input y and preceded on. Needing no other recipients, I simply hit enter and let the program compile an encrypted message.  Upon completion, the file encMessage.asc was generated. When opened with a text editor, the PGP message was shown. This is the message which I would send to the recipient, in this case it would be the Agora staff. ===Decrypting a message===So at this stage you can now generate your own keys, and send messages to others using their keys. The only thing left is to decrypt a message when a user messages you. This is the text Hello World! when encrypted using the WhatEverNameYouWant public key: Decrypting this is a relatively painless and simple process. First I saved the message to a text file titled myEncMessage.asc. Once there I entered the following command: where myEncMessage.asc is the name of the file with the message in it. This command will have it output the message into the console, if you want it to be placed into a file instead, use the following command: Where myDecMessage.txt is the name of the file to export the message to. The decryption process requires accessing the private key; for this reason, you must provide the password you created when generating the keypair. During the process a prompt will appear, fill in the password and it will decrypt. Here is the output of the command with no output file specified: Notice how a recipient is never specified, this is because the ciphertext can be linked to a key automatically. If the user has a message and the appropriate key to decipher it, GnuPG will find it on it's own. ===Kudos===Here are a few extra useful commands that the GNU Privacy Guard provides: This command lists all public keys stored on the machine. This command will do the same, but with private keys. If you want to change a key to a trusted one, enter the following command: The following will then appear: I enter the command trust which takes me to the prompt asking to set the trust level. I created the key, so there's no reason other than to trust it to its fullest extent, therefore I selected 5. And that's that. ===Wrapping Up===This tutorial taught the fundamental usage of using assymetric encryption via a terminal/command prompt. Although more time consuming and tedious, I consider it advantageous over a graphical user interface. Using a GUI such as kleopatra for windows enables the user to see keys and click to interact with them, however it imposes restrictions such as forcing the user to enter an Email address. Using a terminal also ensures you know exactly what is happening to the keypair, and have full control. There's positives and negatives to using both.

As I used and subsequently followed the trial of Ross Ulbricht, I identified the major problem of hidden markets asÂ : -Sellers have buyers' ID and/or address  It seems pretty obvious, since you need to send the package to your customer. However it allowed, and allows, sellers to have big databases of customers' addresses. I a seller gets caught, LEA has access to all of this. Â«Â WorseÂ Â», as we have seen with SR1, a seller can blackmail people with such a list. Of course the obvious way to deal with this is to ask sellers and buyers to communicate via encrypted tools, and to delete all their communications once the deal is done. But we all know it is based on the users' will, and thus isn't always followed...  It got me thinking about a service I'll call PlanetExpress or PlanEx.  Here's how it works. PlanEx is a physical location. It has a website where drug buyers can create an account, entering their address. Once they have an account, they generate a unique and single-use identifier. When they buy drugs here, they don't give their address or name to the seller, they give PlanEx's address and their identifier. The seller puts bot PlanEx's address and the buyer's identifier on his package, and sends it.  When PlanEx gets the package, they relabel it and send it to the buyer.  The unique identifier is destroyed from PlanEx's database immediately, so that the only record PlanEx has is the buyer's address, which isn't linked to any identifier/transaction.   Now, this would cost more than traditional postage, that's for sure.  However, it is a great way to anonymize postal services in my opinion, and prevent people from LEA's investigations (and this is true for all purposes, not only drugs)  What do you thinkÂ ? Would it solve the problemÂ ? Is it feasibleÂ ? Would you use such a serviceÂ ?   All the best, Keep up the good work guys Hubert",""

I'm thinking about using TOR & VM(Whonix) aswell but don't really know how to setup them.  TOR->VPN->Socks 5->VM1->VM2-> Internet In this case, there would be 2 VMs with Whonix.

One such technology is Tor, which employs a networkof Internet relays to hinder the process of attribution. Though advocates at the Electronic FrontierFoundation openly claim that âTor still works[1]â skepticism is warranted. In fact anyone riskingincarceration (or worse) in the face of a highly leveraged intelligence outfit like the NSA would be illadvisedto put all of their eggs in the Tor basket. This is an unpleasant reality which certain privacyadvocates have been soft-pedaling. The NSA Wants You To Use Tor Tor proponents often make a big deal of the fact that the NSA admits in its own internal documents thatâTor Stinks,â as it makes surveillance more work-intensive[2]. What these proponents fail to acknowledgeis that the spies at the NSA also worry that Internet users will abandon Tor: â[A] Critical mass of targets use Tor. Scaring them away from Tor might be counterproductiveâ Go back and re-read that last sentence. Tor is a signal to spies, a big waving flag that gets their attentionand literally draws them to your network traffic[3]. Certain aspects of Tor might âstinkâ but ultimately theNSA wants people to keep using Tor. This highlights the fact that security services, like the FBI[4], havedeveloped sophisticated tools to remove the veil of anonymity that Tor aims to provide.For example, the Washington Post reports[5]: âOne document provided by Snowden included an internal exchange among NSA hackersin which one of them said the agencyâs Remote Operations Center was capable oftargeting anyone who visited an al-Qaeda Web site using Tor.â Itâs well known that Tor is susceptible to whatâs called a traffic confirmation attack (AKA end-to-endcorrelation), where an entity monitoring the network traffic on both sides of a Tor session can wieldstatistical tools to identify a specific communication path. Keep in mind that roughly 90 percent of theworldâs internet communication flows through the United States[6], so itâs easy for U.S. intelligence todeploying this approach by watching data flows around entry and exit points[7]. Another method involves âstainingâ data with watermarks. For example, the NSA has been known tomark network traffic by purchasing ad space from online companies like Google. The ads cause webbrowsers to create a cookie artifact on the userâs computer which identifies the machine viewing thead8. IP addresses may change but the cookie and its identifiers do not. De-cloaking Tor users doesnât necessarily require a federal budget either. According to a couple ofresearchers slated to speak at Black Hat in a few weeks[9]: âIn our analysis, we've discovered that a persistent adversary with a handful of powerfulservers and a couple gigabit links can de-anonymize hundreds of thousands Tor clientsand thousands of hidden services within a couple of months. The total investment cost?Just under $3,000.â Client Network Exploitation (CNE) Trumps Crypto Back in 2009 security researcher Joanna Rutkowska implemented what she dubbed the âEvil Maidâattack to foil TrueCryptâs disk encryption scheme[10]. By compromising the Windows boot environmenther team was able to capture the hard diskâs encryption passphrase and circumvent TrueCryptâsprotection. While users can [usually] defend against this sort of monkey business, by relying on a trustedboot process, the success of the Evil Maid attack underscores the capacity for subversion to trumpencryption. This type of client-side exploitation can be generalized for remote network-based operations. In anutshell, it doesnât matter how strong your network encryption is if a spy can somehow hack yourcomputer and steal your encryption passphrase (to decrypt your traffic) or perhaps just pilfer the datathat they want outright. Enter the NSAs QUANTUM and FOXACID tag team. QUANTUM servers have the ability to mimic websites and subsequently re-direct user requests to a second set of FOXACID servers which infects theuserâs computer with malware[11]. Thanks to Ed Snowden itâs now public knowledge that the NSAâs goal isto industrialize this process of subversion (a system codenamed TURBINE[12]) so it can be executed on anindustrial scale. Why go to the effort of decrypting Tor network traffic when spies can infect, infiltrate,and monitor millions of machine at a time? Is it any wonder that the Kremlin has turned to old-school typewriters[13] and that German officials haveactually considered a similar move[14]? In the absence of a faraday cage even tightly configured airgappedsystems can be breached using clever radio and cellular-based rootkits[15]. As one user shrewdlycommented in an online post[16]: âUltimately, I believe in security. But what I believe about security leaves me far from thecutting edge; my security environment is more like bearskins and stone knives, becausebearskins and stone knives are simple enough that I can *know* they won't dosomething I don't want them to do. Smartphones and computers simply cannot providethat guarantee. The parts of their security models that I do understand, *won't* preventany of the things I don't want them to do.â Software is hard to trust, there are literally thousands upon thousands of little nooks where a flaw canbe âaccidentallyâ inserted to provide a back door. Hardware is even worse. Denouement About a year ago John Young, the operator of the leaks site Cryptome, voiced serious concerns in amailing list thread about the perception of security being conveyed by tools like Tor[17]: âSecurity is deception. Comsec a trap. Natsec the mother of secfuckersâ Jacob Appelbaum, who by the way is intimately involved with the Tor project, responded: âWhatever you're smoking, I wish you'd share it with the groupâ Appelbaumâs cavalier dismissal fails to appreciate the aforementioned countermeasures. What betterway to harvest secrets from targets en mass than to undermine a ubiquitous technology that everyonethinks will keep them safe? Whoâs holding the shit-bag now? For activists engaged in work that could getthem executed, relying on crypto as a universal remedy is akin to buying snake oil. John Youngâs stancemay seem excessive to Tor promoters like Appelbaum but if Snowdenâs revelations have taught usanything itâs that the cynical view has been spot on.

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","18450","2014-08-02T03:06:26","Re: ""The NSA wants you to use Tor""","Security & Anonymity","Bruce Schneier - probably the most respected crypto-analyst outside of the NSA. for crytoanalysts about the only place to work is for a 3 letter agency. this was an excellent post and marshalls a strong case for the weaknesses of TOR. if you look at the overall perspective of LE they are far outnumbered by so called bad guys. security involves far more than TOR. if you sell drugs you have to worry about your local narc dept. it was amusing that recently the DEA said they were going to stop enforcing some marijuana laws because they no longer have the money in the budget to continue the operations. i can only take that to mean that it was a never a moral issue at all, just one of funding. if you look at the big picture you will understand that the NSA is interested in bulk surveillance, not individuals unless they have a specific reason - terrorism or whatever. Schneier was the one who 'translated' the Snowden documents for Greenwald, so that the published articles could make sense to the layman. Schneier states openly that if the NSA wants your box, then they can own it. he describes in detail one whole section of the NSA that does nothing but maintain a database of individual computers and what expoits can be used against them if necessary. but they are very careful about launching such an attack and most people on here are not in their sights. i read a 14 page scientific article (unfortunately i don't have the exact citation) by a couple of guys in Luxembourg who set out to expose the location of TOR hidden services (more precisely the servers that they run on) they did this by using a PC with 96 GB of RAM which they described as an average workstation - and they leased 1000 (either S1 or s2) VPS from Amazon for a month and for a cost of under $3000 they were able to pin down the location of a number of sites of origin of TOR services. the scare after SR and FH compromises and the revelation that 4 TOR nodes that were identified as being registered to SAIC in Falls Church, VA (a front for CIA that offer me a job in the early 80's) which were then tracked back to NSA boxes. in accordance with the theme of the above post, this may well have been leaked on purpose. i remember when NSA was based off to the right of the Expressway in DC that you took after crossing the 14th st bridge. average citizens had never heard of the NSA - everybody in NoVa knew where the CIA headquarters are located in Langley (i have been in that building numerous times as well). they actually have a bulletin board in there that lists what companies are going to be awarded large govt contracts, so employees could buy stock in them. to everyone else that is insider trading. now that guy Alexander (recent head of NSA) has been nailed selling classified info through his consulting company to the tune of $1 million a month. the point i am trying to make is that no computer system is safe. it now possible for a guy with a cellphone to pick up the  decryption of data on a computer up to 15 feet away by listening to the frequency changes of the tones emitted by the CPU as it processes the data. there also have been reports of hardware manufacturers (Intel for example) having embedded back doors into their CPU chips. there are reports of Microsoft having back doors into Windows. i personally know tactics that will allow me to get into any windows box (without tools like ERD or locksmith) - if i have access to the box. every since the advent of the telephone there have been concerns about privacy. in fact a Supreme Court ruling in the 20s held that wiretapping was not only perfectly legal but to be expected. it wasn't until decades later that the idea of a right to the expectation of privacy even became a topic of discussion. i still remember party lines where could listen in on your neighbors' calls. when the NSA was in SE DC back in the 70's all the phones were just beginning to switch over to packet switched relays, rather than the old electro-mechanical switches where an electromagnet actually had to flip the switch over to complete the connection (for billing as well - which was a flaw we took big advantage of since it created about 3/4 second delay in completing the connection which was enough time to change the impedance on the line so that it appeared to phone company circuity that the phone was still ringing and no charges would accrue - aka the Black Box) but the NSA then recorded all international calls (which wasn't hard because they were all on undersea cables) satellite phone calls were yet to come. in fact if you made an international call you had to call an operator (are there even such a thing anymore?) and they would place the international call for you and about 10 minutes later they would call you back with your connection. it costs about $5.00 a minute which was a ton when minimum age was about $2.50/hr. but the NSA had complicated algorithms then that analyzed reel to reel tapes for certain key words to determine if there was something needing closer examination.  they had 50,000 workers then. that is no different than what they do today - only the technology is more complicated. i recently looked at a white-hat hacker class from Udemy that normally was $199 but for some unexplained reason they offered it to me for free. actually that's about what it was worth. but one of the 45 lectures was on darkweb and they had ppt presentation that showed a pie chart where the clearweb only accounts for less than 1% of the total internet. they had another graphic showing the internet as an ocean and the clearweb was on a shelf like close to shore and suddenly dropped off into the deepweb. they had porn way down at the bottom of the ocean but it had like a cork that was connected by a line to the surface (clearweb). anyway it is easy to raise alarms about TOR and there are valid concerns, but you have to remember that agencies like CIA  use it to communicate with moles in venues where carrier pigeons aren't an option anymore. one of its main design purposes was for use by dissidents or reporters to be anon in areas with repressive regimes, like N. Korea or even China. i posted a link the other day where Putin is offering $110,000 booty to crack TOR because hordes of Russians are flocking to it. the more people that use it the more anon it is and if people running servers move them around often enough they cant be pinned down. LE can always get lucky. my wife's grandmother was a big bridge player, and one of her favorite expressions was 'a peak is better than a finesse anyday', generally followed by the directive 'breast your cards'. it's a cat and mouse game for sure, but most people get brought down by the old fashioned rat - not technology. shit - the DEA couldn't even decode Iphone SMS messages. a few years ago (about 10 now) my partner got caught up in a gambling bust by state police (there was coke too) anyway he owned a bar and didn't want to run the book out of the bar so he put the phones on call forward to his son in law's business across the street from the bar. they had wiretaps, but they never even figured out the call forwarding. be smart, be safe, and move around.",""

That benefits not only us, but also them. so far the arrests and exploits have been through old sleuthing work and firefox vulnerabilities, not tor exploits. The only tor ""exploit"" is not so much an exploit as it is, that a fed has to own the node you happen to be assigned, thereby intercepting all inherent traffic. oh also I am friends with the co-founder.

Issue 1: Bridges.Problem: When I input my bridges I get a 'sock disconnect' error, or something similar I forget.

I store the Electrum seed as a password in KeepassX, and then each time you start up Electrum you restore your wallet from the seed. It's safer this way really, for similar reasons that Battalion in this thread is saying he likes encryption within encryption. With my Electrum method your wallet and configuration isn't stored after you shut down, it's re-created each time you need it. And the seed is safely stored, encrytped, in KeepassX.

Add a new socks proxy with the hostname set to proxy-nl.privateinternetaccess.com port 1080. Your authentication credentials are not the same the ones you use to login to your account, they are separate credentials that you generate in the account area for socks/pptp/l2tp. After you have configured your proxy, go to proxification rules and choose the proxy you created as the proxy for the default rule.  Make sure you create another rule specifying tor.exe to have a direct connection. Also don't forget to check the resolve hostnames through proxy setting in the name resolution menu for DNS leaks.

PSA: CHANGE YOUR STEALTH","Security & Anonymity","OK so I used to be a relatively large bulk MDMA importer, receving most of my product from Belgium. Right before the take down of SR2 there was a large amount of seizures that happened with packages leaving Beligum, usually success rate was over 99% but suddenly it dropped to much less than that. I ended up getting fucked out of alot of money. Something I noticed was that the bulk vendors weren't changing their stealth very often, so what I believe happened was that Customs started profiling the outside of the packages coming from these (multiple) bulk vendors and then ripping them apart and finding large quantities of drugs. It would be very simple for them to do this: all they have to do is place one order from the bulk vendor, then profile the outside of the package and leave a note for Customs officers to be on the look out for these particular types of packages. On top of the outside of the package they could also profile them by exact weight (ie. all 100g packages weigh almost exactly the same amount [100g+packaging weight] which could be used to profile packages by weight as well as appearance.) Anyway this is mostly a message for the big international vendors and vendors shipping out of sketchy countries: CHANGE YOUR STEALTH OFTEN! It's only a matter of time before LE start profiling your packages. At best, they only seize your product. At worst, your customers start getting CDs and they are one step closer to busting your ass. It might require a bit of creativity but changing your stealth is the best way to insure that your packages make it to the customers safely and consistently, and the cops don't get too hot on your trail. Your packaging is really the only clue they have as to where the drugs are coming from and going to. If they know what your packages look like they know who sent them (your vendor account), they know what to be on the look out for (your packaging), and they know where they are going (your customers drop). Being lazy and using the same stale stealth is VERY dangerous for your customers, don't let your laziness put other people's freedom in danger, and your business in the can. Get creative with your stealth and be fresh!  Anyway just thought I'd drop a little PSA and raise awareness that Customs does in-fact catch on to your stealth after so long, no matter how slick you think it is. (trust me those bulk MDMA vendors had some slick ass stealth and it still got profiled because it was stale) Obviously the bigger vendors should be changing their stealth ALL the time, because they are at the highest risk of being profiled by LE. While the smaller vendors should be doing it every once in awhile just to be safe.",""

I simply have got the time to do it, I am busy carding and with other issues IRL, and I don't feel I am doing the service or myself justice if I carry on offering it  However I have decided to share the Method that I use to do this, so that you can open AS MANY accounts in AS MANY names as you want. The guide is an introductory price of Â£49 for the 1st 5 buyers, it will then go to a standard price of Â£99. 20 will be sold in total. The price is an absolute steal for the value & potential of what you can do with these accounts  If you are still using crappy Polish IBAN cards with low limits to cash out (Â£130 per day at the ATM?!?), which are no longer guaranteed to work with Paypal and do not solve the problem of verifying a Bank Account to setting up Direct Debits which are both needed to properly verify your Paypal Account and cash out Big amounts then these Accounts are for you, they are a LOT better, much bigger limits - Â£500 per day at the ATM, Â£15k per day Bank Trasnfer limit etc  The guide is a 5 Page PDF which is very detailed and guides you the whole way through the process, with all the tips & tricks I have picked up to make sure you are instantly verified without any additional ID checks and you will get your card & PIN within 3-5 days   [WHAT YOU GET] *Sort Code*Account Number*Mastercard (pre paid) with Â£500 daily ATM limit*Account is in a Business Name of your choice, with the name of the fulls used (your or mine up to you)*Account is able to make & receive faster payment transfers*Account is able to have direct debits set up*Once you have it opened you can also get Â£250 overdraft (once they see there is cash running through it)*Mastercard has the Business Name on the front as well as the persons name who the account is opened in (gets you into trade only warehouses etc to buy wholesale)*Full Internet Banking Access  [ACCOUNT LIMITS] *Bank/Wire Transfer - Â£15,000 per day*Standing Order - Â£15,000 per day*Cash (paid in) - Â£5,000 per day*ATM (cash out) - Â£500 per day*Single Transaction - Â£10 per day   [WHAT YOU CAN USE IT FOR - This is just a few ideas and what I know it CAN be used for, I;m sure there are a lot more] *DOUBLE Verify Business Paypal Account (verifies as a Credit Card and Bank Account separately, Paypal sees them as unconnected)*Verify Merchant Accounts with payment processors such as Stripe, Payza, PPPay etc etc etc There are fucking millions - this works for them!*Get a handheld chip & pin CC machine and swipe your own dumps (I got a legit one of these with this type of account, the possibilities for fraud with this are endless)*Bank Transfers*Payout for online services making you look legit (Elance, Fiverr type places)*Cashing out Paypal transfers, bank transfers and pretty much anything you can use a High Street Bank for*Apply for loans, credit etc*Etc etc etc etc etc   [WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO OPEN THE ACCOUNT] *UK Drop*UK ID (Name, address, DOB)*Burner Mobile*Socsk5/RDP (not essential but best to use one)  The Intro listing of 5 at Â£49 is here: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/9910  I am sure a couple of UK peeps can verify/vouch for this guide & I will be happy to send a copy to well known UK TCF/EVO Members such as SniperFox, ZuluAlpha or anyone of similar standing   Thanks for reading JJ",""

Think white noise, pink noise.  If your neighbor has a mic trying to record you and your voices are what you are worried about then understand some simple audio acoustic principles and they won't hear shit.  The speaking voice is between 500hz and 1200hz for a male.  If you generate low volume noise that sweep this frequency spectrum, your speech, when recorded under these circumstances, will be without clarity and individual response, thus muttled. PM me if you need specifics.  I do take tips.  I am an audio engineer.

I usually access .onions with TOR browser bundle on my Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit PC just fine, BUT I just bought a laptop, which I want to use TOR on. Firstly it came with shity Windows 8.1 software: I tried downloading the TOR BRowser bundle and installing. I could access google.com and anyother normal website, but every single .onion website wouldn't load. it kept saying: "" Unable to connecttFirefox can't establish a connection to the server at xxxxxxx.onion"" For every onion site. They are not down, as I am simultaneously on those sites on my PC. I tried installing VirtualBox and running an ubuntu OS in there, but that went to shit as the guide was too old. So I formatted the laptop, and installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit again on the laptop. After a bunch of driver problems because my laptops a crappy lenovo ideapad flex 15D, I managed to get most of the laptop working fine under Windows 7 (except Ethernet and my SD Card reader, oh well). I tried installing TOR again, and surprise surprise I am getting the same error on every single .onion I have tried googling this for 6 hours, and have tried the usual set my laptops clock to the correct tiem to the second/set it forward an hour, turn off my firewall completely to see if that was the problem etc...

Besides i did a few tests with the 'time thing', and that brings up the 'time out' error, not the 'Firefox can't establish a connection' error.... I am completely lost. The only thing that is now different about the laptop and the PC is that the laptop was 'designed' for windows 8 not 7 (hence why some of my drivers won't work, because there are ONLY windows 8+ drivers, therefore there is a slight incompatability with some of my hardware. But I doubt its a 'driver conflict' as TOR was doing exactly the same thing when Windows 8.1 OS was installed from manufacturer, on the laptop.

You need the right lenders that'll let you close it with no physical appearance and already have the dealership paid when you show up. 2. You need the right fullz, or you'll have to make a down-payment. 3. Most won't let you just walk up, hand a ID get it scanned signed a paper and leave with a BMW 320i. 4. I teach you how to cash-out the cars.","MrMouse wrote:For those of you on this forum board who have bought a vehicle.Maybe 8% of you...  if you just apply the same basic rules as buying a car in your own name, the same rule of thumb will apply here.The only difference is you will be acting as someone else, hints stolen identity."

We all know those kids who huffed gasoline to get high. People just can't be protected from themselves. At best, EDUCATION and HELP is the way to go, not IMPRISONMENT - which I'm sure you agree with. The fact that the US has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world says it all really. Something bad wrong. Yep. A slight tangent to that is all across the country local LE bust drug addicts and call them 'dealers' because they got a bit for a friend. But in the eyes of the law, same penalty. Good advice really. I can't argue with that. Some of those of us who have become physically dependent on any drug may never be the same again.

"Evolution Forums","anonooomoto","4984","2014-03-20T15:02:21","Re: Home Depot checking ID at self checkout","Security & Anonymity","Well thats what I'm wondering. Either: A) It's a new store policy to check ID on every CC transaction at self-checkout or B) It's store policy to check ID on items over ~$200. I'm leaning towards B. When I scanned my items over $200 at the self-checkout, it would automatically call for the attendant. The attendant would come over, take the item to her station, scan one of the bar codes on the item (as if to ""clear"" it for purchase), and then she'd bring it back and ask for my ID and CC. The first time she asked for my ID and CC before I purchased the item. The second time the attendant asked for it afterwards. Seems like items around that amount require approval to be purchased at self-checkout.

Since 1.2.2 is fairly new, I thought I'd reach out for help from the community. Maybe others are having trouble as well, or have found a fix for this. Here is the situation: Tails ISO burned onto DVD. When restarting, booting tails from the DVD is no problem.Second, I go to tails installer, clone to my USB stick, let it do it's thing, and it tells me it has successfully cloned the USB stick (4GB). So I figure I'm ready to proceed to the next step. Here's where things get weird:When booting tails from USB, it immediately boots windows. This happens when manually selected when the computer is booting, and it also happens when I place USB boot at the top of the priority list in my BioS config. When BioS boot order is placed in order of USB > Optical Drive > HDD, I am left with a blank screen.When booting from the DVD, tails tries to load, but fails at the point where the text changes to fitscreen and doesn't fully load. Here's what I really don't get:If I take the DVD I used to make the clone, it will no longer work. I have to make a new DVD of the same ISO I used before, and it will work again, and the same incident happens when trying to make another clone and boot it.  The terminal says everything is ready when I run the cloner, I notice it say something about making it bootable before doing a final check, but I simply cannot boot from USB once it's cloned. The whole ""having to burn another tails iso"" to install the clone to USB doesn't make any sense to me either. I feel like I have a solid understanding on this installation, but it clearly isn't working.. Is there any ""derp"" moments I'm forgetting in this process? It seems everyone is having no problem loading from the clones, but I'm totally out of ideas, and short a bunch of (lol) DVDs.  If there's anyone out there with a suggestion or recommendation, I thank you in advance for your help. It's driving me nuts.  What could be causing such odd, unusual behavior with so many people successfully doing exactly what I seem to be doing?  Infinite",""

"Evolution Forums","InfiniteCom","40788","2015-01-05T04:16:41","Re: Fresh tails 1.2.2 clone unable to boot.","Security & Anonymity","Fixed the issue myself, thanks. If you would like the solution: Use 2 USB drives, and follow the instructions in the 5 step process. When it comes to rebooting your clone, DISABLE ALL FORMS OF BOOTING aside from usb, and make sure that your usb drives are actually bootable. Check through fdisk to make sure this is flagged. (I bought a new stick, and this was not done when I asked to make it a bootable drive). This will FORCE your machine to do nothing else but load the USB, as long as you have it flagged to do so.  I don't know how I fixed it, but by double checking all flags in linux and disabling all other boot sources, I was able to load my clone and create a persistence partition. It now boots in persistence mode with no issues, and once the clone was ejected from the machine after successfully checking to see if data stuck, I turned my other bios boot options on, and everything works fine.  Not sure where the kink was, maybe the stick was bad from the start. I just used 2 brand new ones. Close thread",""

My advice: First try to get your first VPS anonymouly. Lowendbox may have some vendors available who allow to pay with BTC. While getting your first one, nothing should have your IP. I would say try a month perfect privacy for that first one.Set up a secure server! I would recommend a KVM one as you can encrypt the disk at least and also decrypt it on boot from remote with some tricks. (Hint: https://www.howtoforge.com/unlock-a-luks-encrypted-root-partition-via-ssh-on-ubuntu but a little different) Drop everything beside one random port for openvpn. From your first node start buying some more VPS from other parts of the world. OpenVZ and XEN PV stuff is cheaper but you don't have as much control as with KVM or normal XEN. Do the same thing basically on the other VPS, too. Also install TOR and set up ssh as a hidden service additionaly, just in case you lock yourself out of the VPS. The endnode should be in a country which doesn't cooperate with your or the node before. Don't trust EU or US based ones imho. Check where the provider is located. If the company is a US company but sells VPS in sweden, it won't help you. Back to the point: Tunnel yourself from one node to the other. Have a way to check which node is down in between if connections don't work. Have strict firewall policies! (Shutdown on unwanted or normally impossible connections to the outside)The most important point is the starting point. Your own home connection is NOT an option. IT IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE.There are multiple vulnerabilites in wifi ap these days and I'm not talking about WEP. Get some good wifi hardware and find some neighbours which vulnerable APs. Use this connection but randomize your MAC and stuff. Old people or computer naive people are better as they won't check the router interface or do an ARP scan on their net. Another option is 3G. But I kind of would't recommend that. Too fishy with the latest relevations.Besides that: If you see that your neighbour gets raided you have some time to clean up  The rest is up to your internet usage. No facebook, emails or other stuff that is connected to your person or was at any time. Secure handling of money is also a different topic just like a secure base system. Don't forget plausible deniability.And if you don't become greedy you will be also safe in the future.

"Evolution Forums","gaom8Che","40178","2014-12-30T01:25:34","Re: Linux Security","Security & Anonymity","It's good that you are getting into Linux. I personally feel there is zero chance to really secure a Windows or Mac computer much less an ipad or smartphone. Since you want to learn I think it better to explain some things at a high level which will give you a framework for accomplishing your goal. A computer is just a lump of metal and wires (hardware) that need programs (software) to make them work. It's pretty neat that a computer can remember what you were doing. It does this by writing to the harddrive so that it can remember after the power has been cut. Initially when you turn on your computer it loads all the programs on the harddrive into RAM. RAM needs electricity to remember stuff. RAM also makes it much faster to changer things inside a program when it's running so that the computer doesn't constantly have to write to the hard drive. Like when you have firefox open and it updates. After the update it makes you restart the browser. That's because the one that you are using lives in RAM needs to be replaced by the new one that replaced the physical one on the harddrive. Another example is when you open a text file. You can change anything you want in the text file while it's open. That's because it is living in RAM. If you try to close it, it will say 'save before closing'. That's because when you close it you are taking it out of RAM and storing it on the harddrive. If you want the computer to remember your changes it has to save it to the harddrive before taking it out of RAM. So there's a potential point of weakness. What is your computer saving to the harddrive about what you are doing when you turn it off? Who you are chatting with and what you are typing for example. Another word for that is logging. There are logs that can tell you what goes wrong with your computer if a program crashes. How often do you look at logs? Does it really need to happen? If something does go wrong can you turn it on for a while? What may seem like a benign example. What documents have you recently opened? That may be useful to you but that may also be useful to someone who is interested in what you are doing with your computer. So you like the internet. Another point of weakness is who you are talking to and where is that communication originating from. Combined with logging and that could be bad. What programs do you need to connect to the internet and where do they log? Who are you connecting to? Your ISP? They know everything about you. Are you connecting to a VPN? Are you connecting from a coffee house? Are you connecting from your hacked neighbors wifi? When you connect you also have a 'fingerprint', just like the ones on your hands and possibly just as unique as you. Check out ****CLEARNET**** https://panopticlick.eff.org/ Maybe you log into your known gmail with your browser then you do everything possible to hide your IP and everything else you can think of but then you log into EVO with that same browser. Oopps. Google TAILS. It helps with alot of stuff but isn't a silver bullet. In fact nothing is. It's a cat and mouse game. Don't end up just eating cheese getting fat and not caring that the cheese is sitting on a trap. The cat is watching. For everyone else, I know this is simplified and borderline wrong. But I meant to help OP understand so he can help himself.",""

"Evolution Forums","Minima","40178","2014-12-30T14:36:55","Re: Linux Security","Security & Anonymity","Good OS (or OS-like) things to use: - Whonix (on a secured Linux host, SELinx or Apparmor, default-deny firewall, root account disabled, VPN on the host machine, there's really a ton of stuff, but once you're inside Whonix you're good. - Tails, everyone knows that one.  It works well usually. - Qubes OS (only if you're using a fairly powerful machine, but probably even superior to Tails and Whonix) - The yet-to-be-released subgraphOS looks very promising Those will all do most of the legwork for you.  Stay off IRC and ICQ.  If you need to chat, XMPP with OTR on a secure machine, but try to avoid it. MAC spoofing is recommended if you can do it properly (as in know what would be a viable one to spoof yours as, sometimes it's painfully obvious and thus more suspicious if's done poorly) Tor, of course.  Anything DNM related Tor Browser exclusively, NoScript fully disabled, several other options tweaked.  If using e-mail and you like Thunderbird (can't stand it myself) use Enigmail. PGP everything always.  4096-bit keys MINIMUM if using RSA. If using DSA/El-Gamal, you can keep it lower but it won't kill you waiting an extra 4 seconds decrypt/verify/sign shit.  Any key I use for serious shit is closer to 8k bits.  Make sure you know how to use it properly including signing, encrypting/decrypting, verifying signatures, issuing revocation certs, etc.  Change keys every few months. But really if you're asking questions like this in this forum, just use one of the OS things at the top.  The weakest point of any system is always human and if you don't know what you're doing and you're trying to setup a ""secure"" OS yourself, don't use it for this shit until you know what you're doing for sure.  That could take years.  I cheated because I am a consulting penetration tester by trade so I came pre-installed with the know-how.  If I'm bored and high enough one day I'll write yet another comprehensive guide for the forums here.   Oh also check out anonguide.cyberguerrilla.org (or it's .onion equivalent) for a super simple guide to setting up Debian host + Whonix securely.  You literally cannot fuck up if you do as it says.  Pictures for every step.  If you fail at that...you have unusual hardware (a lot of mine needs drivers not in vanilla Debian, so I can sympathize) or you should probably drag Tor Browser into your Recycle Bin, empty it, and then DBAN your HDD.  Unless you have an SSD.  In which case, just the Recycle will prolly do fine.  Maybe overwrite with pseudorandom garbage if you enjoy that sort of thing. Sloppy OPSEC catches up to you, always.  Do not think you're safe because you've received 70 packs to your home without using PGP.  You very well could get legally raped for that down the line.  Not super likely, but why take the chance?  But it's your life, and your decision. Evo is probably the most competently run DNM (I'll be so sad if it turns out the admin(s) registered for the hosting with their personal address), and it appears that the team actually has experience with not-getting-arrested instead of just programming and idealism, so you're right in being here.  But don't let that make you complacent.  I used to enjoy SR2 (mostly the forums) before it went down and I was surprised at how basic Defcon's fuckups were.  Especially with how he ran his mouth so much about learning from DPR1's mistakes, it's almost funny to think that his were even worse (except the fact that he's probably going to spend life in prison...nothing funny about that, but I know several 12 year olds who could have ran that operation more effectively.  I'm not kidding.)  It was over before it started.  He should have just did more shutting the fuck up.  Not that I'm one to talk.  But hey I'm high as shit.   Okay bye time to do something that isn't type here.",""

But if you're serious about making your first hundreds and thousands a week, and want to have a right method to cashout your cvvs and paypals, this is the guide to go. âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââWho is this guide for?

Right next, he goes to the flesh of the guide. I must say that mrwaterhand's guide will not only teach how to cash out your paypals, but most important, he will also teach you 2 different methods of how you can put money on them on a clean way. I even suggested mrwaterhands to rename his guide as this just not focus on cashing out paypal. but teaches how to put fund on thems. I've personally used those methods many times before as I knew them before and it's not probable they will saturate soon. So in simple words, you're not only buying a method to cashout paypal, but to fund them too with CVVs. Author also gives some sites examples to work on that I really recommend, that based on those, you search for alternatives to expand on the methods. of course, the ones give, work great at the time. Is just nice to find your own alternatives. âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââHow much can you make? As in many carding adventures, this depends solely on the time dedicated and the good cvvs you have access to. but it should be some grands at the week if you play this game seriously and with good energy. âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââFinal Words I asked mrwaterhands to reconsider the original price, as there are other methods and information right now that is giving much value for the price asked and he was right to put it at $45. So now for this price, is more affordable for new comers and newbies wanting to enter the paypal world for the first time.

Does each instance add another run through the Tor network or something? I'm firm believer in your safer using what you understand well for security other than just piling a shit ton of concepts ontop of each other. Not saying you dont know what your doing. For instance you can have a huge chain of remote desktops but if you dont understand it and leave the printer option ticked (as set by default) it'll map all the way back to you.",""
"Evolution Forums","rat1989","7730","2014-04-22T05:19:30","Re: Too much security?","Security & Anonymity","This is how you isolate the vm from the host : ""First download the 32-bit (aka i386) installer image file for the Linux distro that youâve chosen. Then open VirtualBox, and click the New icon. Enter your desired VM name, and select the proper OS type (Linux) and version (Ubuntu for Ubuntu, Mint or Xubuntu) or Debian. Specify 1 GB memory to avoid disk swapping. If host RAM is limited, you can reduce it later. Use the defaults for virtual hard disk type (dynamically allocated VDI) and location, but specify at least 100-200 GB maximum size. The initial size of the virtual disk will be at most 5-6 GB. But with large maximum size, itâs very easy to accommodate unplanned growth. After reviewing the final summary screen, hit Create. Next, tweak the new VMâs settings. In the General/Advanced tab, leave Shared Clipboard and DragânâDrop set to Disabled (for security). Under System/Motherboard, change the boot order to Hard Disk, CD/DVD, and deselect Enable absolute pointing device. Under System/Processor, select Enable PAE/NX (if your host supports it). Under Display/Video, increase video memory to 128 MB (unless host RAM is limited). Under USB settings, deselect Enable USB Controller (for security). Now add the OS installer image. Under Storage, highlight the CD icon (named Empty) under IDE Controller. Then hit the CD icon to the far right of CD/DVD Drive, and select Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file. Navigate to wherever you put your installer image, and select it. Then click OK to exit the settings screen.""If the vm is isolated and you use vpn on host and vpn on vm, if it happens an accident you will reveal the ip from the host's vpn...You will still be safe (if vpn was bought anonymously)...",""

You are supplied the ip so you can geolocate it if you dont already know the area and find one that matches closely. Edit: Youre going to have to play with different banks to see which are more lax. Some will not have a problem with a proxy that is close to the actual victim, some will make you answer a series of questions in order to continue, some will require sms verification if the user has set it up, and even some wont give a shit regardless =P its all hit and miss while you are experimenting.
