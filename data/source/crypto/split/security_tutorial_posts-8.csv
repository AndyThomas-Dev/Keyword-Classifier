I am quite confident it is secure, as anyone would tell you. They don't need to break TOR to identify people on the Darknets, from what I've seen. A few fake vendor accounts, a few informants, maybe honeypots ... they've got all the info they need. Speaking of ways to id TOR users, I've seen SEVERAL 'honeypots' while searching the Darknet. Instead of delivering up the proper site, they'll throw an error and say ""Oops! An error happened! But YOU can fix it. Report code 129182 to blabala@bafaa.com"" ..

"Evolution Forums","InfiniteCom","40906","2015-01-03T18:48:47","Re: Best way of getting a drop","Security & Anonymity","I have a few tips on some do and don'ts when it comes to drops. 1) If you're going to use a PO, use a fake ID. Have someone else go in with your key, and say you're there to pick up a letter or parcel under the fake name's PO box. Be careful when selecting a PO box to open, as some places don't seem to give a fuck about what comes in, and won't raise any alarms if they suspect something suspicious. Also, don't say a WORD if you're stopped leaving the area, if you're the one getting it from the PO. You might need a lawyer now. Again, don't say ANYTHING. It CAN and WILL be used against you. Keeping your mouth shut is 101. This is of course if something were to happen. PO boxes can be shady, I tend to avoid them. I'll ship to them, but I don't like using them as a drop. Do not send to abandoned or foreclosed houses. If the house being watched, you're screwed. Even stealing mail is a federal offense, and again, your best bet is to say ""I was simply stealing mail."", rather than ""I'm just here to pick up my illegals."". At this point, they've red-handed caught you doing something illegal, go with the lesser offense, and then keep your mouth shut and get a lawyer. Or just keep your mouth shut the entire time. No one ever got out of a bad situation by cooperating with the feds on this one. Paying for a drop:This is risky but has it's advantages. Offer someone you trust with a clean record, no drugs in their system, a solid job, some money to receive the package for you, with a slightly altered name, but nothing that would stand out blatently as a wrong name, or fake name of someone who doesn't live there. The mailmen know their routes, and I've talked to my mailman on several occasions. It's not a bad practice to be friendly with the ones handling your packages. Once they get the package, sit on it for a bit. After some time goes by, you should be fine to have a third party pick it up, and bring it to you. You owe it to your drops to pay them well, and to warn them what to do should something happen with the parcel. Don't tell them what is inside. Make sure your drops and your pickup people don't know eachother. Have them leave it somewhere for the third party to intercept it. Make sure this is done after you're in the clear. This setup requires a lot of resources, but it does work, and under any circumstance, don't open the package until time has passed.  There is no 100% foolproof method of drops, this is my personal opinion however. This is the game we play.  I've also heard of drops to people's offices, where there's a LOT of mail traffic, and if you're sneaky enough and you arn't expecting a giant box, you can arrange to have it come in with the rest of your normal mail. Since people use offices and businesses as return addresses, you can claim to be the victim. Again, act clueless, and say nothing, because as far as you know, you have no fucking clue why you're being questioned about a package you weren't expecting, when you constantly get mail similar to your package. I don't vouch for the security of this, as I have not run into it often, but it seemed like a good idea the way the address was setup. I could tell these customers had thought about using these places for a reason. I would highly advise NOT stealing someone's mail, especially when it contains illegals, and if that's the only thing you're taking from their mail... You're kinda fucked. I've intercepted parcels at places I've stayed, right after the truck is down the road, but NEVER from a neighbor. You never know who is waiting for their own mail, and they might straight-up catch you themselves. I hope I have not misinformed anyone here. If I have, feel free to correct me, or suggest additional ideas. Remember, know your rights, and know your lawyers number by heart. They won't be letting you use your phone to get it. Drops need to be carefully setup, don't fuck around and send stuff to random addresses and expect to go thieving mail boxes. Infinite.",""

"Evolution Forums","InfiniteCom","40906","2015-01-06T16:38:40","Re: Best way of getting a drop","Security & Anonymity","If they suspect you're getting illegal mail and build a case enough to the point where they have a warrant to open your mail, you're kinda fucked. Just because it isn't a PO at a post office doesn't mean you're any safer. The usps isn't the one getting the warrant either, it's LE that does that. LE doesn't care where your packages go, they care about who gets them and where they are going from the PO box (like following you home). The advantage of a PO box is that you can send someone else in or have someone else send someone else in to get it, distancing yourself from the physical destination. If you start getting a bunch of weird overseas packages, you can be reported for suspicious parcels no matter where your PO box is. Decoys are not a bad idea if you're going to do that. Send legit stuff in really shitty/shady packages to your PO, and then it ""blends"" (always wanna blend) with what normally comes in for you. I used to see people offering decoy packages as listings, they would send odd weights and intentionally make it look like a drug pack. After a few of these, a real drug pack would be less suspicious.  Again, the USPS isn't the one opening your mail. LE is. Sometimes the USPS will tip off your local LE if they're asshole enough and suspect your parcels of containing illegal contents. I'm not saying this WILL happen, but it can. Most people are not going to give a shit about your mail. Some people are assholes though, and some of them probably see the package and think ""I wonder why he keeps getting these weird packages from China and India..""",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","41432","2015-01-05T23:48:48","NetFlix blocking VPNs","Security & Anonymity","i got this in email today:  Netflix is reported to be cracking down on people using virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent geolocation restrictions. If true, this will make it much harder for Netflix subscribers to watch movies and television shows only available in a region other than their own. According to TorrentFreak, Netflix has begun taking action against VPN users exploiting this workaround. Several VPN providers, including TorGuard, are reporting an increase in access problems. While the crackdown is currently mild in nature, there are fears this is a test run for a larger crackdown in the future. Netflix has informed Engadget that there has been âno changeâ in the way it handles VPNs. A spokesperson then clarified the situation by telling The Next Web, âNetflix simply uses industry standard methods to prevent illegal VPN use.â Using a VPN to access content meant for another territory does go against Netflixâs terms of service, meaning this could be a significant change of strategy.  ----    imagine it's a TOS violation. i don't know hat to make of this as i don't know how Netflix can tell you are behind a VPN. the only possible way is that they have a list of VPN addresses, much like the blacklists of TOR exit nodes. But that would have to be an awful big list, and i don't imagine that it could possibly be complete. this has implications far beyond Netflix. it may require configuration changes on the VPN side. MLPS is a popular protocol that usually dumps the user at the hop immediately before the target IP. maybe this will get dropped as many people use VPNs for legitimate uses. after all the weren't invented for illegal purposes.   but on a side note using VPNs and browser fingerprinting (another topic i have been devoting a lot of attention to). today i was able to login to my bank from Singapore, without secondary security questions. since there are no cookies, the must be using a browser fingerprint to identify me. this is good because it gives me a means of checking my routine to defeat fingerprinting.

MLPS is merely one way to implement a VPN - of course it is no unicorn to make the destination think last hop was the originating IP. if that were the case the traffic would never make it back (it would only go the last hop) what i was trying to say was that the target site can probably identify the protocol as MLPS - thereby exposing a VPN implementation. i don't know about gamers, but i do know that Hulu is one of the big players behind browser fingerprinting and Evercookies. i don't see how VPN can be identified except in some cases. i think it is more a scare tactic than anything else, but it has implications far more reaching than just netflix.   they said: âNetflix simply uses industry standard methods to prevent illegal VPN use.â    i don't what are the industry standard methods are  (but sure would like to) - and what constitutes illegal use? violating TOS agreement is not necessarily illegal. there could be a TOS restriction on obscene material but that is not necessarily illegal.

Think of a Proxy as a Web Filter. The proxy settings are applied to your internet browser whether you're using MSIE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Etc. When browsing the internet through a proxy server, all benefits with that server are used, for example, (Security, Speed, and Geographic Location). The proxy will only secure traffic via the internet browser using the proxy server settings. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service provider(Virtual Private Network) encrypts all of your traffic, replacing your ISP and routing ALL traffic through the VPN server, including all programs and applications. This also will use all benefits of the VPN server such as (Speed, Geopgraphic Location, and Security).The VPN can be easily connected or disconnected with the click of a button. In conclusion, a proxy server is completely browser based, and is not as compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology such as: Comedy Central,Zatoo, Fox OD, and Sky Player. However, a VPN will work with ALL internet based services, but will offer less choice on which applications will get run through your ISP, as with the VPN, everything is routed through that server when connected.

The goal is to move silently, swiftly and avoid LE and keep out of the greenlight. So why don't we share our info, I'm hoping to use this thread to make one big collab of anti LE info. I'll even do diligence on some of the info posted here and add it to this main hub thread.  Well, we all know an abundance of non-public info has become available since the creation of the deepweb. Some things people may just know, others they find. So lets share, lets better this community and make this one hell of a journey for LE to find us!  Just some insight on why I decided to put this together: Lets take a perspective at why most street drug dealers get busted, oh wait that's easy. They run there mouths, put themselves in harms way and act like fucktards. Now if you take something like a cartel where they have systems, failsafes and most of them are hidden and no one knows who their leaders are. It's extremly hard to track and cut down an organization like this. They know their enemy, infiltrate it and study it.  This is Evo's collection of that info:  At the very Minimum these are REQUIRED:   A.) Tor Browser: Duh You're on it so I won't link it.   B.) Socks5 Proxies: vip72.asia   | Or you can use my referral - http://vip72.com/?page=register&type=191812  - These can be used by simply downloading proxifier and these guys socks5 client, Use by the port located on the upper right hand corner of the socks client, into proxy servers tab in proxfier.  C.) VPN: I suggest www.mullvlad.com - It installs itself. I've never had a problem, it's fast and it protects incase or socks5 failing.  *Proxifier is good, but if you use my link for socks5 it will come packed in.  As suggested by Dark_Mark: #1. Use a bootable usb or CD preferably with an OS on it. This is because they are ultra portable, and most modern computers have the capability of booting from one. #2. MOST IMPORTANTLY, USE FDE ""Full Disk Encryption"", also when setting this up dont use a common simple password, you need to come up with a long and complex password using upper, lower case letters, numbers and special characters. #3. Use a different password to login then to setup the FDE on boot. #4. Make a folder on the computer which is further encryption top of the others, store vital info in here. #5. Use random passwords for all your log-in passwords EVERYWHERE. Example ""GJsa16saf6asf-asjtrkyusga?ga2sf54ag"" This should what a typical password should look like. I then make basic text files within the encrypted folder ""see above"" to store this info. This way if someone does compromise a password they dont have access to your whole world. Also worse case scenario, if you have to dump the drive, there is no way for LE to force you to incriminate your self further, this is because most people should not be able to remember random passwords and different ones to each login. #6: Learn to use linux. Linux was designed by hackers for hackers... well kinda, but since all of the software is genneraly open source, the community has the ability to improve on it. There are MANY different distros out there, find one that offers very good security as mentioned above and learn to use it. I am not a fan of tail, or other similar types of distros because they are sometimes very hard to use and understand if you are new to linux, what i really mean is unless you find your self a huge amount of time to master the quarks of that particular distro to use its feature set then I would not. Me personally I like ubuntu knock offs, all of the main stream ubuntu packages generally work as well as the commands so you can find support for what your wanting to do. #7: The shows that portray LE being able to crack encrypted drive in 30 secs is a farce by far... Here is a little tool you can use as a reference to password brute force crack time.http://calc.opensecurityresearch.com/ and this https://www.grc.com/haystack.htmMy keys which follow what I have said above, even on the fastest brute force attack system processing 985k keys per second would TAKE FOR.....EV......ER.... but it all comes down to the complexity and length of the password. Remember you only need to memorize 2 of them. If you happened to get pinched DO NOT GIVE THEM THE KEY no matter what they offer... and or if they ask you to put it in for them go ahead..... just dont use the same key, use a random one... and when it fails say that they must of fucked it up by trying to break it, because in most cases when they try to do a forensic recovery they will break the FDE if they try to tamper with the file structure. #8: No matter what is on your drive. IT IS NOT WORTH JAIL TIME. if the heat is coming down on you.... get rid of the drive or destroy it. NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT then your freedom. #9: If you are doing something nefarious..... DONT FUCKIN DO IT AT HOME SON... #10: TOR is your friend, but you must keep it updated #11: Get an anonymous vpn service, one that accepts bitcoins and does not ask questions or keeps logs. There are many of these out there. #12: When using a VPN service act like tor does and make random connections. What I mean by this is use different vpn locations randomly. The service I use for most of my fun time has over 60+ servers all over the world. If you are accessing the same site, make it look like you are not at the same damn spot day in day out JUST IN CASE tor is compromised.... Q1.) Is LE allowed to sell info, drugs or whatever else illegal. A.) Short answer - They are allowed to sell stolen info if they get a court order or subpoena.  Q2.) Do They Make Profit From This? A.) Yes, they seize the money as evidence.  Q3.) Do LE take over accounts if they track a Illegal dealer? A.) Yes, one way or another. They either make the owner work for them or they have one of their agents work it.Additional info: Do some googles on shadowcrew; koomba jhonny  Q4.) Can LE track Bitcoins? A.) Yes, If you post your bitcoin address on a clearnet website, link it with something connected to you in anyway they can get your IP if they really want to and bust you through your bitcoin address.  Q5.) I'm using X, Y, and Z to protect myself, Am I safe? A.) Really depends what X,Y, and Z are. If you're using an Linux operation system that you uploaded to an offshore enrypted dedicated server paid for by carding, and host a keylogged, ratted or botnetted Encrypted computer from that operating system and using all the proper stuff (tor, socks5, non-log vpn(That is not from the same company as socks5)) from that you may be safe. As always tech is advancing and you can be traced more easily now, so this may not even be safe.  Q6.) Cop says he can get me out of jail in XXX Years if I help him, should I? A.) NO, Only the District attorney has bargaining power. Cops are the little peons in the task force anyway. If you do get busted say nothing, talk to your lawyer (hopefully you've been stashing your money you can buy yourself a damn good one). It's very simple, if a cop catches you he is little time and assuming you've got the right channels you can either make bail and use a fake id to hide, or your just go free assuming he has little evidence and you didn't run your fucking mouth. Things get a little different if it's the FBI or Secret Service. Both of these have to have subpoenas to act or arrest you. Which requires enough evidence PRESENTED to a judge, that he believes will be enough to get a conviction.  Q7.) What is the best type of encryption to use?  A.) Your local police will not even be able to crack AES so if it's them your worrying about you're not thinking here. The FBI on the other hand has all the tools needed to crack every single piece of your hard-drive you have encrypted. It's a sad truth. So don't keep all your shit on one hard-drive. Seriously though, it's still a good idea to encrypt with truecrypt with AES-TWO FISH-SERPENT with 35x overpass.     I NEED YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS! POST THEM BELOW. PLEASE DO NOT REPLY QUOTING THIS WHOLE MAIN THREAD IT CAUSES CLUTTER. PLEASE NO FLAME WARS.   This link is your friend: http://fkyvwpu7ccsorke2.onion/  This little guy is called the noreason link page. It has everything your little heart can desire. Including cyber security and numerous tuts.  To hold your hand, here is the LE page to get a little idea of some stuff : http://fkyvwpu7ccsorke2.onion/sets/-Law%20and%20Law%20Enforcement/ Here is a page on digital tracking and such : http://fkyvwpu7ccsorke2.onion/sets/-Surveillance%20Intelligence/  Post anything you may know.

Use native and full disc encryption. Use strong and random passwords. The human mind handles 7 characters very well and up to 12 readily, that's any 12 characters. Get used to using 'muscles memory' pass-phrases. I have had my discs taken, and have been given a court order to surrender my pass-phrase because the police, and then the feds could not crack it, even with their brute force bots. Key length is directly proportionate to the time needed to crack it. Remember, they may be technically be able to crack my system, but the trick is I'll be dead and gone long before they get it. Tor is your friend, yes, but there is MUCH more to be done. There is no such thing as too much encryption, encrypt your text, send it over encrypted channels, through anonymous proxies and VPN's. The more layers you can put between you and LE the better. Make sure to use out of context words and phrases and refer to things in analogy, computers, especially regex has a hard time dealing with shifts in these patterns. Make sure to break up your patterns of when you're online, when you respond, and from where you're connecting. Try not to use the same place twice. Dark has a great point here as well, break up your data! Have fun with it. split it, shift it, then encrypt it. zip it across multiple discs and keep those discs far away from each other.",""

Use linux (Ubuntu), install Virtualbox and install Windows inside that.  Do all your carding from inside the virtual Windows machine.  When you are done with it, delete the virtual machine and create another fresh one.  This way, you can have several different virtual Windows machines on the go, with each 'victim' having his own virtual machine. This may be useful as you get to keep the same cookies in the browser when you re-visit, so the online shop will possibly trust you more.  You can use the wifi at your local independent coffee shop, or even better, get a 3G dongle and use it from the comfort of your home.","cl3verm4n wrote: throwing my laptop away each week"

For some reason, I cant register my vendor account in the However fourms. However, that it beside the point right now. My real question for some of you vendors who don't mind sharing is:  how is everyone going about purchasing postage? For my first few items I sold under my new vendor account I had to go ship and pay for postage in person at the post office. I really would like to remain more anonymous in the future. I have seen postage from several vendors I have order from be shipped with a printed trackable label. The only way I could do this, is to pay USPS to print a label online. But if I were to give them my credit card number to pay, that would immediately loose my anonymity. I tried using to pay online visa gift card, but USPS online shipping simply won't accept that payment method. It acts as is it knows i'm trying to pay with a gift card and declines it even though I have the funds.  Perhaps it is declining the visa gift card payment because it detects I am trying to make a payment through tor?  So to my only real question: How can I purchase online postage via USPS without giving out my credit card number or information.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

What I got out of this so far is that you can send packages anonymous using Standard post. I looked on the usps website, it still says you can not send anything over 13oz first class, it has to be either priority or standard post. Obviously, priority is ruled out. So sending standard post, they say you have to go into the PO to buy postage. Do they also need a license like they do when shipping priority? Or is just weight it, get stamps and send it?

I can't have ANYTHING to do with anything that would even get me suspected in some shady shit or I lose my bread. On the other hand, I am the only one in my community who knows how to make quality eddibles and help people with their medical needs... so it's a dilemma. The local asking price is almost 10x what DC is asking on here so seeing as I am making no proffit on the product i'm buying, it's natural to be looking for the cheapest base. Would it be wize to just buy 5 different 1$ guides on here just to get veryfied by the vendor or would that raise suspicion?

People I know who played the game knew they were playing with fire, but thankfully everything went amazingly well.  In this situation, I wouldn't worry about it if your vendor has a solid rep. And read the feedback and look for pro/cons (if any, some vendors truly kick ass), and see what other people are saying about things like stealth, speed, that sorta thing. Always research and try to communicate with your vendors if you can, if you're extra worried about a particular issue. A lot of vendors are accommodating, and these are the keepers. Talk to the guy, be straight with him and see what comes of it. I find that communicating with my suppliers beforehand is the best thing I've ever done before placing orders I regret.","usermyname wrote:PS!

E.g. you earn 3k in a month but you have 200k on your bank account you must have a veeeerrry goooood story that they do not take away your money. But this depends on the country also. In Germany they cannot take away your money that fast, but in other countries like Italy (Mafia, Cosa Nostra etc.) they regularly check on normal people and if they see that the taxes they pay do not fit the money they have in their bank account or the size of their house, the LE in Italy will just take away the house and the bank account. The same is for people earning not much money and driving a Ferrari. If the LE or the tax people see that they will be suspicious and you should have a good explanation how you got so much money for that Ferrari. So in my opinion the answer is YES, the LE can very well take your Bank account if they get you doing Fraud and / or they see that you cannot have earned this much money legally.",""

I could confirm what you said in US are basically same in Canada, same $10k limit here, but not aware of the structuring shit. The tax situation is a little better but not so much. Tax authorities here are likely to wait for u to forget reporting $50 tax, and a bigger amount of tax mis-filed. so that it makes you a ""consistent"" tax skipper and they can give you a big bill. I know many Chinese guys are making big deposit from China to Canada and of course above the bar, not just rich dudes buying houses but even students will deposit 50k for a single shot, and they simply don't give a fuck.

I have noticed several mechanisms active that LE use to identify users of TOR. This doesn't prove they are guilty of anything, it just identifies them. But once identified, then LE can do surveillance. LE practices I've seen or suspected: 1. LE vendor accounts to gather info. Maybe they sell fake or legal goods.2. Bad tech advice for newbs.3. Honeypots, especially forums.4. Exit node clearnet 'errors' that try to trick you into identifying yourself. (seriously, bizarre)5. Probable traffic analysis. e.g. If you are using TOR, but also have legit traffic coming from your PC routing out to services that identify you. Ooops! Now you're tagged as a TOR user. Doesn't show what you're doing on TOR, but ...6. Selective service outages to identify where the route to a server is.7. Etc... Also BEWARE updates to existing Tor Bundle software, or any other updates. These could easily be compromised. An update pushed out. Everyone applies it. Bam, they all get identified. Just my thoughts. I prefer to not be arrested because I am fascinated by this tech, so try to play it safe. Those who do this professionally should be doubly safe and have a tech member of your team, if you don't already. Just be careful, as LE knows techies are in need, and thus may insert their mole as the technician you need. Also, from what I've seen, LE has a *very* sophisticated and capable tech team.

Granted, since it's so easy to monitor a remote device directly, secure encryption of messages during transit may or may not do you any good in the end; still, certainly can't hurt.  If all you're worried about is keeping somebody who has your phone in their hand from reading your messages, any old app will probably do. Take note: it's pretty trivial to get the usage data for a prepaid phone (Tracfone at least): all you have to do is take a picture of the battery compartment, say you're the owner, fax it to them with your request, and they'll mail you two years worth of records.",""

Having a buyer giving a poor mailing address than returned to a business or the local and the package is reported that entire role is garbage to top it off that entire area is now a red flag for you due to the label giving authorities a much smaller area to search this is why priority mail is becoming less popular for vendors.","wo84seirr43 wrote:Agreed a lot of vendors are not using priority mail  but he probably isnt a vendor and if he is going to send one package priority its not gonna hurt.

Buying bitcoin straight up in your name is not anonymous at all, it's like opening a bank account basically. I use mixers, I have used Bitcoin Fog, Bitcoin Blender, and Helix Light. I do not feel in any way, shape, or form, safe with any of them. Because you cannot truly have any idea who and what you are really sending your money too, unless you actually work for the mixing site and know first hand the process they use.  Why do I use them when I do not feel safe with any of them? Mainly because I think the reward is greater than the risk. I do not have enough knowledge of how the whole process works to intelligently mix the coins myself. Yes, apparently with enough know how, you can mix your coins yourself through sites like localbitcoins and a few others, and then move them around from place to place so much that it becomes nearly impossible to possibly follow your trail. That is the only sure way that I know of to protect yourself completely (or close to it). However, I am a follower and not a leader in this, so I do what is popular and take the blind leap using mixers like fog, blender, and helix, and so far, I have not gotten into any trouble with LE. (Keeping in mind I order an average of 1 item per month in small amounts from DNMs, therefore even if caught red-handed, it would probably not amount to much.) This is what I know for certain, Bitcoin Fog, which I have used a couple of times and never had any trouble with, has scammed people I know personally. You can do a search for it in these rooms and find info. about it, you can search reddit and find info., and you can even look on their personal forums and find info., on them selectively scamming. However, I do not think it is done intentionally, I believe that Bitcoin Fog is compromised from time to time and money has been taken, that is my theory, and even though I never had problems, I would not rest easy using them. Now Bitcoin Blender (another site I used a couple times with no problems) was recently taken down for a little while, it was hacked and that is widely known (warnings were issued on all DM sites, this is a FACT and not my opinion, they announced it themselves. However, they apparently have paid most of the victims back, although I am not 100% sure of this, and for many, I believe their reputation will be forever tainted. Helix and Helix Light (I have recently been using Helix Light exclusively with no problems) seem to be the least shady of all mixers. Helix released a statement of a hack attempt about a week ago against Helix Light, but it was apparently unsuccessful and no one lost money. Helix claims to wash your coins in a way that you are receiving completely clean coins, that have never touched DNMs before. However, how on earth you could know that for sure is beyond me, but they seem to be the new ""go to"" mixer. For their services they take 2.5% of your coins off the top, at least that is the fee for Helix Light. With all that said, I am honestly ignorant of how most things truly work in this area, so I just wanted to give you my knowledge and personal experiences with the popular mixers, and I hope it helps you. I wish I had the capacity within me to truly understand how the ""personal, do it yourself mixing processes"" you need to undertake to make yourself truly anonymous, or at least close to it, works. Unfortunately, I simply lack the intelligence and aptitude to do so, my knowledge of computer technology in general will never take me there.

This completely breaks the chain of ownership, twice. You might want to run it through a mixer once before you exchange the BTC for LTC, but honestly you likely dont need it. If you're high - very high level vendor and/or admin and/or want to be bulletproof.  This also works Evolution => 1st wallet => Deposit into country that hates your county => Run through a mixer => into shapeshift (conversion to litecoin) => litecoin wallet => shapeshift (conversion to bitcoin) => 2nd walletAs long as the last wallet/cashout isnt in your name this is pretty much bullet proof if ur an admin and you live in the US. *if ur in Russia, obviously you dont need to do most/any of this. a few services will mix and break the BTC chain of ownership without converting to another cryptocurrency which is a lot more cost effective. I suggest you look into that.

"Evolution Forums","Ifyouknew","32929","2014-12-05T09:17:08","Re: Are Mixers Important?","Security & Anonymity","Okay, so I'm assuming the answer to my question is, Yes, you do have to provide your personal info. I've had two people PM me saying that personal info is putting it lightly on some of these machines. One guy said they wanted to know every address he lived at for the last 10 years and every bank account he has had in his name during that period. He also said that the atm had a camera on it that watched him the whole time. I would never in my life buy my coins that way, but to each their own.  I'm in no way an expert on the blockchain and the way LE watches transactions, but if your buying coins that have all your personal info on them, and then sending it to a wallet you created that you claim has none of your personal info on it, now it does. Your buying your coins completely publicly. Anyone could straight up eyeball that transaction from point A to point B. So once you send your personal coins to your non personal wallet, things have become extremely personal. Your basically opening up a public account. Anyone can freely view this transaction. What you do next is what matters if your interested in any kind of anonymity at all, it is not advisable to send coins with your name all over them to a DNM.  So at this point, whether or not mixers are important, is entirely up to you. I know Evo has internal mixers, but it's insane to think that's real protection. You must have so added safety. That's just my opinion, like I said it's up to you. My advice is to either send your coins from your wallet to a mixer of your choosing, or learning a ""do it yourself technique"" of washing your coins. That's all I have to offer, hope it helps a little and I hope you stay safe.","ihaveanumi wrote:Ifyouknew wrote:JustLookin67 wrote:Id like to know this as well.When you by your bitcoins through these systems, do you have to give all your personal info.?

Blockchain sharedcoin uses what is known as coinjoin. It takes your transaction and places it in a large, shared transaction. This certainly blurs the trail left by your transaction (known as ""taint"") but it does not erase it and there will always be some degree of taint in a coinjoin/sharedcoin transaction. In order to fully remove the taint, it is best to make use of traditional mixing services like bitcoin blender/btcfog/helix. Personally, I use bitcoin blender because they have a low minimum withdrawal amount, allowing you to test the mixer for yourself and verifty that there will be no taint. I don't have links to fog or helix, but I am sure someone here can help you. Bitcoin blender is at http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/. In summary - yes, mixing is extremely important.

"Evolution Forums","Ifyouknew","32929","2014-12-08T07:13:38","Re: Are Mixers Important?","Security & Anonymity","Yes I know a lot of people that only buy their coins with localbitcoin. Apparently, many people seem to in time form good relationships with others on there. These are ""like minded"" individuals, and through that they form their own kind of network. By doing this they then buy and sell with little to no markup between each other many, many times, often changing the bitcoins into several different forms of currencies along the way until they get back to zero. By zero, I mean zero taint. I know that sounds like a lot of work, but I have been told that it quickly becomes second nature, and they feel it's worth the effort to know that your coins are now completely taint free. I would go into greater detail, but I am simply not privy enough to the process to speak intelligently about it. On a personal note, I do not feel I do anything, for lack of a better word, bad or shady enough, to really merit doing something like this, I'm extremely small time and only engage with people that have great reps. For this reason I believe a mixing service like Helix or Helix Light is good enough for me. I loved BitBlender, but after speaking with friends and some vendors, I realized that I just cannot bring myself to feel comfortable using them at present, even though they were by far my favorite.

You're always on the secure side if you encrypt everything by yourself.  And don't use safe-mail, it's far away from beeing safe.","""For those who use safe-mail.netImperial units of measure being increasingly forgotten, the peck should be defined as a measure of dry volume approximately two gallons in size. In other words, one should eat quite a few meals over a period of a year or more with someone before you trust him.It is appropriate that this anonymous proverb forms the opening for this issue of ""Being Sovereign"" because one of our anonymous colleagues has done quite a bit of research on Safe-mail.net, the Israel-based ""encrypted"" e-mail provider. We wanted to share some of this information for your benefit. By the way, we've eaten a peck of salt with our anonymous colleague, and have other reasons to trust him.Safe-mail.net is one of several e-mail services that offer to provide secure, encrypted, web-based e-mail service to the general public. The idea seems to be that people who would not be willing to take the fairly short amount of time to learn to use PGP encryption would be able to secure their e-mail by trusting a third party, in this case the folks at Safe-mail.net.We reject that idea on several grounds. First, the company that provides Internet services for hosting the Safe-mail.net system is Barak.net.il, based on our review of the domain registration for Safe-mail.net. Barak.net.il is one of three companies with a license from the Israeli government for providing similar Internet services, according to the English-language version of their web site, as we understand it. Perhaps it is merely a coincidence that Ehud Barak was once head of the Israeli Defense Forces intelligence branch.Second, the Safe-mail.net system is ""an IP trap."" Our anonymous friend indicates that your IP address is linked to your e-mail account. The user agreement indicates that it is a violation of the user agreement to employ an anonymous proxy or otherwise attempt to mask your true IP address. So, while no identifying information (name, address, phone) is requested when you set up an account, your IP address may be traced to your physical location, or at least to your specific Internet Service Provider, even if dynamic IP addresses are used. Thus, your location and possibly your identity would be exposed. Also, IP addresses are not stripped from e-mails you send from your Safe-mail account, so your recipients see this information. (And, of course, you may be tempted to identify yourself to your correspondents within your purportedly encrypted e-mails.)Third, Safe-mail.net makes the usual disclosure that they may disclose your account activity, stored e-mails, and other information upon court order or law enforcement request. They make the unusual variation of this disclosure by stating that they may disclose these things whenever it is in their interest to do so. This vague contract clause should scare anyone who thinks about it even briefly. Given that Barak.net.il is licensed by the Israeli government, it would seem quite likely that the Israeli government could command that the data from all Safe-mail.net accounts be provided to the government, and it would clearly be in the best interests of Barak.net.il and conceivably, by extension, Safe-mail.net to make such disclosure. Then it would seem to become a question of whether you have reason to trust the Israeli government.We found no details about the encryption algorithms used to provide for security with Safe-mail.net. An investigation of Israeli law suggests that there is a mandate that encryption have back doors or key escrow for use by Israeli authorities. So, again, it would appear to be a matter of whether you have reason to trust the Israeli government. We don't have anything against the Israeli government that we don't also hold against nearly all other governments worldwide.It is widely known that Israeli security and intelligence services have cooperative relationships with the related services of other countries. For example, if a USA government agency wanted information on someone who happens to use a Safe-mail.net account, it seems logical to suppose that a request (formal or informal) might be made to the Israeli government.While it is impossible to know whether or not Safe-mail.net accounts are ""Mossad-transparent"" or a kind of intelligence sting operation run by the Mossad, or others within the Israeli government, what is publicly stated about the system seems to be closely aligned with what one would expect to find in that case. We have no information presently at hand that would tend to disprove the hypothesis that Safe-mail.net is an intelligence sting operation.There is always free meat in a bear trap. Be careful."""

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","23596","2014-12-31T03:03:05","Re: Email providers you trust?","Security & Anonymity","No email provider can be trusted. They offer a service, usually to make money or to build a reputation. Anyone will do anything for money and pretty much anything for a reputation. If you are worried then always communicate with PGP, if the recipient does not accept PGP then do not communicate with them. Unfortunately that excludes a fuckload of the real world including your bank, your work, your friends, your family and anyone who will instantly give your game away even if they don't mean too. If you want an email provider mainly for business, make sure it's completely separate to any personal email addresses. Always use a decent VPN provider and even Tor to add some more layers of protection. Don't like anything to your personal life, use fake names, use an email address that doesn't correspond to you. If your name is Joe Bloggs then don't use joebloggs_heyLE_itsme@email.com.  As long as you use VPN+Tor and you don't throw yourself into the pit by giving away anything that could incriminate you, even if LE did demand the email provider to give them access or whatever, they'll only have an IP address that isn't yours, a bunch of jumbled up bullshit in the form of good 'ole PGP encrypted messages, a fake name and that's it. The only way they could then track you is find out where the IP address is and who it relates too, if that's a VPN provider then they may ask them to turn over logs. The VPN provider and logs topic..... this is a long winded discussion so it's best to keep it short and sweet. Your email provider AND your VPN provider won't think twice about ratting you out. There is huge debate about whether certain VPN providers keep logs, some say they do, some say they don't. Either way, you can never know. Buy your VPN with bitcoin, use fake information, use a burner email address, register that address on public wireless perhaps.  They can't trace you then onwards. But all that aside.. it doesn't matter about encryption, about any of that. All it comes down to is the one federal department you don't want knocking on your door. And if they have enough reason, they'll try and take down any email provider, any VPN provider they can to get to you. It's tried and tested, it's been done. Also, don't rely solely on PGP encryption. They can now legally ask you to decrypt all messages or give you a longer sentence. So in theory, everything swings on a dime. Like the domino effect. If one domino falls then the rest will too. But on a basic level. Always use PGP. Buy your VPN with BTC and use fake details. Always use VPN when connected to the clear net. Separate your personal life away from business. Think that's obvious? Many people have been caught by simply using their business email for public/personal use and been fucked over by the feds. Don't get too relaxed. Best serious advice I can give you.

Silk Road Vendor âCaligirlâ Sentenced to 5.10 Years in Prison Posted by: DeepDotWeb December 19, 2014 in Featured, News Updates Leave a comment Former Silk road vendor Matthew Jones, a/k/a âCaligirl,â âDynamite2k,â âDynamite`,â âTyler Zeddai,â âMateo Jonesâ (profile backup) who was arrested around May, Was sentenced to five years and ten months in federal prison for selling Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, MDMA, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, and Hashish and operating a drugs lab, according to a press release from Justice.gov, full details about the arrest and conviction:     Texas Business Executive Sentenced To Prison For Illegally Selling Oxycodone On Silk Road FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 18, 2014     Orlando, FL â Senior U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp has sentenced Matthew Jones, a/k/a âCaligirl,â âDynamite2k,â âDynamite,â âTyler Zeddai,â and âMateo Jonesâ (44, Dallas, Texas) to five years and ten months in federal prison for illegally distributing controlled substances. He pleaded guilty on August 26, 2014.     According to court documents, while Jones was working as the Chief Technology Officer for a software consulting company in Dallas, he operated as the vendor âCaligirlâ on the Silk Road drug marketplace. Silk Road operated as an online criminal marketplace designed to enable its users to buy and sell drugs and other illegal goods and services anonymously, outside the reach of law enforcement.     Between April 10, 2013, and September 9, 2013, Caligirlâs Silk Road account completed 685 finalized sales of controlled substances. Beginning on July 11, 2013, through March 20, 2014, Drug Enforcement Administration agents purchased and seized more than 400 Oxycodone tablets and more than 900 Hydrocodone tablets from Jones. Jones shipped the drugs from Texas to Central Florida. His sales placed him in the top 5% of all Silk Road vendors.     Authorities arrested Jones while he was travelling back to the United States from Colombia. At the time of his arrest, he was in possession of approximately 8,500 Oxycodone pills. Simultaneous with his arrest, agents executed a federal search warrant at his Texas residence, where they recovered approximately $75,000 in cash and seized a variety of controlled substances, including Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, MDMA, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, and Hashish. A drug lab was also located in the residence.     In addition to operating on Silk Road, Jones conducted his illicit drug trafficking business utilizing an encrypted and anonymized peer-to-peer program.     This case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administrationâs Orlando District Office, with assistance from the United States Postal Inspection Service in Dallas, Texas. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney David Haas.",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","37943","2014-12-14T22:48:27","more LE tactics","Security & Anonymity","i get these weird emails talking about exploits, etc. the thing is they are usually from a white hat or even LE perspective. i don't know how interested anybody is, but even if one person gets something out of it i guess it's worth it. this one is is interesting to me because it involves some of my personal favorite stuff, USB sticks, air-gapped networks, etc. as well as a couple of other interesting tidbits (like auto-run, etc). i have no idea who ESET is or what they do. anyway here goes:     Researchers from security firm ESET have analyzed a malicious tool used by a notorious cyber espionage group to steal valuable information from air-gapped networks. Isolating a sensitive computer network from the Internet can be an efficient security measure, but threat actors have found ways to get around it. A group believed to be linked to the Russian government, know as ""Sednit,"" ""APT28"" and ""Sofacy,"" appears to have developed the tools necessary to achieve this task. In a recent report on the attacks launched by APT28 against European governments, militaries and security organizations, FireEye revealed that one of the tools used by the group is a modular family of implants called CHOPSTICK. Researchers identified one variant of CHOPSTICK that defeats closed networks by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives. One such tool used by the threat group was analyzed by ESET. Dubbed Win32/USBStealer, the malware has been used since at least 2005 in campaigns against government organizations in Eastern Europe, researchers said. There are several variants of this threat, but the security firm has focused on analyzing the most sophisticated one. According to ESET, the USBStealer dropper initially infects a computer within the targeted organization that's connected to the Internet (Computer A). The dropper is disguised as a legitimate Russian application called USB Disk Security. The dropper monitors the infected device for removable drives. When a removable drive is detected, the malware is copied onto it, and its Autorun file is modified so that USBStealer is executed when the drive is inserted on a different computer. In this phase, the malware also marks the USB drive as having been used on a machine with an Internet connection. Once the infected drive is connected to an air-gapped computer (Computer B), the malware is transferred onto it. The machine's name is registered on the removable drive, a process which enables the attackers to map the devices they can reach. The attack only works if Autorun is enabled on the targeted computer. The feature was deactivated by Microsoft in 2009 with the release of a Windows update, but experts say the method could still work considering that air-gapped devices are in many cases out of date due to the lack of an Internet connection. When the USB drive is once again connected to Computer A, the malware operator drops a series of data exfiltration commands onto it. These commands will be executed as soon as the drive is connected again to Computer B. The malware is interested in files used by cryptographic applications, and files that appear to be associated with private software. The threat searches for files of interest everywhere on the infected machine, but it avoids folders created by various antiviruses. Once the stolen files are transferred back to Computer A, the attackers need to use a different piece of malware to copy the data to their own servers because USBStealer doesn't have such capabilities, ESET noted. Researchers say it's uncertain how the initial infection occurs, but a likely attack vector is spear phishing. FireEye has identified a spear phishing campaign that uses the USB Disk Security application as a lure.

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","37943","2014-12-27T19:32:24","Re: more LE tactics","Security & Anonymity","well i believe it was the Israelis Mossad who pulled off the stuxnet attack against the Irani centrifuges, although the NSA and CIA didn't mind accepting credit for it, even though they don't play well with Mossad (to be fair Mossad has a single minded agenda and doesn't play well with anyone). but that attack was carried out against a close network by introducing the worm via USB. you may have noticed that the article mentioned one problem with air-gapped networks is that they don't get patched as often because they are standalone. those boxes in Iran were most probably XP or maybe even Win2000. they still had autorun feature so you insert a device it will execute the autorun file much like an old DOS box ran autoexec.bat. All of that got changed in WIN7 and the autorun feature was disabled for security reasons. there is something called an autorun virus - which enables USB (or even CDs) to autorun. I use a lot of Kingston 32 GB drives that come encrypted from the factory. i don't consider them necessarily secure. they may well be as they have strong encryption. i just don't know if there is a back door that can be opened by an adversary as supplied by the company. i don't really have any super sensitive stuff on them, i use them mainly to keep people who may be in the house from poking around and being curious in general. if a local cop asked if he could look at one of my pcs and it had one of those drives in there, it would just report 'please insert drive'. all my boxes appear normal to a casual inspection. the most damning thing on them is Facebook crap from my wife. i can also use it to see if i am infected with that so-called auto run virus, because if it prompts me for the passphrase without my asking, it means that it is present. if i reboot, then it doesn't ask me - which shows me that there was an exploit that was loaded into RAM. like i said i have nothing to hide really but it shows that opening files can introduce small exploits into memory. my personal opinion is that it comes from downloading crap from that mega.nz server. i don't trust that fat son of a bitch as far as i can throw him. God only knows what kind of deal he has offered up to avoid extradition. as far as stuxnet goes it was those damned Russians who disclosed it, after isolating it, Kaspersky. but i don't trust them either. but it was still one of the greatest hacks in history - the code made the centrifuges run faster and faster until they burned out. i would have loved watch the panic as they started burning up one by one. it has recently come to light that the US. govt has been releasing exploits and while that is no surprise, what is surprising is that Symantec and other AV companies have had signatures of some of these things since 2009 and apparently were warned off of exposing them (or offering protection against them) - presumably under the mum provisions of the Patriot Act. it is assumed they are the acts of the govt because of the sophistication and variety of the exploits that they can deliver. and also they appeared to be aimed at infrastructures (one example being the Belgian phone company) of foreign countries rather than individual targets.  we live in a scary world. no wonder Stephen Hawking says AI can wipe us out.   i do data recovery and have had a lot of experience with USB (and SD) architecture and have followed the evolution of USB sticks their inception. they use what are called NAND chips and the cheap drives use mostly recycled ones that may have as much as 80% bad sectors. hey have a little 15 cent micro-controller that maps these sectors out and manages the file structure on the device. my EE associate likes to remove these little controllers and use them to do robotic processes, like turning on his house lights at intervals so it looks like someone is home when he is out of town.   there has been much over blown talk lately about the Chinese guys that managed to hack the BIOS of these things (only certain ones made one company nobody has ever heard of) and add 512 bytes of arbitrary and executable code to the end of the BIOS. it's not a serious threat - not that many people work at that level - NSA might, but i think any injected stuff would be detectable (but only after it ran). anyway i would say the best idea is not put it your USB stick where it doesn't belong - like a university network. i have utilities that can make them read only (SD chips have a built in switch for this). like my old grandpa used to say don't wipe your pecker on the curtain - or more precisely don't put it in where it don't belong in the first place. what's that old joke about checking for bees.  one final note on USB is a old pen test trick where you drop a few drives around the parking lot of the target company, with a folder on there called something like 'pix of my girlfriend'. invariably somebody will pick one or sometimes all of them up and put them in their desktop workstation and click on that folder. once they do that you are behind the firewall and can exploit firewall weaknesses from the inside (which is never hardened) and at that point you basically own the network.   BTW those Kingston drives i talked about are heavy duty stainless steel - and called data travelers. with those cheap san cruzer disks it is very easy to break a solder joint  and you will get a message like 'need to format', or 'no data found'. if that happens sometimes you can squeeze the drive to reconnect the solder long enough for you to make an image of it before tossing it.

Hacked Internet","Security & Anonymity","Hello all, Just started to sail in those waters and after a lot of reading finally putting my setup together. I have acquired a ""burner"" laptop and omnidirectional antenna, but here a few issues arose. For one, I'm unable to hack any AP's with usable (non waiting-3-minutess-for-page-to-load) signal strength and the ones that seem to have a good connection to me are uncrackable ATM, tried a lot off dictionaries etc.  Anyway, based on strength of this antenna (and it's not super cheap one, should be mid-range) it seems usable AP's are very close to me, like same floor, or floor above/under close. I live in super dense downtown with a lot of condos/businesses and was really disappointed with limited options of good AP's. I mean, I can see over 200 AP's but it seems like maybe 5 would work ok (the ones I can't crack atm).  Now, my dilemma is this, if/when I crack those usable AP's they will be super close, so why not just use an anonymous USB dongle? In my research it comes up as being traceable to anywhere from few hundred to 10-20 meters in dense urban setting through cell tower triangulation, and if I'm not wrong, inability to figure out altitude unless the device also has gps. So I would be pretty much at the same playing field as with those AP's. Now my questions are... How right am I in those assumptions? Do USB dongles also have gps since they have sim cards and all? Has anyone used one and had problems? or used and had smooth sailing for quite a while? Do USB dongles have IMEI? I also plan to use Host OS - VPN - TOR - VM with Whonix on it - VPN and then after that either socks or RDP - socks (unsure, still need to research a lot on it). I'd also encrypt whole hard drive etc. I'd use dongle only for a month or 2 until I get some better directional antenna and try that route but unsure how it would work after this disappointing omnidirectional one.  I'm open to any suggestions or comments, and any new insight or information on this. I kinda feel weird by using one, it just feels unsecure, but I can't come up with cons that are greater than hacking next door neighbors wifi.  Thanks.",""

Hacked Internet","Security & Anonymity","I agree hacked APs sound better but it still tells LE that suspect is close (after they realise AP owner isn't the one doing it). I guess I need to invest in good directional antenna and hope for success from APs at least few hundred meters away. There is a lot of buildings around me and those better antennas seem to be quite bulky, and I'm sure not gonna mount one outside or keep it in full view through windows so blinds are a must, and that will interfere with a signal a bit too, plus the wall(s) it needs to go through ...  Other options I considered were just random coffee shops around the city but being on camera in those is also somewhat of liability. Also traveling takes time and time is money etc.  Also the whole setup would need to fail for them to even get down the wire to a real IP, and then actually find me, and then there is that whole encryption thing. But Murphy's Law and all that... To answer your question, I'd buy USB stick anonymously, with cash. But I would need to go inside the store and get on camera, and as far as being rememberable , yeah, I have some distinct characteristics. I was thinking about going into larger one when it's busy as to leave a lesser impression, not sure yet as of hiding my face from camera.  Money is also an issue, it would cost me around $100 a month because of having to re-buy stick again. At this point I'm leaning towards just going for it and buying one and using it for a month or two.   P.S.: I've read that most carriers keep cell tower records for around 30 days and triangulation is only possible on an active signal. So in theory unless you have some really bad luck or keep using same USB stick for many months, it seems like it would be hard to actually pinpoint you.",""

CCleaner is an afterthought and has nothing to do with anything except (imho) compromise your PC. the only thing it does is plow a path through your computer and it does clean out cookies - if you consider that an advantage. my concern is with these Evercookies/ like i said i am not a carder, but maybe some of this helps - or maybe not.

There are many ways that a VPN server can be implemented from a single user IP to, or, as you mentioned, multi-user ip, the VPN server itself can even have a dynamic IP address if it is using a NAT router to follow it when it's DHCP lease expires. you can even have multiple VPNs to handle the same stream at once, depending on how the router for the server physically sits, behind a firewall or two, how traffic is routed, whether or not it is relayed, etc., literally allow for hundreds of possible VPN configurations. we solve the problem by having our own VPN server. i can guarantee that we are not logging our own traffic, so that old chicken or egg argument which somehow never made it into this thread, is not applicable in our case. if you get a VPS how do you know it is not hosted by LE? it just adds more uncertainty and possibility of compromise to your opsec, which BTW depends on what you are doing. most users on here don't understand that. i don't know what you mean by check tunneling but VPN and SSH both use tunneling. but i can't agree with your logic that you end up with a clean VPN on the other end when you can't be sure your starting point is secure. the first thing you learn as a programmer is that you have to initialize your variables. I wouldn't trust a $2 IP in 5 minutes. his free kiss may be a better option. well i mentioned that his VPN might be better suited at the other end of his config, because unless TOR is breached he is still secure because all anybody can see is that he went on TOR. when they brought DPR down at SR they had surveillance on his home router and upstream on his ISP routers as well as the coffee shop next door to his apartment. there are ways to defeat such tactics, but not by using your suggestions.   you sound to me like a typical EVO user, who has much potential but not that much experience. the original OP on the other hand seems like a noob trying to learn.

"Evolution Forums","Opusx","38948","2014-12-20T08:49:26","Possible upcoming attempts to disable the Tor network","Security & Anonymity","The Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized servers in the network called directory authorities. (Directory authorities help Tor clients learn the list of relays that make up the Tor network.) We are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use.We hope that this attack doesn't occur; Tor is used by many good people. If the network is affected, we will immediately inform users via this blog and our Twitter feed @TorProject, along with more information if we become aware of any related risks to Tor users.The Tor network provides a safe haven from surveillance, censorship, and computer network exploitation for millions of people who live in repressive regimes, including human rights activists in countries such as Iran, Syria, and Russia. People use the Tor network every day to conduct their daily business without fear that their online activities and speech (Facebook posts, email, Twitter feeds) will be tracked and used against them later. Millions more also use the Tor network at their local internet cafe to stay safe for ordinary web browsing.Tor is also used by banks, diplomatic officials, members of law enforcement, bloggers, and many others. Attempts to disable the Tor network would interfere with all of these users, not just ones disliked by the attacker.Every person has the right to privacy. This right is a foundation of a democratic society. For example, if Members of the British Parliament or US Congress cannot share ideas and opinions free of government spying, then they cannot remain independent from other branches of government. If journalists are unable to keep their sources confidential, then the ability of the press to check the power of the government is compromised. If human rights workers can't report evidence of possible crimes against humanity, it is impossible for other bodies to examine this evidence and to react. In the service of justice, we believe that the answer is to open up communication lines for everyone, securely and anonymously.The Tor network provides online anonymity and privacy that allow freedom for everyone. Like freedom of speech, online privacy is a right for all. source: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/possible-upcoming-attempts-disable-tor-network I hope not.....

Another thing you may want to take into consideration is the delcaration for each country.  For example, you can declare the goods as a gift and less than 50 USD to pass through most inbound inspection stations.  Some international letters are routed completely differently than packages so the smaller the better.",""

Do you think that it is a good idea to have the ""token"" for the forum registration so the things we say on here can be tied to our evolution accounts?  I think that is kind of dangerious, people say lots of incriminating things and it is easy to build profiles on people based on the things they say on the forums. I always wondered why vendors used their real names on the forums, I know it helps sales and helps in dealing with customer service issues but stating anything personal on here at all is dangerous.  Shit, I bet LE even has software that can analyze the different emails to try to identify different accounts based on syntax, words, and punctuation.  If there is not something like this in their repertoire I would be surprised. I think that one of the reasons everyone says all the forums ""suck"" compared to the old SR forum and how good it was, (ive seen that written so many times in so many places..truthfully so...)  is because typing on these things is dangerous for OPSEC and a lot of people know that.  I see the LE presence on here so much, to me it is so obvious, shit there are about 5-10 people on here that I just KNOW are LE.  Hornysoccermom is one that comes to mind first thing.  Look at their posts and read them and you'll see.  and their picture....and thename.  LOL like i am sure that user is really a horny fucking soccer mom.    yeah right.  LE wants attention. Other times it's someone asking something obviously dumb or dangerous with one post ..... yeah I know I have a low post count but you guys know from this post how I feel about opsec and the forums...lol. here's my second question.  it's unrelated. Would it be possible for LE to ""taint"" bitcoin in a way that it could be recognized at a later date?  For example, buying cocaine off a top vendor.  The vendor sends the btc to another computer's btc address without tumbling them and sends them to EVO.  He buys a bag of weed and sends it to his address and a few months later gets popped after some investigation.  Is this possible at all? Third question:Once I bought bitcoin from a btc person I found on CL.  I gave him my SR wallet address because I did not have a wallet address on me and was away from a computer but I had my SR address written somewhere.  He wrote an email afterwards asking for a ""good"" address. How did he do that and is this common and I just don't know about it or what? Fourth question:After the anthrax scare on 9/11 I read that the USPS started a new program which can track a letter all the way to its origin at a blue box.  I read this on a forum somewhere and think it was a pretty good source.   How could this be accomplished?  I imagine each blue box has a serial number and when they are initially brought to the sorting center this serial number is somehow attached to the letter.  This is scary.  It means that your proximity can always be determined.  This is probably terrrifying for vendors for example.  It just shows that if they want to bust you they will.  They have the manpower to stake out blue boxes and knock someone if they really wanted to.  If someone sold something that killed someone on here and a big enough deal was made about it, you can bet your ass that if that vendor continued vending he or she would be busted. fifth: sorry about all the questions, I have more but I will see if anyone throws out anything useful. I would appreciate it.  Okay, so I know MAC addresses should be spoofed.  I know this is some beginner stuff here, but who am I spoofing from, the different sites I visit?  Does EVO know the mac address of people who have not spoofed their MAC Address?   In other words, if I were to log on here on one account, logout, create a new identity with TOR, and reregister under a different name.....could EVO attach the two accounts? this is important because technically, if EVO was indeed a honeypot or ever became under the control of LE....and a vendor had a vending account and a different one to buy from.....the vendor could be busted by EVO attaching the two accounts together if he used cleartext or a bad/cracked version of PGP to enter his addresses.  I guess the only way around this is, if you are a vendor, do not buy.   I doubt vendors do that.  There was a guy back in the day on SR1 who would send you cash in the mail for BTC.   As far as I am concerned the only people who would want to do that are vendors or people who got the money through illicit means.  Cashing out oin SR is nuts and to this day i am sure that this was a sting operation.  anyone else see anything suspicious here as far as vendors or hear of vendors that did shady stuff?  well, thanks for reeading this everybody, these are the thoughts that bounce around my head all day.  I appreciate any responses.  meow",""

So, you can use it on any computer and it'll be guaranteed to work right (the same can not be said if you try to boot to USB, the necessary drivers may not be there).

RSA claims that 1024-bit keys are likely to become crackable some time between 2006 and 2010 and that 2048-bit keys are sufficient until 2030. An RSA key length of 3072 bits should be used if security is required beyond 2030.[5] NIST key management guidelines further suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 256-bit symmetric keys."

Best option is to use VPN over TOR if your ISP block TOR. Edit. I forgot to add that you should run VPN in host because on some Linux distro, such as Debian, the VM are quirky and VPN won't work.

Cons:The biggest one in the book. Any above average population city will have a huge parcel interdiction unit. So much more scrutiny on mail Teams of LE specifically trained to find people doing what I am doing in the immediate areaLots of piggies. LE is everywhere  Area with small population:Pros:Largest pro is that there is no unit of the police specifically designed to hunt me down, find my packs, etc...Less police around in general Cons:Everything is more personal. People notice everything.Local police will see you and might even recognize you after a while.People will pay attention to you more as less is going on.Less blue USPS boxes to drop off packs at.    All packs no matter where they are coming from and going to are checked somewhat as they go through sorting facilities and customs. A parcel interdiction unit is just an extra set of eyes on all packs going to a certain area. Worse, these people are actually trained. So they are not like your under paid postal worker who is much easier to fool. Any opinion or knowledge on this subject is much appreciated. There is no place where it is 100% ideal to be a vendor. But I am hoping to find the best in a bad situation. Thanks in advance",""

I personally use blender because there is no taint, scheduled withdraw times actually do work as they are advertised and the support is super responsive. Bitcoin Fog is just too slow IMO and some people (not me) have reported missing withdraws but if you have the time to wait, fog or blender (or BOTH for maximum security) will do a fantastic job for you.",""

As i need the transactions I've made in order to actually buy the coins in the first place. Should I buy the coins then never use the account again or should I make a new account? The problem with a new account is that it will only usually allow you to buy a certain amount of BTC so I kind of need my usual account to buy the amount I need.  Secondly after the BTC is in my localbitcoin wallet whats the best way to get it out should I send it through a mixer service or just straight to my wallet on either evo or a new personal wallet once it is in my wallet should I mix it again before sending it on to the person I am paying or would it be safe to just pay them straight from evo or my new personal wallet.

Microsoft is famous for buying up small companies and incorporating their programs into version of OS. apparently Windows 10 is coming out soon, jumping from win 8.1 to win 10. it can't be any worse than windows 8. i have everything down through windows 7. all my kids use MACs which i know nothing about. i know one time the got locked in somekind of deadly embrace where they couldn't get out of the browser. i did some research (about 5 minutes) and found a knowledge base that had the solution, involving holding buttons down for 60 seconds and other such illogical actions. it got box unlocked, but then i found out that if you took it to Apple store they charge $100. i have tons of boxes with different OS on them. just today i built a Linux Mint laptop, and it is sweet. you would never know it's linux. supposedly it can run windows programs as well. OS for DW activity - you have to be kidding. suffice it to say use as many layers of security as you need to protect yourself from yourself (that would be whatever you are doing.   i have no idea about veracrypt let alone on SSD vs spinning platters. iwould say that any data encryption algorithm would work on either one. how secure the veracrypt - i have no idea. i have my own toolbox of encryption technologies that i coded myself. abetter question might be whether use FDE at all. i personally prefer encrypted USB sticks (they ones now that are 1 TB) some people use micro SD chips so they can swallow them. it's too general of a question.",""

After a certain amount  of $ is deposited into your account the IRS consider it income and will tax you upon it.Im trying to avoid these taxes atm. As well as leaves a trace of lots of cash going through my account and being spent at coinbase atm.  I was thinking about getting a couple partners to get coinbase accounts and get their instant buy up and just do drops into their accounts then buy. Then I heard about circle. I heard you can hook up prepaid cards to circle then buy that way. I went to sign up for it myself and it requires quite a bit of info.  Anyone have any information about getting around this? Should I buy a CC then use the info from that, while using a VPN close to their area to make it look like its them, and just never use the actual card?  I also Remember hearing about the polish bank accounts. Not sure if they are still as easy as to get as they were a couple months ago but this may be a route I wish to take. However how would I deposit cash to them? Wiring money from a bank leaves a trace, without using a hijacked account, plus quit sus when sending money to poland.

I've have tried with the guides I've bought to card from sites especially according to the guide to card very easy sites however they all been burnt. Originally I joined the darknet community back in February learning what btc, darknet and marketplaces were all about. The first site I join was SilkRoad2, then Agora and now Evo. I've lost my second job and ended back home after my lease was up and not happy about it at all(lots of debt).  I've tried using proxies however I've had no luck getting them to work and I followed the directions to a Tee. None of the proxies I tried to connect to would connect either it would time out or fail to connect. What am I doing wrong here? Is it possible that my ISP is blocking my ability to connect to a proxy? I found out that ISP is blocking my VPN. The first Vpn was being blocked and had software issues, at first I thought it was the software however after having the same issue with the second VPN and now the third and don't have connectivity issues elsewhere besides home lead me to believe that it was the ISP. Whats worse is that they block OpenVpn (tcp) and (udp) however PPTP and L2TP is open. How can I card without proxies? I already in a tight squeeze especially since I've been pulled over by the LE third times this year and gotten my driver license suspended and confiscated and owe money to the state for tickets and getting my driver license back.",""

Firewalls aren't perfect, and the ones built-into OSs suck, generally speaking. Even VMs aren't perfect, think sourpill and crypters with anti-VM/anti-Sandboxie methods. They often break the exe, but they do have purposes. Simply being on a guest OS inside of the Host's VM software, without, for instance, a VPN, can lead to infection on the host through the tcpip stack. If you disable internet inside the VM and run a VPN outside of it, there's no issue. Google has plenty of malicious links. Not install, simply run and write in whatever you want with http://www.generatorland.com/usergenerator.aspx?id=2756 , then hit the button and reboot. doesn't take an install to put malware on a PC. Doesn't even touch the internet, so it's impossible for it to fetch a gate script, as there isn't one for this. other methods? yes. Easier? No, only equally easy. All it is, is one click after running the program, changing the serial number, and reboot. The most you'd get from another method is having the program auto-generate its own new serial number. Either way, you still need to run something and reboot.

Crypting changes that, and no one recognizes how pitiful the memory hogs are. Besides, good malware will drop the executable code into memory directly, thus evading detection.  I've never used HDD serial changers before, and I don't really need it, I generally agree. I just know people on here keep mentioning it, which is why I thought I'd post it. Just like carding is not an intelligent way to go, but after a while, I just share the techniques, all personal feelings aside. All in all, it might not be necessary, but the program still does the job, should anyone be that paranoid. This program was actually an inadvertent discovery. Just like the free stuff I posted - many of those things, if not most, I don't even use, myself. I only posted it here, because I know people would want it. i.e., I don't use MS Office or Sony, nor do I use pitiful Zeus and the equally pitiful Blackshades and/or Darkcomet.  Skids are never an issue, and I don't need any AV telling me by signatures, what's ""malicious"" and what's ""not."" Even heavy compression code gets flagged, as do debuggers, decompilers, and disassemblers. It's not worth having an antivirus. For actual malicious software, often a bound stub from Plasma RAT, Blackshades, Bozok, Darkcomet, or something bullcrap like that, skids aren't too intelligent on hiding it. The usual PATHETIC trick used by HF breed is the double extension, not to mention public crypters they don't code and don't know how to code, themselves, with their no-ip running directly to their home network, to which any even half-serious malware reverse engineer can find outgoing connections. AVs are for the weak, but so are tools people use when they have no idea how any of them work. Yes there are multiple services online that do that, most notably, virustotal, which, however, is owned by google, and transmits samples to AV companies. Your best bet, should you create a stub, crypt, and want to test detection, is to upload to F*ckav's scanner. Needless to say, while your specialty is hardware, mine is almost solely software. P.S. You've posted twice.

Well I've got 2 main problems which piss me off using Tails:  1 How to keep an installed application as a permanent one? I obviously activated the persistend volume and ticked all the boxes, but the only thing that it saves is the list of the apps I can install, and not the apps. Every login I have to reinstall proxychains or wine or wathever with sudo apt-get install and configure everything everytime from scratch. Annoying innit?   2 I can't connect via cable because my pc is to far from the router, so I have to use WIFI conn. I've got 2 different wireless adaptors:Netgear: when I browse with this it works almost fine, but every 5/10 minutes it disconnects for a minute or so and then it comes back. TPlink: this connects and browses very faster than the other one, but after a few minutes a black screen comes up with a lot of errors on screen which I can't understand and I am so forced to reboot the machine -.-  Could somebody help me? I can pay a small fee or I can share some digital goods with you.  Thanks!

It's in Israel. They have no issue giving extradiction to U.S. and subsequently, its cooperating affiliations across the globe.... riseup is in U.S......while they are definitely engineered towards no-logging services, and sure they have a hidden service available, unless their ISPs/Servers are from/in another country without leaving trace here, it's no use, and can very well be intercepted, with OR withOUT the group's permission.. why not use either onionmail or mail2tor through a local client with GPG?

"Evolution Forums","FriendOfTheDevil","31749","2014-11-11T01:33:40","Longtime member. New vendor. Capable in Computer security? PM me!","Security & Anonymity","This thread about slightly more advanced OPSEC than usual. If this is too much to read through throughoughly then the position(s) i am seeking are not suited for you.   If you help me to an acceptable point with my concerns i will be more than happy to donate a modest about to you if youd like. Maybe more so if my business takes off! Also free answers to my questions are greatly aprreciated. I plan to become a medium sized vendor exclusivly on EVO in the next 2-6 weeks.'Ive been buying and learning for quite sometime. But, buying personal amounts and trafficing Schedule 1's are two different stories. So heres my Into/questions. Hi there, Ive noticed that Evo forums are a lot more helpful and (no insult intended) simpler to understand  than others(im looking at you SR). And nicer to N00bs. Im not a n00b but everyone has questions from time to time. I am originally a full time member on SRF2(been around since Ross' days) but now that its gone i intend to make this(or Agora, but probably Evo) my new home (and trust me im on deepweb almost every day-all day) My IRL life sorta allows me to be. Which is another reason i want to start vending. Im bored, and i got the hook-up! My product(s) speed, stealth and most of al Customer Service with be exactly what DNM's should represent. ( plan to give free samples as well) Anyway, i was wondering, if your OPSEC is up to par and if youre generous enough to help me through some Secuirty messaures that i cant figure out i would REALLY APPRECIATE the assisstence! I believe that i have enough security to buy safely, which ive been doing for a few years mostly on SR. Ive spent a few thousand USD buying on EVO recently. I have now decided(after much thought) to become a vendor (under a different account, different computer etc. ofcourse) and exclusively on Evo. But as a result of making this serious decison i want to get OPSEC improvements from as many skilled and helpful people as possible. And i like to return favors. RIGHT NOW, i have TAILS (newest version on USB(yes i know a CD is slightly better)) and i can access Tor on it (i just search 'torcheck' in the browser and it says im good to go). So TAILS and Tor work fine. So far. Apparently.  But I cant seem to figure out how to import a vendors PGP key, or store it under his vendor/forumname or email address or marketplace URL ( I would obviously put this somewhere on an encrypted folder on my TAILS USB ofcourse or maybe even a differnt back up encrypted USB if you think its necessary). Nor can i figure out how to write a message' then encrypt it to a friend or vendor's saved PGP key in my keychain. And send it to him.Infact, i cant even find where to acces my keychain while operating TAILS. I've sent thousands of encrypted PMs to many people with many different keys with no problems! EXCEPT ON TAILS I CANT FREAKIN FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPORT USERS KEYS AND ENCRYPT PMs... WTF Not to mention encrypt all the public keys (from vendors and friends) and my own personal username/passcodes/website addresses with one 4096bit PGP key, in TAILS if possible, but also if theres a safer recommendation - dont hesitate. Then i would make like a 25 alphanumeric characters long password and save it somewhere very safe.And use only that passpharse to gain access to the folder with sensitive info in it. THIS SEEMS LIKE A SAFE METHOD/PLANNED METHOD to me. Is it?Please dont hesitate to correct me! ILOVE TO BE CORRECTED! Im new to vending but have experience with buying, legit business and Cust. Serv relations as well as PR and standard OPSEC. Just want to see how helpful the Evo community forums really are. hahaha Thanks guys.  *I also entered three different Tor Bridge Relays (dont worry i got them from a reliable source) but how do i check if they are actually masking my Tor usage from my ISP/LE??? *Persist VolOne more thing i cant understand is, how to configure persistent volume. I barely know what it is. It allows you to save certain onion websites in an encrypted folder on TAILS and saves the links but doesnt allow acces without a master passcode...?Am i getting it right? If so, how do i save the Hidden links i want? When i tried to configure my persistant volume it gives me the following error message: ""ERROR Device /dev/sdb was not created using Tails Installer."" Whats that mean and how do i get passed it? I tried going to: Applications > Tails > Tails installer and it gave me the options of: A) Clone & InstallB) Clone & UpgradeC) Upgrade from ISO At this point im lost.If anyone would be kind enough to tell me what mistakes ive made or what ive done good and help me solve my problems.Like i said, My personal buyer account(s) have adequete OPSEC but now that i am becoming a vendor, i want to improve as AMAP. Any/all advice would be appreciated. And if youre humble enough to accpet donations and your advice answers my questions, ill happily donate some coin, or maybe even some of my product ffor free when i start vending. (2-6 weeks away at most) THIS SEEMS LIKE A SAFE METHOD/PLANNED METHOD to me. Is it?Except for the not being able to save Vendor Public keys and encrypt PMs to people. As well as not being positive if my MAC address is sppofed(I used MACdaddyx) I think it is spoofed(is there a way to check)? Pleas dont hesitate to correct me. Im experienced dealing IRL but new to vending. Experience with buying, legal business and Cust. Serv relations and standard OPSEC. Just want to see how helpful the Evo community forums really are. hahaha Thanks guys.  I know this is a very long message with many questions but i am man of my word, i understand youre all busy but if/when my vending business takes off I ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO HEPLED ME OUT!  -*IMPORANT*- If you or anyone you vouch for are interested in talking to me about my business plan, PM me with your PGP key. Ill get back to you. I will never ask to meet you or ask for any doxx info or anything like that. I am looking for a parter to handle certain aspects(mostly Computer security) of my vendor account. Dont bother PMing if you are a new forum account and no other members trust you. Thanks guys.  Did i mention THE JOB PAYS. Cant wait to pay my bond and get my listings up!Look forward to serving this great community. Long live Evolution MP! Remember my account will be under a completely different Flash drive, vendor name, PGP key, email addy and forum representative!!But ill be sure to let you know.! Any answers or PMs will help more thatn you know!!!",""

Moreover, under the section ""a signature is required"" was ticked under the ""could not be delivered because section"". Other boxes that were ticked under 'Your Item' are parcel and ""Royal mail signed for"". This is something I thought was weird, as the small amount of stuff I bought could easily have been fit through the letter-box.  Also, it was not stated on either of the vendors pages that they will send with ""Royal Mail Signed For"", as that would be a deal-breaker for me (for obvious reasons) to sign for a letter that contain drugs.

You can't simply crawl the entire darknet, its illogical and I'd appreciate if you could provide the article for this.

I have never had a trace of taint on my addresses when sending my coins through blender. For the uninitiated, taint is the presence of your sending address in the transaction web of your receiving address and the lower the taint, the more complete the transaction anonymity provided. If you want to test this, send a small transaction through blockchain shared coin and then use the taint analysis feature for your sending and receiving address. Shared coin always leaves some degree of taint because of the method they use to mix your coins. Now, send a small transaction through bitcoin blender (bitblendervrfkzr.onion) and then use blockchain.info's same taint analysis on your sending and receiving addresses. You will see a taint of 0% every time. For small, personal amount purchases I suppose it is acceptable to skip the mixing step.

Aside from that, the benefits outweigh the risk, in keeping it locally, regardless, you are correct.  As for ""securely log[ed/ging] in,"" I presume you mean SSL webpage encryption? That's not bulletproof/flawless, either. Plenty of rogue certs around the web, even used by the government.From the looks of this, it was not a government-run exit node, however the node, in and by itself, was not, per se, malicious. It was a node that was setup to sniff traffic [i.e., dsniff]. However, while not necessarily probable, the 50 failed login attempts could've been brute forcing. The question is: were you still using tor + VPN when you changed the password, whether encrypted or not? However, I've never had this happen to me. If your pgp/gpg secret key is picked up, then 2-factor authentication is useless. even smartphone-based 2-step authentication on the clearweb can, in cases, be virtually useless, if you do not take care to not get infected: http://www.infopackets.com/news/7984/zeus-hackers-exploit-two-factor-authentication

If that were the case, strictly speaking, they would've gone local, not network-level. This was sniffing and an automatic system to check those credentials. Not hard to do in your basic scripting languages. So yes, broadly speaking, a script that acts as a method of exploiting logins, using the node as its knight on the chess board, but not technically malware, as it did not compromise your localhost. Sniffing, for instance, isn't an exploit, just as dns amplification is not one, PER SE; these are deliberate systems made to work that way, just that they are misused, is all. The script that they'd use to check the login details would probably only be on one of their ends. I know you are not saying malware, I am just clarifying.

It sounds like its more important to have a secure connection via not-at-home Wifi and setting up VPN/SOCKS (which i was thinking about doing ) than to have a bulletproof OS until i start running up a high bill and can afford a better computer. My laptop cant run VMs so i guess XP alone will be enough to get the job done.

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","32699","2014-11-26T23:35:03","Re: Most secure OS setup.","Security & Anonymity","well windows certainly has it's share of security flaws, and i guess if you don't understand what is going on at all times on your system, then it is probably sound advice not to use windows. like everything else your level of security depends on what it is you are doing. if you are just browsing the forums in TOR it's probably okay to use TOR on top of windows. TOR will keep you secure. the only time it would be an issue is if someone has a remote control capability of your computer and they are looking over your shoulder so to speak. most common client is VNC but many others exist and can be delivered as a payload for a malicious Trojan. Linux is also susceptible to having a rootkit replace the kernel and give an adversary full control over your box. if you are doing shady activities all kinds of other features are available to insure your security.   the easiest way to tell if you are being compromised (forget AV software - zero day exploits and FUDs have rendered it basically useless) is to use netstat command (look at help to see which switches you want) any malicious program has to be sending packets back to a mothership (else it is harmless) - and you can detect this and clean your OS accordingly.   so far as windows XP goes, most people never install up to date patches anyway. i happen to have 10 laptops that run something called Windows XP Tablet Edition - which only has a SP2 and wasn't being supported by M$ anwyay. i use them all the time. you can run XP in a VM and be okay. in fact it may be the most stable release, but windows 7 is pretty stable. curiously there are supposedly 30% of enterprise implementations still using XP. and yet i have heard of no major breaches. Many Sony was still using XP - i don't know. even more curious is why some company hasn't stepped up to support XP - it would be worth millions.   i can point out some of the biggest rookie mistakes that can lead to big problems. First off, never click on a link in an email (or anywhere else where it is embedded in an article or whatever) always copy and paste it and open it in a new window. just one quick issue - it can allow for session hijacking - whereby the malfeasant can steal your authentication token, among other issues. also never open a download online. most people don't realize that malicious code can easily be embedded or otherwise binded to files like .pdf or .mp3. in fact all Adobe products are lacking in security features. Flash has been deprecated and Acrobat got so bad that Adobe had to release a program for scanning .pdf files for malware. of course that will probably only work on Acrobat generated .pdf files and there are tons of other programs for generating .pdf.  use an airgapped box with a sandbox to open all downloads. never open them online unless you are certain what is happening. the same goes triple for PGP encrypted files. never decrypt them while you are still in TOR. save them to a USB stick and take them via sneakerware to airgapped box and decrypt them.   speaking of USB sticks there has been a lot of news and rumors floating around about the Chinese guys (they are the only ones with enough patience) who reverse engineered the firmware on the controller for the USB stick and found that they could add 512 bytes of arbitrary code that could execute everytime you insert the stick. well it's a big todo about nothing - at least so far. again AV software can't detect this as it is embedded firmware. but it only applies to one small company that makes the controllers and so far the only instance i have heard of in the wild was the Chinese adding code to report a 64 GB stick on a 4 GB stick so they can sell them for $30 instead of $5. NSA documents revealed by Snowden had a whole presentation on something called Cottonmouth. but they actually added hardware to the stick. but if the NSA is after you then you are already screwed.  speaking of NSA - one of the most spectacular hacks in history (imho) was the Stuxnet worm that got introduced in the closed network running the centrifuges that Iran was using to spin out the enriched U235. well it was done by Israel's Mossad, and while NSA got credit - they probably had nothing to do with it. the exploit was allowed to happen because the boxes were XP and as such still had autorun feature enabled that allowed the code execute when the stick was inserted into the box. it then could replicate to other boxes on the same closed system. it was Kapersky who first isolated it after it managed to escape into the wild. it caused their centrifuges to spin out of control until they burned up. starting with windows 7 autorun is disabled. there is a 'virus' called autorun virus that will make USB sticks autorun when inserted. i don't really consider it a virus, but you can Google (if you trust Google) a fix for it if your USB sticks are autorunning when inserted in win 7 or >.   in response to increased pressure i started using blank lines - to create what some would call paragraphs - whatever.

Whonix gateway is a valuable tool and should be utilized in the proper context. by building a box with a VM it is possible to configure multiple configs (or VMs) in the same box and then select the one that best fits the activity at hand.   DNS leaks are another big issue. DNS requests are UDP datagrams that are broad cast in an effort to resolve hostnames to numerical IP addresses. these things are getting sent out all the time in the background - which is why leaks are an issue. the user never sees this activity, but when you watch a yhoo page load at the bottom you may seen a whole list of sites flashing by. this is all part of the ad targeting stuff, or sometimes image files are stored on a different server, or a hundred other reasons, but in every case the box looks to the DNS server to resolve these hostnames into ip addresses. normally the DNS is handled by the ISP which in turn consults other DNS servers. there are actually surprisingly few actual DNS servers that hold complete records of all the different hosts. TOR uses its own version of DNS using gaurds and other special nodes that route traffic to hidden TOR services. these constantly change - every 24 hours. all the TOR traffic is encrypted and goes through a circuit to reach the destination service. this could be a clear web site. in which case the traffic from the TOR exit node to the site will be in plain text (otherwise the site wouldn't know what to do with it) unless it is a HTTPS (SSL) connection, in which case it is encrypted by the secure socket layer (SSL). many clearweb sites maintain blacklists of known TOR exit nodes - and will refuse connections from those nodes. hence the socks 5 proxy. all of what i have been talking about is pretty much reserved to things like carding and other types of fraud. my personal preference is to build my own DNS table and point the TCP/IP protocol stack at it instead of a public one (that can leak).  hacking is a completely different matter with a different goal. it involves a lot of trial and error and brute force techniques as well as counter measures to cover footprints, such as deleting log entries, but that's a whole other topic. actually i am personally more involved in white hat hacking as i see fraud as too much of a risk. the same tools a white or gray hat hacker use can be used by blackhat hackers. the techniques are the same - it's just the goal that's different. enough for now. goodnight moon.",""

I'm pretty sure I first saw the offer in the USA Coke Review thread but now I can't seem to find it, which is weird. His store page says he's offering 20 free samples (shipping also free) through PMs. One other person said they ordered it and have the sample en route but I'm trying to decide if it's worth the risk. A forum search for the vendor turns up nothing except where the one person mentioned their sample. I'm just a bit sketched out about not ordering the sample through a listing in their store. You'd think they'd want to do that so you can leave feedback on the marketplace and not just in the forums, right? I just feel a bit nervous about sending my address to a brand new vendor with 0 feedback and 0 pending orders through PMs. He didn't even mention PGP, just said, ""Please send your address and I'll send you a sample"" when I told him I was interested. When I expressed my concern about ordering from outside of my country (which I NEVER do), he assured me that he ""goes to great extremes to ensure the security"" of packages and once again to ""Please send address."" Am I just being a paranoid idiot that might miss out on a great deal or does this sound sketchy to anyone else? I've heard of people getting scammed for small amounts of BTC when they are asked to FE for samples but can totally free samples such as this also be unsafe? I'm mostly just concerned about the possibility of LE being involved.

"Evolution Forums","BASICALLY","36753","2014-12-10T12:11:15","Re: Installing Tail linux using VM,Please help.","Security & Anonymity","I don't know any tutorials (try to google something).. If you run Tails from USB there are no benefits in running Tails via VM. Remember that if you run Tails in a VM under Windows, if somebody is logging your activity on Windows they will log your activity on Tails as well. It's never really safe to run Tails in a VM over Windows (but it's still more secure than running only Tor on a Windows OS) IMO, you can take advantage from a VM in 2 cases: 1: you don't want to or you can't use Tails (i.e. for carding is not good). So what you'll do is loading any linux distro from your hard drive, install vm on that, and then load another system in the VM, so every time you have done your dirty things, you just delete the virtual machine and all of your dirty data is gone away 2: you want to test a system before installing it on your HD.",""

If you mean buying things on Evo or similar sites you don't need too many things. Running Tor via Tails and encrypt your messages is enough to buy some cola or a few pills. (directly from USB/CD is much better, but if you can't load it in the VM) A VPN could mean better security if you trust them, or less security if you don't. But I'm not so skilled in this. Also Tails doesnt install itself anywhere, it just runs in the memory (RAM) as a live system and it wipes the data every time you switch it off(except the persistent volume, but only if you decide to configure it).  If you are trying to card, I think the best solution is to install a Linux distro on your hard drive (Debian based, like Ubuntu), and then load on that a Virtual Machine with any other system(Windows is probably best in case of OS fingerprinting (most people use Windows, so best to appear that way. Once the Windows is set up the way you want it, set it up to load read-only so that any changes (like cookies, etc) will automatically get destroyed when you close the VM. )... and yes the public WIFI is always the best solution!   Sorry but I can't help you more than this because I don't want to give you wrong suggestions! I suggest you to:ask help on TCF > http://6oa276dur6udwykp.onion/read the carding wiki > same link as above, look for ""Wiki"" at the topread the tails doc > https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html

My friend is planning on ordering anywhere from 3.5g to 5g of MDMA. The vendor my friend is going to order from is ""GoingPostal"", although My friend will be ordering from his separate Australian-Only orders account ""GoingpOZtal"", which has feedback only from the vendors Australian customers. There are two methods of shipping, one being normal Canadian shipping from Canada to Australia (no signature required and no tracking) and the other being Xpress Australia (requires signature, but has tracking). My friend wants to order via the Xpress Australia shipping because of the quick delivery times as well as having the ability to track the shipment so he has a solid knowledge on where his parcel is instead of it coming a random day weeks/months down the line, but My friend is very paranoid of signing for an illegal parcel. There has been reports of parcels from different countries coming 1 month to a month a half later, which My friend does not want. My friend just has a few questions before doing this. Q. How does one go by doing the international method and which shipping method is the best and safest? Q. Do you put your real name and address? If not, what do you do? Q. If I were to use Xpress Australia from canada, how would signing your real name for a package containing illicit substances work? TAKE NOTE: It is Christmas time, which means the amount of postage coming into Australia will be ridiculous, thus meaning the efficiency of customs detecting illegal items decreases (at least My friend thinks so).

I agree it is important to know your rights but why would you say that and then tell people not to use them in the same breath? Either you don't know, don't understand or are intentionally trying to persuade people against their rights. You are completely talking out of your ass. Talking to the police can NEVER help you under ANY circumstance EVER. I'm not saying to be an asshole to the police. Let's say you get pulled over.  LE: ""Do you know why I pulled you over?"" YOU: ""YES MY TAILLIGHT IS OUT AND I MURDERED 10 PEOPLE."" or ""I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING! I KNOW MY RIGHTS YOU FASCIST MOTHERFUCKER!"" - Those are both bad responses. or LE: ""Do you know why I pulled you over?"" YOU: ""No idea officer."" LE: ""Where are you going?"" YOU: ""Home"" LE: ""What are you going home this late at night for, who were you just with? This is a long way out of your way to go home."" YOU: ""I don't mean to be rude but this is starting to sound like an interrogation and I do not have to answer any questions."" If you want to be a little spicy, which I do not suggest: LE: ""Interrogation? I'm not accusing you of anything. Why won't you answer my questions?"" You: ""In fact, you must be accusing me or have some suspicion of me for whatever reason otherwise we would not be talking right now. Have you ever heard of a thing called the constitution? Specifically the 5th amendment? That is the reason I am not going to discuss anything any further."" And that's it. If they keep pushing, push back with the same thing. If they want to search tell them you do not consent, but do not resist and obey the officer's commands. If you want to be even spicier you can refer them to the 4th amendment in this case. They are going to do whatever they are going to do anyway. You can make an arrest and prosecution easy or you can make them do their jobs properly. You cannot talk yourself out of an arrest EVER. It does you no good to talk to them. If they are going to slap the cuffs on you they will do it in spite of whatever you say. I highly suggest the video I posted earlier in this thread. I sincerely hope no one listens to your bullshit. You are clearly an idiot.  ""Sitting there and saying 'No comment officer' just doesn't cut it today"" spoken like a true asshole - or a police officer. EDIT: This is US specific advice.  EDIT 2: Also, if you hear a knock at the door that is not followed by ""POLICE!!! WARRANT!!! OPEN THE DOOR!!!"" they do not have a warrant and you do not have to open the door or talk to them. They will go away eventually and get a warrant or leave you alone. If that's the case clean house.

What you need is a laptop or computer u can access. It's better to use not your own internet connection.But you will hide your adress so you can use your own internet connection. The second thing you need is an annonymous VPN service that will nog log your activty or even keep logs.You can get them here on Evo. Pay them in bitcoins so the payment can not be traced back to you. And of cource an USB stick with tails installed on it! ^^ When you started your laptop you connect to the network.After you are connected you can click on the network connections in the right upper corner. Near the Shutdown logo. Than select VPN Connections > Configure VPN Than click Add. If it's grayed out use this guide:http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/deiban-ubuntu-linux-networkmanager-pptp-cisco-vpn-tab-disabled/ Just insert the info you got from your VPN provider and your done.

I think your setup is good. If you've never heard of it, look up Cell Phone triangulation. If you use a cell phone the phone company can get your location based on how long it takes the signals to reach towers around you. If you connect to wifi spots in a 360 degree radius around you the same thing applies and they could map the points. They may have an idea of where you are but not a precise location. It's my opinion that you should always point your antenna in one direction. Wifi can still be tracked but they need physical equipment to do it. Spend only the time you need online. Hopefully you put away some cash. Move. Lay low for awhile. The heat will never be gone but the trail could go cold for them and they can't bang their head against the wall forever.  Get anything digital that you've used for your ops and destroy them and buy new stuff. Just like you were starting fresh. All you need is your PGP key. There is no manual on how to do this right and if you've been using the same equipment since the beginning you probably made some mistakes and got better over time. Maybe you forgot to spoof the MAC once. That would be enough to pop you. As far as your BTC is concerned I could give you much better advice if you were in the US but the biggest problem is cleaning money and not doing anything stupid with it. Don't buy an expensive sports car with BTC for example. You should incorporate a legitimate business  and funnel your proceeds through it. I don't have time for an extensive write up now, but if you're interested I will later. We don't know all the capabilities of LE but we do know they are cheating, lying fucks. They may do something illegal to get you're name then use parallel construction to get you. They may try to scare you into doing something to expose yourself. I don't know how it works in Ireland but in the states they will lie to you. LE will tell you someone gave you up and it would save yourself trouble to just be honest to get a lighter sentence if you just admit it. NEVER ADMIT ANYTHING. On the other side, don't say 'I never sold drugs'. Lying to them adds charges, at least here in the states. Just say something like. I have no idea what is going on, I'd like to speak to a lawyer. Talking to the police can never help you under any circumstance. Wait for a lawyer. You should feel good though. I think you're doing things right.

I use a directional antenna so its not being broadcasted all around . Yeah wifi mapping is a pain in the ass ! I cant imagine they would take the time to try and map me . Some of the connections i am using are over 1km away from me .  Usa have a lot more resources then are "" an garda "" do ! As for cashing out thats easy for me , cant say how for opsec reasons .  And no i am not dumb enough to use any of the coin that came out of SR without it being heavily mixed before i do   @ mephestus , i have a runcore harddrive also and its encrypted to a tie ! The passwords are only in my head and if tried to bruteforce it will destroy itself after 5 attempts and by destroy i mean it will physically burn out the drive .   @Conaco , i cant simply teach you how to do it . To hack wep use beini's minidwep . Beini is a bootable operating system and can be put onto a usb stick for use . Also not just any wifi card will do it . You need an alfa 1000mw and a large antenna so you can sniff packets and iv's .  You can also crack wps routers by using reaver as "" maltivera "" mentioned its also a feature in beini .  Kali linux contains all the needed tools to crack wifi , its another operating system that can be booted from usb . Its old name was backtrack .  Its more complicated as you have to learn the commands to turn on monitor mode and also how to change your country as in most countrys the power output of the alfa is limited to .... eh cant remember , sorry . But i remember you change it to BO .  Now as for cracking wpa/wpa2 networks , you will have to learn that yourself as thats a tricky one and can take days to crack .   to crack wep networks it should take around 5-15mins with an alfa usb wireless card and a good signal strength . Wps is a network protected by numbers and no letters , so reaver will start at 00000001 and work its way up until it gets the pin . This can take hours and up to a day in total .  Now some wps routers can detect a bruteforce and will limit the amount of passwords entered and sometimes will go into total lockdown . As for wpa/wpa2 i cant go into that i be here all day   Luckily in ireland we are behind in technology and most routers are still protected by wep or wps . So getting networks here is easy . If in the usa id say they have better routers but then again it depends on where in US your living , there could be many old people that could not be arsed to upgrade security on there routers .   Hope that helps       FT",""

They are going to go after they clean house and send their kids to their mothers house for safekeeping and deny anything. people have been fucking with them and they could plausibly say something was sent to get them in trouble and they know nothing of this. The orders were in two different family members names. What do you guys think will come of this and what is the best course of action? I told them to go to the post office if it will look less sketch and their mail is cut off. this house has received only 3 small orders of xanax previously but has been watched in the past for other things by dcs and suspected of selling drugs (which is not true). I also believe the lsd vendor may be compromised who sent the order and thats how they knew there was something coming to that house, just my theory, he hasnt been online in days, is a new vendor and his shipments have been taking weeks to arrive and he has been using shitty opsec at times like no return address. What do you guys think about this situation and what the best course of action is? everyones tripping right now but we are going to ride it out and see what goes down for the time being and majorly clean house.

It had me kinda paranoid that i was profiled or something because i had been ordering from a seized market, though never had a package not come, nor have i been scammed. i know i was being kinda unreasonable to think that way but i just thought it was really sketchy to not get anything for a solid 3 days or so. Im also USA based.Your situation doesnt seem like any sort of profiling though because they gave you notice. If they knew about the drugs and wanted answers then they would attempt to prove you knew it was sent to you (which this sort of notice, whether discreet or not, would make someone who is guilty of using darknets do anything to show reasonable deniability for the package). and you you might say they might try and question you at the PO if in this case they have infact intercepted the package but even then it would be more effective to do a stop and chat at your friend's house without any notice of any sort showing an irregularity concerning your mail because they would catch you off guard and might have a better chance of scaring you into talking..I would still go with what youre talking about doing in this thread concerning cleaning house and maintaining opsec just in case you do get questioned, though i highly doubt that is what this is.

Theyve been harrrassing my friends who occupy the house fairly regurally about stupid shit and seem to think some evil shits going on there. even though they do not sell drugs or manufacture them, just smoke and take sub and xanax.  Im very confused about all this honestly, pissed im gonna lose 200 dollars, and concerned for the safety and freedom of my friends who live there and have kids. they knew what they were getting into tho and begged to receive product there so in the end i guess it is on them too. its not like i begged and twisted their arm into receiving anything, quite the opposite in fact. i just hate to see it go down like that. my question now is this, why would the police not just deliver the order and then raid the house? theyve done it before and they have a task force. Why would you just cut off someones mail and make them come to the post office to talk about it? I mean shit they could just never go down there theoretically if they wanted and not get their mail i guess and wait it out for weeks. I still have yet to see the letter, havent been able to go over to the house yet for a sec but im trying to because they need to get their laptop out of that house and they dont seem to realize that. Theyve had their relatives come and the relatives are going to take their kids to florida for a couple weeks as they are also in the process of an opiate/benzo detox they are finishing up (Suboxone clinic patients that finally got sick of needing the shit).I guess will find out monday what the deal is but im thinking its not going to be good at this point. probably they found something and are going to try and get them to admit to receiving it (real name was on order) is my guess now. I dont see how they could really get in trouble further than getting a warning or some kind of slap on the writst. the envelope never even touched their mailbox much less their hands, has a fake but legit looking return address, and anyone can mail anything to anybody these days. They never even had a chance to take delivery of it so how could they get in trouble for it? Thats like me mailing a bag of weed to my worst enemies house and them getting that letter and then getting arrested when they show up to get their mail turned back on that just doesnt seem like something that would hold up in court or in the eyes of the law. Idk i guess we will find out monday bc they were too scared to go today."

Hope this shit has nothing to do with all the attention on the dark net recently since the take-down of SR 2.0 and those other markets etc and the arrest of them 2 boys in Ireland.  Truth is that they are overhauling the entire postal system here in Eire according to a mate of mine coz they know shit loads of stuff is flying into the country so international packages will be looked at more from now on which is a cunt!!. At the same time i'm getting packages landing regularly and have experienced no problems but will report back here if any change on that.  I wouldn't be worried about getting into trouble though, especially if your name wasn't on the package and you NEVER admit to anything if a visit was made. In this case don't burn your gaff down just make orders to other addresses for a while and tell the vendor you bought from to change the shit out of his fucking stealth quick and let him know the craic with what happened. Maybe the package was spotted for obvious reasons..  Go smoke a joint all will be well :-)

I don't see how using a dead drop, or an alternate address to one's home address is useful if the same person who is ordering the product is making the pick up. You have to keep in mind plausible deniability so  what are you going to to tell LE when they have your drop staked up and you just happen to come and pick up a package there? To me that is enough to prove conspiracy. I have thought a lot about this and it seems like the best way is to send it to a legitimate address, hopefully someone who cannot be easily tied back to you. Like i mentioned before its all about PLAUSIBLE DENIABITY and when dealing with the Postal Service the fact is shipments can be discovered, that is out of your control. You have to think about what happens once LE discovers the contents of your package are illicit then start their protocol to gather evidence and implicate you in illicit activities. From what ive heard it seems often there will be a controlled delivery, or they can stake out a drop and wait for Joe Blow to come and pick up his package he has so cleverly ordered to some abandoned house. However, if the person receiving the delivery can plausibly say I don't know what this is or who may have sent it to me, everyone involved may be in the clear because there is not enough info to prosecute. There really needs to be more info on this very important aspect. If anyone has anything to add or other strategies regarding opsec on deliveries i would be very interested to hear from you. Also, ive never heard of this happening but what if a bug or gps tracking device is put in the package, does anyone know if microwaving the package would destroy them? thanks, remember there are probably no fool proof ways but everyone needs to be smart to stay and remember the gravity of their activities.",""

If you do it this way worst case scenario if things are taking to long or you see weird activity around the drop just burn it and wipe your hands of it. There is no worrying at that point. If its in your name and it gets seized you could get a raid/visit from DHS and i promise you that is not fun. Its best to keep things as disconnected as possible.  Private mailbox no USPS P.O Box. Get a 6 Month and burn it when its done and move to the next. I usually only use a drop for 3 or 4 drops.

Box (like at your house) is. USPS has to verify your address and you need all kinds of id. However i get mail in there for at least 10 different people who apparently had the box before i did. so i would say that it would be safe to order something in one of those names. Now that is mail fraud - but if you get caught that is probably the least of your worries. it's also illegal to open a mail drop at Kinkos or mailbox etc, or whatever main drop, without providing id. that doesn't mean it can't be done - these guys are private and fix you up for an extra twenty. the mailbox that i have is cool because it's out in the country and hard to stake out. also they have a bunch of lockers that hold packages, so when you get a package they put it in a locker and put the key to your locker in your P.O. Box. i guess the final decision depends on what you are getting. a pro option is to form a corp that uses one of these houses that handle traffic for shell corps and then you get a P.O. box and because it is a corp, your name needn't be anywhere in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws. they will also act as your registered agent and forward your mail. you see ads in USA today and other financial rags about where these places are located. they have classified ads like - create a Nevada Corp for $199 or whatever. if you do it right it can't be linked to you at all.",""

Which mixer do you recommend?

Accidentally connected to home network","Security & Anonymity","Say I have a burner laptop I acquired anonymously and paid for in cash. I boot live Tails on it and only connect to the internet or TOR/DNMs via public wifi, with all MAC addresses spoofed. I never connected this laptop, or its real MAC address, to my home network or any network that could be tied to my real identity... Until a few days ago. Made a mistake when I was installing a new OS on this laptop and accidentally connected to my home wireless network without the MAC address spoofed. So my home wireless network router (my ISP is major one in US) has seen my burner laptop connect with its associated MAC address. Does my ISP-provided router record all of the MAC's that connect to it on the LAN historically...in some sort of log?  I know that my ISP can't see past my router's MAC and can't see which machines are connected on my LAN. However, if the jack boots were to break down my door and confiscated/examine my router, would they be able to determine that the burner had connected to my home network at some point in the past?",""

If the router you're using is an ISP-provided one then they can see all the traffic on your internal network. Comcast, as an example, programs their routers for just this purpose. Yes, as long as logging is enabled (usually by default), but in the above case they wouldn't even have to do that.  Depending on what you do with that laptop, what you did once connected at home, how long you were connected, etc, you'd probably be fine simply replacing the wireless card and continuing on as before.","browseguy1116 wrote:Does my ISP-provided router record all of the MAC's that connect to it on the LAN historically...in some sort of log?;browseguy1116 wrote:I know that my ISP can't see past my router's MAC and can't see which machines are connected on my LAN.;browseguy1116 wrote:However, if the jack boots were to break down my door and confiscated/examine my router, would they be able to determine that the burner had connected to my home network at some point in the past?"

Just reboot the router and the logs are gone (no they aren't going to forensically obtain any deleted shit off your router - lets get real, it would be long gone before they ever got to it in a case like fraud). And the only instance of your laptop connecting to your home network - just delete those logs aswell. Unless you are a high value target of some sort that the CIA and NSA are keeping tabs on, you will have nothing to worry about.

You about summed it up perfectly. Even though it might be in an individuals best interest to change their usernames after a bust like that goes down (I can't blame them for wanting to do so), I have no idea who any of the new staffers are. Seeing as though the moderator that was an undercover federal agent has not been exposed as to who it was (not that I've seen anywhere at least), it could just be another ploy by the feds to run/infiltrate SR yet again.

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","36102","2014-12-06T01:52:46","Re: Using Tor browser on smartphone?","Security & Anonymity","The main problem with Android and Tor is the fact that you cannot encrypt all incoming and outgoing communications UNLESS you root your Android device. Which leaves you wide open to a tonne of security flaws, one being the fact that Tor can guarantee that all your data is encrypted. If you root your device, you are primarily taking control of the device. Android as we all know runs from Linux and Linux you have Superuser which is the highest priority account with the most permissions. But instead of going through to your Terminal like you do on Linux you just root your device by usually unlocking your boot-loader first and then flashing a new recovery. The recovery depends on your device. CWM is the most recognized but this isn't set in stone for all Android devices. After that you can push the .zip file over that sets Superuser on your device. And then you should have root access. You can also manually do most of the shit yourself with adb.",""

It can be disabled quite simply by turning Airplane Mode ON but contrary to this, your phone can receive E911<->PSAP transmissions. You can turn on mock locations though in Developer settings. It's probably interesting to note that you can download funny little Android apps that fake your location too freely available (and for a price) on the market.

Just one more question though, do we need a special command to install those applications in Mint (E.g Tor Browser, MacChanger, VPN/Socks clients), cos i understand linux works a bit differently from windows, i basically have all those applications on a USB, just copy and paste on Mint? thanksno linux doesnot work like thatlook on google how linux works linux you need to learn the commands and so on windows is a piece of shit i recommend u don't use windows  if u are doing business on your laptop/pcfor mac-changer  with this tutorial you dont need to do anything only follow this tutoral then every restart you make on your laptop your mac address will change automaticly so every restart you have  a other mac addressclearnet link>>> http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/376and for PIA u can use this tutorial this is normal for ubuntu but it also works for linux mint clearnet link>>>https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#ubuntu_openvpn_installergo to this tutorial>>>>> Ubuntu Linux 12.04: OpenVPN via Network Manager Setupdo what it says and u are safe"

At least one such provider was caught lying about that, so it is wise to assume that they all lie just to get you to sign up. The VPN provider knows your entry point into the encrypted tunnel, so it is worse than useless if they hand over everything to LE when asked: you would think that the IP of your internet access point is hidden when it isn't. I would use home internet access only for research, and even then at least use the Tor browser, instead of assuming that startpage.com or duckduckgo.com really honor their assurances that they don't keep logs.",""

Like a disposable computer that forces everything to run through the tor network. This greatly increases the reasonable doubt factor if one is confronted by LE for an illegal crime committed on the darkweb because at that point, if your OPSEC is good (oh! how often opsec goes to shit when someone hears they could spend some time in jail:p), and you were using tails and storing the USB/CD that it is based on safely, you could freely offer an analysis of your computer (if it even came to a prosecution) which at that point would provide evidence towards you not using the darknet for anything legal or illegal. That is cool.My questions however.Does TAILS leave any evidence of TAILS being used on your computer in the event of an analysis?(considering one never chose to store anything on their computer they didnt have to in order to run TAILS)How safe is it considering the topic of malicious tor exit nodes?(probably a stupid question) Would just popping the USB/CD it's ran on in the microwave to prevent seizure really work or even be necessary?In the case of a network analysis of wifi would TAILS use be detectable like the use of TOR is?Are there any other programs i could run alongside TAILS to improve security and detectability?

The only harddrive space used during ontime is the RAM which needs to be powered to work, which means that after the computer is shut down, all is lost on the RAM, including whatever you did on the computer using tails OS. Tails does not leave any trace that it has ever been used on a machine. One exception is a cold boot attack, but even there tails has certain security measures in place. - Unless you have a persistent volume set up on your usb key; no data will be ever be found on the usb key, so I dont see the need for it to be microwaved. If theres ever a situation where microwaving a usb key is a solution.. - Tails and Tor are 2 different things. Tails is an OS, Tor is a network - Tails is designed for anonymity, not security - When using tails, you use tor to browse. Its the nature of tor to not hide the fact that your using it. So when on tails, in the eyes of anyone whos watching, you are using tor.  - Can they distinguish between a regular user on tor and a user on tor through tails as OS? Technically: Yes they can, but its very difficult. Unless you're on NSA/FBI watchlist I doubt they will ever try to figure it out ^^ Improved security? VPN's and proxies and what have you, search the forum, the topics are endless, the debates even longer. For a buyer, using tails is perfect.",""

A friend of mine had his house raided and they didn't find the weed in his attic lol.  You could put the weed in odor proof baggies , wrap it in a sandwich bag and then push it into a bottle of ketchup and put it in your fridge. Obviously the size of the container depends on how much weed but inside food containers in your fridge or freezer is a good trick. If it's bulk your dealing with , I suggest finding a middle man. You can give him 125g , 250g , 500g or what ever you see fit. This significantly reduces the risk for you. You have only one bill instead of 10 or 20 people oweing you money separately.  With regards to holding cash , shrink it into smallest amount of notes as possible i.e â¬500 euro notes. Drill a hole vertically into the leg of a chest of drawers , chair , table or whatever and push the rolled up notes into the hole. You could keep about 20 notes in between a picture and the picture frame. Use your imagination. Lots and lots of places to hide money. I suggest reading 'Connor Michael - How to hide anything' for inspiration. Anyone know how the â¬500 note earned the nick name 'The Bin Ladden' ?...         ...Because everyone knows what they look like but , no ones ever seen one.

Thought I'd share this with you. Even though these are from 2013 I think alot of information can still be used. These are NOT written by me. This is a guide with which even a total beginner can get high class security for his system and complete anonymity online. But its not only for noobs, it contains a lot of tips most people will find pretty helpfull. It is explained so detailed even the biggest beginners can do it: It is the === The Ultimate Guide for Anonymous and Secure Internet Usage v1.0.1 === guide. Table of Contents:    1. Obtaining Tor Browser    2. Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time    3. Securing Your Hard Drive    4. Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes    5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes    6. Securing your Hard Disk    7. Temporarily Securing Your Disk, Shredding Free Space    8. Installing VirtualBox    9. Installing a Firewall    10. Firewall Configuration    11. Installing Ubuntu    12. Ubuntu Initial Setup    13. Installing Guest Additions    14. Installing IRC (Optional)    15. Installing Torchat (Optional)    16. Creating TOR-Only Internet Environment    17. General Daily Usage By the time you are finished reading and implementing this guide, you will be able to securely and anonymously browse    any website and to do so anonymously. No one not even your ISP or a government agent will be able to see what you are    doing online. If privacy and anonymity is important to you, then you owe it to yourself to follow the instructions    that are presented here.     In order to prepare this guide for you, I have used a computer that is running Windows Vista. This guide will work equally    well for other versions of Windows. If you use a different operating system, you may need to have someone fluent in    that operating system guide you through this process. However, most parts of the process are easily duplicated in other    operating systems.     I have written this guide to be as newbie friendly as possible. Every step is fully detailed and explained. I have tried to keep instructions explicit as possible. This way, so long as you patiently follow each step, you will be just fine. In this guide from time to time you will be instructed to go to certain URLs to download files. You do NOT need TOR to get these files, and using TOR (while possible) will make these downloads very slow. This guide may appear overwhelming. Every single step is explained thoroughly and it is just a matter of following along until you are done. Once you are finished, you will have a very secure setup and it will be well worth the effort. Even    though the guide appears huge, this whole process should take at the most a few hours. You can finish it in phases over the course of several days.     It is highly recommended that you close *ALL* applications running on your computer before starting.     === 1 : Obtaining Tor Browser ===     The first step to becoming secure and anonymous online is to setup and install something called ""TOR"". ""TOR"" is short for Onion Router"". The concepts behind TOR were first implemented by the United States Military, and these principles have been used to create an extremely secure mechanism for being anonymous online. In fact, millions of people world-wide use TOR to browse the internet and communicate anonymously.     TOR works by heavily encrypting your communications so that no observer can see what website you are really going to, and    what information is really being sent. It all appears as a bunch of random characters to any observer. You simply use the    TOR web browser just as you use any other web browser. TOR takes care of the rest.     However, TOR by itself is not enough. Even when using TOR, a user can be compromised in a number of ways. First, some websites can be set up to attempt to reveal someone's true IP address (their true identity) by tricking their web browser or other software to transmitting that information. For this reason, anyone who uses TOR will recommend that no one have javascript or flash turned on while browsing TOR. In this guide however, I will show you a much better solution.     The second issue is that of human error. Even if you have TOR installed, you may accidentally forget which browser to put in    a link. You may also accidentally click on a link from another program, such as a chat program. That program might then load    the link you clicked on into a non-TOR browser. When you are using TOR, you must be careful *constantly* that every link    goes into the right browser, and that you do not accidentally click the wrong link.     So then, let's begin. Obtaining the TOR Browser is easy. Simply go to the following website:     http://www.torproject.org     Once here, you may feel free to read more about what TOR is and how it works, or you may proceed to immediately download TOR.     Here is how to do so:     1. Click on ""Download TOR"", or ""Download"".     2. You will see text that says, ""The Tor Browser Bundle contains everything you ned ... Just extract it and run. Learn more >>     3. Click on this ""Learn more"" link. for the ""Tor Browser Bundle""     4. Assuming you are an English speaker, you would choose the top-most link ""English (en-US)"". Otherwise, pick the language    best suited to you.     5. The file being saved will be named: tor-browser-1.3.18_en-US.exe     It is ok if the number is not exactly 1.3.18, there are new versions of Tor from time to time. At the time that this guide    was written, 1.3.18 was most current. By the time you are reading this, a more current version of TOR may exist.     6. Run this file.     7. You will be prompted to extract this to a directory. By default, it will be set to C:\Users\You\Downloads\ This is perfectly    ok. You can also choose a different directory if you wish.     8. Click ""Extract""     That's it. TOR Browser is NOW installed. Time to test it out!     === 2 : Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time ===     Now you have successfully downloaded and installed the Tor Web Browser Bundle. You are no doubt anxious to begin using it. First,    click on the ""start"" menu icon, the icon in the lower left of your screen with the windows logo. On the top right will be a listing    that says ""You"", ""Documents"", ""Pictures"", ""Music""... ""You"" of course will be replaced by your user name. Click on ""You"", the top    most link. This will open up your main user folder.     Now, locate the folder called ""Downloads"" and double click on it.     Now, inside the ""Downloads"" folder, double click on the folder called ""Tor Browser"".     Lastly, double click on the application: ""Start Tor Browser""     When you do, you will see the Vidalia Control Panel appear, and you will observe as you connect to the TOR network. When this is    complete, your web browser will open up and will automatically connect to the web address: check.torproject.org     This is to confirm that you are in fact using TOR. If you have followed this guide correctly, then you will see the following    green text, or something similar:     ""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.""     Now you can use this web browser the same as any other. You can go to any website you wish, and neither your ISP or anyone else    will be able to see where you are going, or what you are doing. However, there are still issues that need to be resolved, so    don't begin browsing just yet.     *************************************    ******* IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE *******    *************************************    If you fill out a form containing your email address, your name, or any other sensitive information while using the TOR browser,    be aware that sometimes it is possible for an observer to see that information. When using TOR, use it to access websites and    content that you are *not* connected to via your real identity or any username or nick name which links to your real identity. Let    TOR be for anonymous browsing solely. Do your online banking, or any other activities involving your real identity using your    normal web browser.    ************************************     === 3 : Securing Your Hard Drive ===     Being able to browse anonymously is one thing. However, you may choose to download and save sensitive content or material to your    computer which you wish to keep private. This may include reading sensitive documents, viewing pictures, or storing any kind    of sensitive data.     If you save *anything* to your computer's harddrive, then it is possible for someone who has confiscated your computer to determine    what it was you saved. This is often true even if you delete the content. For example, suppose I use the Tor Browser and I navigate    to a website containing a sensitive document that I wish to read. If I saved that document somewhere on my harddrive, then it is    possible for someone else to find it. If I *delete* that document, it may still be possible for someone to undelete it.     Further, even if I never save it to my harddrive but I simply look at it using my word processing software, it may still be saved in    a number of ways including:     1. Often programs keep records of filenames. The filename alone is often enough to incriminate someone.    2. Often programs keep parts of the content viewed saved for various reasons, such as for searching. This can include random excerpts    of text, thumbnails of images, and more. Often this ""partial"" data is more than enough to prove what the original data was. Often    the ""partial"" data is itself incriminating.    3. Sometimes, especially if you are running low on system memory, your operating system may choose to use your hard-disk as a temporary    RAM. This is known as ""SWAP"". Normally, whenever you turn off your computer, whatever was in RAM is deleted. However, the data that    goes to your SWAP may persist and it may be possible for someone to see what content you had open in your programs if that information    is saved in RAM.     Generally speaking, you *must* have a plan to secure any content that is saved to your hard disk. Therefore, this guide would be incomplete    if we did not thoroughly address this. First, there are two kinds of such content:     1. Deliberately saved content.    2. Inadvertently saved content.     Deliberately saved content refers to content that you have chosen to save on your harddisk so that you can access this content later. We will    address how to do this later in the guide.     Inadvertently saved content refers to content that is saved by programs you use, or your operating system. You have no way to even know what    this content might be. Therefore, this is the most dangerous. You may browse and find a dozen sensitive documents, utterly delete them, and    some program may have saved the file names and excerpts of the data. This will render your previous efforts futile.     Content that is inadvertently saved to your harddisk comes in two flavors:     1. Content that is saved to your SWAP space.    2. Content that is saved by applications running on your computer, including your operating system.     The surest way to prevent content from writing to your SWAP space is to disable your SWAP space altogether. This may result in your computer    running a bit slower than normal, and may mean that you cannot use ram intensive games and applications during the time your SWAP is disabled.     Therefore, if you use this method, simply turn back on the SWAP when you want to use those ram intensive applications. Also, you may choose not    to take this step.     Here is how to disable your swap space if you are using Windows 7:     *** ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. SKIP THIS IF YOU ARE NOVICE OR UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS OPERATION ***     *This step is recommended for advanced users only. If you are not comfortable doing this, you may safely skip this step.*     Instructions are less verbose than usual, as these steps are intended for advanced users only. If you do not fully understand these instructions,    skip this step.     1. From Control Panel, go to ""System and Security"".    2. Click on ""System"", and then choose ""Advanced system settings"" in the left-most menu.    3. Under the ""Advanced"" tab, under ""Performance"", click ""Settings"".    4. Under this ""Advanced"" tab, under ""Virtual Memory"", click ""Change""    5. Uncheck ""Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives""    6. Select ""No paging file""    7. Save, reboot, and follow these same first 5 steps to confirm that ""No paging file"" is still selected. This means that you have successfully    disabled your swap. This means that *nothing* from RAM will be inadvertently saved to your harddrive.     To resume using SWAP again, simply click ""Automatically manage paging file size for all drives."" You can switch between these two modes as you desire.     Generally speaking, your computer will run fine without a swap file, provided you have enough RAM.     *** END OF ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS ***     The next issue we need to address is how to prevent applications and/or your operating system from saving content inadvertently that you do not want    saved. For this, we are going to set up a ""Virtual Machine"".     A ""Virtual Machine"" is like a computer inside of your computer. Everything you do inside the Virtual Machine (vm for short) will be fully contained within    itself and no one will be able to see what the vm has been doing. Ideally, you want *ALL* of your sensitive computer usage of any kind, TOR or NON TOR,    to take place within a vm. In this way, you can keep everything private that you wish while still using your computer fully and getting the most out of it.     Don't be afraid of this sounds complicated. This guide will take you through every step slowly and methodically. Before we can set up a vm however, we need    to take another step.     === 4 : Setting up TrueCrypt, Encrypted Hidden Volumes ===     If you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. You want a way to protect that    information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. Therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your    information and safeguards it against prying eyes.     The best such system for this is called ""True Crypt"". ""True Crypt"" is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories    inside of a single file on your harddrive. Further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your    password.     This sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up. We are going to do so, right now:     1. Go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on ""Downloads"")    2. Under ""Latest Stable Version"", under ""Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000"", click ""Download""    3. The file will be called ""True Crypt Setup 7.0a.exe"" or something similar. Run this file.    4. If prompted that a program needs your permission to continue, click ""Continue"".    5. Check ""I accept and agree to be bound by these license terms""    6. Click ""Accept""    7. Ensure that ""Install"" is selected, and click ""Next""    8. click ""Install""    9. You will see a dialog stating ""TrueCrypt has been successfully installed."" Click ""Ok""    10. Click ""No"" when asked if you wish to view the tutorial/user's guide.    11. Click ""Finish""     At this point, TrueCrypt is now installed. Now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.     1. Click the ""Windows Logo""/""Start"" button on the lower left corner of your screen.    2. Click ""All Programs""    3. Click ""TrueCrypt""    4. Click the ""TrueCrypt"" application     And now we can begin:     1. click the button ""Create Volume""    2. Ensuring that ""Create an encrypted file container"" is selected, click ""Next""    3. Select ""Hidden TrueCrypt volume"" and click ""Next"".    4. Ensuring that ""Normal mode"" is selected, click ""Next""    5. Click on ""Select File""     Note which directory you are in on your computer. Look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely    the home directory for your username. An input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. Here, you will type in    the following filename:     random.txt     You may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. This file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside.    Do NOT use a filename for a file that already exists. The idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.     It is also recommended though not required that you ""hide"" this file somewhere less obvious. If it is in your home directory, then someone who has    access to your computer may find it easier. You can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesn't have to be your hard disk. You could    for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. It is up to you.     6. Once you have typed in the file name, click ""Save""    7. Make sure ""Never save history"" is checked.    8. Click ""Next""    9. On the ""Outer Volume"" screen, click ""Next"" again.    10. The default Encryption Algorithm and Hash Algorithm are fine. Click ""Next""    11. Choose a file size.     In order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. If not, then it is worth it for you to purchase    some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. TrueCrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not    just your hard disk. If you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with    (such as 100 MB).     Ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. I recommend 20 GB at least. Remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create    additional TrueCrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.     12. Now you are prompted for a password. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. READ THIS CAREFULLY     *** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY ***     *** The password you choose here is a decoy password. That means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. Suppose that someone suspects    *** that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. THIS is the password that you    *** give to them. When you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the RIGHT password. Further, they cannot    *** even know that there is a second password.     Here are some tips for your password:     A. Choose a password you will NEVER forget. It may be ten years from now that you need it. Make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times.    B. Make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. If the password is something stupid like ""123"" then they may not believe you.    C. Remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. It is *NOT* your actual password.    D. Do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. You do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.     And with all of this in mind, choose your password. When you have typed it in twice, click ""Next"".     13. ""Large Files"", here you are asked whether or not you plan to store files larger than 4 GIGABYTES. Choose ""No"" and click ""Next""    14. ""Outer Volume Format"", here you will notice some random numbers and letters next to where it says ""Random Pool"". Go ahead and move your mouse around for    a bit. This will increase the randomness and give you better encryption. After about ten seconds of this, click ""Format"".    15. Depending on the file size you selected, it will take some time to finish formatting.     ""What is happening?""     TrueCrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as ""random.txt"". It is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. This file    system can be used to store files, directories, and more. Further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be    impossible for anyone to access it. To *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. No one will even know that    it is a truecrypt volume.     16. ""Outer Volume Contents"", click on the button called, ""Open Outer Volume""     An empty folder has opened up. This is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.     *** *** DO NOT PUT ANY SENSITIVE CONTENT HERE *** ***     This is the ""Decoy"". This is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. This is NOT where you are going to store your    sensitive data. If you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in    this folder. You need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. Here are some important    tips to keep in mind:     A. Do NOT use porn. Adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally.    B. Do NOT use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. In many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs.    C. Good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc.    D. Once you have placed files into this folder, *NEVER* place any more files in the future. Doing so may damage your hidden content.     Generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand    why you used TrueCrypt to secure that data.     Now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. Be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. The more the better.     When you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the ""x"" in the top right corner.     17. click ""Next""     18. If prompted that ""A program needs your permission to continue"", click ""Continue""    19. ""Hidden Volume"", click ""Next""    20. The default encryption and hash algorithms are fine, click ""Next""    21. ""Hidden Volume Size"", the maximum available space is indicated in bold below the text box. Round down to the nearest full unit. For example, if 19.97 GB    is available, select 19 GB. If 12.0 GB are available, select 11 GB.    22. If a warning dialog comes up, asking ""Are you sure you wish to continue"", select ""Yes""    23. ""Hidden Volume Password""     *** IMPORTANT READ THIS ***     Here you are going to select the REAL password. This is the password you will NEVER reveal to ANYONE else under any circumstances. Only you will know it. No one    will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. Be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie    to you and claim to be able to figure this out. They cannot.     It is HIGHLY recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. If it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and    simply repeat it 8 times. A date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.     24. Type in your password twice, and click ""Next""    25. ""Large Files"", select ""Yes"" and click ""Next"".    26. ""Hidden Volume Format"", as before move your mouse around for about ten seconds randomly, and tehn click ""Format"".    27. If prompted ""A program needs your permission to continue"", select ""Continue""    28. A dialog will come up telling you that the hidden TrueCrypt volume has been successfully created. Click ""Ok""    29. Click ""Exit""     Congratulations! You have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. Anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. Further,    you have protected this content with TWO passwords. One that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. Keep your real password    well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.     Now, we should test BOTH passwords.     === 5. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes ===     Once you have completed the above section, you will be back at TrueCrypt. Go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.     1. Click ""Select File...""    2. Locate the file you created in the last section, most likely called ""random.txt"" or something similar. Remember that even though there is both an outer and    a hidden volume, both volumes are contained in a single file. There are not two files, only one.    3. Click ""Open""    4. Choose a drive letter that you are not using (anything past M is probably just fine). Click on that, For example click on ""O:"" to highlight it.    5. Click ""Mount""    6. Now you are prompted for a password. Read the below carefully:     The password you provide here will determine WHICH volume is mounted to the drive letter you specified. If you type in your decoy password, then O:\ will show    all the files and directories you copied that you would reveal if forced. If you type in your real password, then O:\ will show the files and directories    that you never intend anyone to see.     7. After successfully typing in your password, you will see additional detail to the right of the drive letter, including the full path to the file you selected    as well as the kind of volume it is (for example, hidden).    8. Right click on your ""Windows Logo""/""Start Menu"" icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. You will see the    drive letter you selected, for example: ""Local Disk (O:)"". Click on that.    9. If you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. If you selected    the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.     If you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. Be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk    is not enough. We will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.     ""What is happening?""     When you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. It is the same thing as if    you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. TrueCrypt causes your computer to think that there is an    entirely new disk drive on your computer. You can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. You can copy files to it, directories, and    use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.     When you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click ""Dismount"" from within TrueCrypt    while you have the drive letter highlighted. This will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.     *** VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ***     When a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. If for example you left    your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that    volume. Therefore:     *** ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT ANY TRUECRYPT VOLUME CONTAINING ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING YOUR COMPUTER ***     You can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of ""TrueCrypt""'s control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with    no information to the right of the drive letter.     You should practice Mounting and Dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.     Once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do *NOT* touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. Remember that both volumes occupy the    same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. Once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the    installation process, that is the last time you should do so. From that point forward, use ONLY the hidden volume. The outer volume exists only as a decoy if you    need it.     === 6. Securing your Disk ===     This is an involved step which many people may not be able to do right away. If you cannot do this step immediately, then see section 7.     At this point you should understand how to create and use TrueCrypt hidden volumes in order to safeguard any sensitive information. Therefore, you should *NOT*    keep any such sensitive information on your hard disk. At this stage, there are two possibilities:     1. You have never had any sensitive information on your hard disk. In this case, read this section but you can certainly skip it.    2. Up until now, you have stored sensitive information on your hard disk. If so, then you MUST read this section.     If you have ever used this computer to access sensitive information, then all of the security and precautions in the world are totally useless and futile because    all someone has to do is access what is left of that sensitive information. I cannot stress this enough.     You can have the most secure TrueCrypt volumes, use TOR, and be the safest most secure user in the world. If you have not made sure that *ALL* remnants of any    sensitive information are UTTERLY REMOVED from your hard disk, then all of that effort is totally pointless. You MUST take these actions to safeguard your    hard disk, or otherwise you might as well throw away this guide and follow none of the advice herein.     First, I understand that it is troublesome to have to re-format a computer, to back everything up, and reinstall everything. However, if you have ever had    sensitive information on your machine, that is what you have to do. Take the following steps:     1. Obtain a removable harddrive or usb flash drive large enough to store anything you need to save.    2. Set up a truecrypt hidden volume on that harddrive big enough to hold all of that information.    3. Set up the truecrypt outer volume as in the previous section. Use the previous section as a guide if you need to.    4. Be sure you the hidden volume will have enough space to store all that you are backing up.    5. Copy ALL data you need to back up/save into that hidden volume.     *** IMPORTANT, READ THIS ***     If you have ever used this system to access sensitive information, then you must assume that the sensitive information or remnants of it can be *anywhere* on    your hard disk. Therefore, you need to move *EVERYTHING* you intend to save into the hidden truecrypt container. You do not know where sensitive data might    be, so you are assuming it can be anywhere. This way you still have ALL of your data and you have lost nothing.     A good analogy is toxic waste. You don't know which barrel might contain the toxic waste, so you treat *ALL* the barrels as potentially toxic. This is the    surest way you can protect yourself.     You might be saying, ""I have family photos, music, movies that I would have to move to the hidden volume."" That is perfectly fine. Remember that you can access    that hidden volume just as if it was a drive letter. In fact, ideally, *ALL* of the content on your computer (assuming you value your privacy) should be    protected anyways. You lose nothing by securing all of that data.     6. Once you have copied everything you intend to copy. dismount your hidden volume, reboot your computer, and re-mount your hidden volume to make sure everything is there.    7. Now it is time to re-format your entire hard drive. Re-install your operating system of choice (such as Windows 7), and start with a clean slate.    8. Once you have reinstalled your operating system from scratch, follow sections one through five of this guide to reach this point, and then proceed.     === 7. Temporarily Securing Your Disk, Shredding Free Space ===     Like the previous section, this section applies ONLY IF there is some risk that sensitive data has ever been stored or accessed on this computer. If you are 100% sure    that sensitive information has never been accessed using this computer, then you can safely skip this and the previous step.     If you are not prepared to take the actions in the previous step yet, then you should follow the steps in this section until you can. However, you MUST    eventually take the actions in step six above. Do not assume you can find/delete all sensitive content. Lists of filenames, image thumbnails, random    data, and more *ARE* sitting on your hard disk. Someone who knows how to find it, WILL. That will render all of your other precautions totally futile.     As soon as you can, follow the instructions in step six.     Meanwhile, here is how you can temporarily safeguard yourself until you are able to follow those instructions.     1. Go through your hard disk folder by folder, deleting (or moving to a truecrypt hidden volume) any files that you believe are sensitive/risky.    2. When you are totally sure that you have deleted all such files, go to the following URL: http://www.fileshredder.org    3. Scroll down and look for the button called ""Download File Shredder"" -- do NOT click any other button, as the page may have ads on it that appear to be download links.    4. Save the file.    5. Run the file, most likely titled: file_shredder_setup.exe    6. ""Welcome to the File Shredder Setup Wizard"", Click ""Next""    7. Select ""I accept the agreement"" and click ""Next""    8. It will choose where to install it, click ""Next""    9. Click ""Next"" again when prompted for the Start Menu folder.    10. ""Select Additional Tasks"", Click ""Next"" again    11. Click ""Install""    12. Ensuring that ""Launch File Shredder"" is checked, click ""Finish""    13. You should now notice that ""File Shredder"" is running. You should see the program in your task bar. Click on it to bring up the control panel if it is not up already.    14. On the left is a link that says ""Shred Free Disk Space"", click it.    15. Choose the drive letter for your hard disk, typically C:\, as well as any other drives you wish to shred the free space.    16. under ""Select Secure Algorithm"", select ""Secure Erasing Algorithm with 7 passes"" and click ""Next""    17. Click ""Start""     This will take some time to finish. Once you have finished shredding your free disk space, it will be impossible or nearly impossible for someone to find one of your    deleted files and piece it back together to see what it once was. However, this is NOT enough.     Keep in mind that there may still be records of the filenames that were deleted, partial data from those files, image thumbnails, and more that may be enough to    incriminate you. This is only a temporary step you have taken, and you absolutely must take the actions in step 6 above in order to be truly safe. it exceeded the maximum charictor count, so I am breaking it into two posts.     === 8. Installing VirtualBox     And now we get to the fun part. We are going to create a secure environment for you to browse the internet and communicate in a way that is totally anonymous and    untracable. You will have a setup that is so secure as to be virtually impossible to break.     1. First, go to the following URL: http://www.virtualbox.org    2. Select ""Downloads"" in the menu on the left    3. Under ""VirtualBox platform packages"" is ""VirtualBox 4.0.4 for Windows Hosts"", next to that is ""x86/amd64"". Click that.    4. Save the file. It should be titled similar to: ""VirtualBox-4.0.4-7011-Win.exe    5. Run the file.    6. ""Welcome to the Oracle VM... Setup Wizard"", Click ""Next""    7. click ""Next""    8. Click ""Next""    9. ""Warning: Network Interfaces"", click ""Yes"" but be aware that your internet connection will be temporarily reset for a few seconds.    10. Click ""Install""    11. A dialog saying ""A program needs your permission to continue"" may appear, click ""Continue"".    12. One or more dialogs asking if you want to install ""device software"" may come up, select ""Install"" each time.    13. Optionally check the box ""Always trust software from Oracle Corporation.""    14. ""Oracle VM... installation is complete"", Click ""Finish"" ensuring that ""Start Oracle VM after installation"" is checked.     Now we have the software we need in order to set up and run virtual machines. On your task bar to the far right, you should notice VirtualBox running. Click    on the ""VirtualBox"" icon if needed in order to bring the VirtualBox control panel into view.     Now it is time to set up a virtual machine. For this, we need to obtain two files. Operating systems, such as windows, are typically installed using a cd or    dvd. You put the cd or dvd into your computer, you boot it up, and you follow the instructions in order to install the operating system. Virtual machines    work similarly. Before we can use a virtual machine, we have to install an operating system on it.     However, we are *NOT* going to use Windows! We are going to use Linux. Do not be afraid if you have no experience using Linux. I assure you that this will    prove to be painless. We actually need two different linux operating systems in order to have a secure system. Before we go through the steps of setting this    up, I want to describe to you what we are doing.     Remember earlier in the guide I explained that one of the downsides to using Tor Browser from your main computer is that you might accidentally put a link    into a non-Tor browser. The problem with your computer right now is that you can access tor sites, or non-tor sites equally well. That means that you have    to be extremely careful to ensure that you are using Tor.     An analogy would be to say that you are typing on a keyboard with red and green keys. You have to be careful to only hit the green keys. If you accidentally    hit a red key, then you could compromise your security and anonymity. That is *not* a good position to be in. The purpose of setting up a virtual machine is    to make certain that you cannot accidentally reveal your identity or compromise your security.     The computer you are using now has two ways of accessing the internet: TOR, and Non-TOR. The virtual machine we are setting up however will only be able to    access the internet using TOR. No other way period. That means that no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you will NOT be able to accidentally    access any website except through TOR. This *guarantees* that whatever you do on that virtual machine is going to be through TOR.     So how do we achieve this? There are a number of ways to do so. The method presented in this guide is not the only good way, however I do believe that it is    both easy to set up and also friendly to users who may not have a great deal of RAM.     First, we are going to set up two different virtual machines. One of them will exist for the sole purpose of making sure that the other one does not accidentally    connect to the internet except through TOR. This virtual machine requires very little. You will not be using it for anything. It will simply act as a gatekeeper    to ensure that the other Virtual Machine is safe.     The second virtual machine will be what you use for internet browsing, chatting, etc. This virtual machine will be configured in such a way that it can only use    TOR and nothing else. The way we will achieve this is to force this second virtual machine to go through the first virtual machine for all internet connections.     Do not worry if this seems complicated. As with the rest of this guide, I am going to walk you through step by step exactly what to do.     First, we have to obtain the operating systems we will need. In this case, we are going to use ""Damn Small Linux"" (yes that is it's real name) for the firewall and    we are going to use ""Ubuntu"" for the main system. The advantage to using ""Damn Small Linux"" is that we only need 32 MB of ram and no disk sapce to have an effective    firewall.     Let's set up the firewall first:  === 9. Installing a Firewall ===     1. First, go to the following URL: http://www.damnsmalllinux.org (three l's)    2. Scroll down until you see a link that says ""Download""    3. Under ""Current Full Mirror List"", click any that work. Some may not work at any given time. If one doesn't work, simply hit back on your browser and try another one.    4. At the time of this guide, the following url worked: ftp://ftp.is.co.za/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/    5. Go to the ""current"" directory if not already in it.    6. Click on the file called: dsl-4.4.10.iso -- If you cannot find this file, choose the file closet to it. A higher version number is fine. The file will probably be about 50 MB    7. The file should take about 5-10 minutes to download based on your connection.     ( IF THE ABOVE STEPS WORKED FOR YOU, SKIP THIS MINI-SECTION    (    ( If you had trouble with the above steps, read this mini-section    (    ( With mirrors, it is often the case that a particular mirror site doesn't work. At the time of this writing, several mirrors worked.

Click ""New"" at the top left, an icon that resembles a many-pointed round star.    9. ""Welcome to the New Virtual Machine Wizard"", click ""Next""    10. ""VM Name and OS Type"": Under ""Name"" type in: Firewall    11. For Operating System, choose ""Linux""    12. For ""Version"", choose: ""Other Linux""    13. Click ""Next""    14. ""Memory"", select ""32 MB"" and click Next    15. ""Virtual Hard Disk"", Uncheck ""Boot Hard Disk"" and click ""Next""    16. If a Warning dialog appears, click ""Continue""    17. Click ""Finish""    18. Now you will notice ""Firewall, Powered Off"" visible in your VirtualBox control panel. Make sure it is highlighted (it should be) and then right click it, and select ""Settings"".    19. Select ""Network"" in the menu to the left.    20. Click on the ""Adapter 2"" tab.    21. Check ""Enable Network Adapter"" and next to where it says ""Attached to"", select ""Internal Network"" from the pulldown menu.    22. Click ""Ok"" at the bottom.    23. Once again, right click ""Firewall, Powered Off"" and select ""Start""    24. Check ""Do not show this message again"" and click ""Ok"". This is just letting you know that the ""RIGHT CTRL KEY"" on your keyboard is the ""control"" key for this virtual machine.    25. ""Welcome to the First Run Wizard"", click ""Next""    26. ""Select Installation Media"", under ""Media Source"" is a pull down menu. To the immediate right of that pull down menu is an icon with a folder. Click that folder icon.    27. Locate ""current.iso"" or ""dsl-4.4.10.iso"" (or the similar file name) that you downloaded. When located, click ""Open"". It is likely in the ""Downloads"" directory of your home folder.    28. Click ""Next""    29. Click ""Finish""     Now the virtual machine will start to boot up. Simply wait... (This may take up to 5 minutes.)     30. One or more new dialogs may come up saying ""VirtualBox Information"", just click ""Do not show this message again"" and click ""Ok""     After a few minutes, the booting will finish and you will be looking at the desktop for your firewall virtual machine. To the right of the window you will see    some stats that look something like this:     Up: 0 k/s - Down: 0 k/s    Processes: 19    CPU Usage: 10%    RAM Usage: 16.2MB/28.8MB     etc.     Congratulations! You now have a firewall running. Now we will set up this firewall to protect you so that you can safely use TOR from your main virtual machine.     === 10. Firewall Configuration ===     At this stage you should be looking at the desktop for ""DSL"" (Damn Small Linux).     I need to talk about the mouse first. This particular virtual machine as well as your main operating system (windows) both want control of your mouse. Both cannot have control    of your mouse at the same time however. Therefore, you have to choose whether the mouse will be used by your virtual machine, or by Windows. When you click into your virtual    machine, it has the effect of passing control of the mouse to the virtual machine. That means you cannot move your mouse cursor past the boundaries of that virtual machine. In    order to give mouse control back to windows, enabling you to move your mouse cursor anywhere, simply press the right ctrl key on your keyboard. That is to say, you have two ctrl    keys. One on the left of your keyboard, and one on the right. Press the ctrl key that is on the right of your keyboard. This will give mouse control back to windows.     Practice this a bit. Practice clicking into the window, moving the mouse cursor around, pressing right ctrl, and moving the windows mouse cursor around. Get the feel of it.     You should see a window that looks something like a web browser, with some text in it including words such as ""Getting Started with DSL"". First, close that window.     ( If your mouse is not working, read this mini-section.    (    ( First, click inside the window that your virtual machine is running in. Now try moving your mouse cursor. If you do not see the mouse cursor moving around, then press    ( RIGHT CTRL + I. Now move your mouse cursor again. If you notice that you are moving your ""main"" mouse cursor over the window, but you do not see the ""DSL"" black mouse    ( cursor moving, then click again into that window. If you do this a few times, you should notice that the mouse begins to work. You may have to press RIGHT CTRL+I a couple    ( of times to get the mouse to work.     1. Once the mouse is working inside of your virtual machine, go ahead and close the window entitled ""Getting Started with DSL""     ( If you cannot see the full virtual machine window, for example because your screen resolution is set so that some of the window goes too low, read this mini-section.    (    ( First, press RIGHT CTRL+I until you have your main windows white mouse cursor back. Now, click on ""Machine"" in the menu at the top of the window.    ( Select ""Switch to Scale Mode""    (    ( Click ""Switch""    (    ( Now you will have converted your firewall window to a smaller size, and you will be able to resize it. You may need to press ""right ctrl"" to get a windows mouse cursor    ( which you will need in order to resize this window. Now simply resize it to the size that works for you, and then click into the window to be able to use the black mouse    ( cursor inside the virtual machine. I recommend you maximize this window to make sure you can read everything clearly.     2. Right click anywhere on the desktop, go to System (a red folder), go to Daemons, ssh, and start.    3. Right click again anywhere on the desktop, go to XShells -> Root Access -> Transparent     4. Now you have a window that you can type in. Type exactly as shown below into this window, and hit enter:     passwd     Once you type this and hit enter, it will ask you for a password. This is a password for full access to the firewall. Make it at least 8 characters in size.     *** IMPORTANT: Do not forget your firewall password. You will need it later in the guide. ***     When you have successfully changed your password, it will say ""Password changed.""     5. Now type exactly as shown below, into the same window:     ifconfig eth1 10.0.3.1     6. It will not say anything after you hit enter, it will just return you back to the prompt.     Now our firewall server is ready. We want to save this state so that we can get back to it easy in the future.    Press RIGHT CTRL+S     7. Now you will be looking at a window that says ""Take Snapshot of Virtual Machine"". Just click ""Ok""     8. Now, let's test this out to confirm it works as we expect. Go ahead and close the virtual machine by clicking the ""X"" in the top right corner. A menu will come up. Select    ""Power off the machine"" and click ok. Do NOT check the box called ""Restore current snapshot"".     And now you should be once again at the VirtualBox manager. You will see ""Firewall(Shapshot 1), Powered Off""     9. Make sure that ""Firewall (Snapshot 1), Powered Off"" is selected. At the top right of your VirtualBox Manager is a button that says: ""Snapshots (1)"". Click it.    10. Click on ""Snapshot 1"", the top-most selection. This will highlight it.    11. Now right click it, and click on ""Restore Snapshot""    12. A dialog box will come up asking if you are sure, click ""Restore""    13. Now click the ""Start"" button at the top with the large green arrow.    14. Any dialog boxes that come up with a check box saying ""Do not show this information again"", simply check the check-box, and click ok. Do not worry about any of those.     Remember, if you do not have immediate control of the mouse inside the virtual machine, simply press RCTRL+I (press right ctrl and ""I"" at the same time) and click into it until you have mouse control.    Now your firewall is good to go. Any time you need it, just go to the VirtualBox Manager and follow steps 9 through 14 above. You do not have to go through the whole setup    process again at any time in the future. Your firewall is ready.     === 11. Installing Ubuntu ===     Now we are going to set up the main machine that you will be using TOR with.     1. First, go to this URL: http://www.ubuntu.com     2. Click on the link ""Download Ubuntu""    3.     Click ""Start Download"" (This download should take 10-15 minutes)    4. The filename is going to be similar to: ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso     Now we wait...     While you are waiting for the file to download, go ahead and make sure that your ""hidden volume"" is mounted in TrueCrypt to a particular drive letter. For example, O:    You will need that for the next step.     5. Return to your ""VirtualBox Manager"". It doesn't matter if the firewall is running or not.    6. Click ""New"" (the blue round star-icon in the top left) again.    7. ""Welcome to the New Virtual Machine Wizard"", click ""Next""    8. ""VM Name and OS Type"", under ""Name"", type ""Primary""    9. Next to ""Operating System"", select ""Linux""    10. Next to ""Version"", select ""Ubuntu"" and Click ""Next""    11. ""Memory"", by default it selects 512 MB. This is fine. 256 MB is the MINIMUM. The more memory you allocate, the better the virtual machine will function. Click ""Next""    12. ""Virtual Hard Disk"", Make sure ""Boot Hard Disk"" is checked. Make sure ""Create new hard disk"" is selected. Click ""Next""    13. ""Welcome to the Create New Virtual Disk Wizard"", click ""Next""    14. ""Hard Disk Storage Type"", select ""Fixed-size storage"" and click ""Next""    15. ""Virtual Disk Location and Size"", to the right of the text box containing ""Primary"" is a folder icon. Click the folder icon.    16. Now we have to select a file for the new hard disk image file. On the bottom of this dialog it says ""Browse Folders"", click on that.    17. Now click on ""Computer"" in the menu to the left.    18. Scroll to where you see the drive letter you mounted, and double click on it. Ex: Local Disk (O:)    19. Now click ""Save""    20. By default 8.00 GB are selected. That is fine. If you have enough space on your hidden volume, increase this to 10 GB. Otherwise, 8 is fine.    21. Under ""Location"", it should say O:\Primary.vdi where O: is replaced by whatever drive letter you mounted your TrueCrypt hidden volume to.    22. Click ""Next"", then click ""Finish""     Now we wait for VirtualBox to create the hard drive we asked for. This may take a few minutes.     Keep in mind this entire virtual machine as well as any of its contents are going to reside within the hidden truecrypt container. This ensures extra security.     23. When this is done, you will see a ""Summary"" window. Click ""Finish"".     24. Now, right click on ""Primary, Powered Off"" in your ""VirtualBox Manager"", and click ""Start""    25. Again we are at the ""First Run Wizard"", click ""Next""    26. ""Select Installation Media"", under ""Media Source"" is a pull down menu. Click the ""folder icon"" to the immediate right of that pulldown menu.    27. Locate ""ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386"" (or the similarly named file) from your Downloads directory, or wherever you saved it. Click on it, and click ""Open""    28. Click ""Next""    29. Click ""Finish""     Now simply wait. Your Ubuntu virtual machine will be loading up. This may take a few minutes. Don't worry if you see all kinds of strange messages/text. It is normal.     After a few minutes, you should start to see the Ubuntu desktop load. Unlike your firewall, you will notice that you do not have to click the mouse inside the window. It    automatically happens. This is going to be much easier than the ""Firewall"" step.     Once everything has loaded, you will be looking at a window that says ""Install"" with a button that says ""Install Ubuntu"". If you cannot see everything, press RCTRL+F (to go full screen). You can return to windowed mode by RCTRL+F again. Any dialogs can be closed, and you can check the box that says ""Do not show me this again.""     30. Click ""Install Ubuntu""    31. Check ""Download updates while installing""    32. Check ""Install this third-party software"". Click ""Forward""    33. Ensure ""Erase and use entire disk"" is selected, and click ""Forward"". Remember, this is NOT talking about your hard disk. It is talking about the 8-10 gigabyte virtual disk.    34. Click ""Install Now""    35. Now you will be guided through a series of installation related screens. The first screen asks you to select your timezone/time. Select your choice and click ""Forward""    36. Now keyboard layout, again select your choice and click Forward. If you are unsure, leave it as is or click ""Figure out keyboard layout""    37. ""Who are you?"" For ""Your name"" type in: mainuser    38. When you type in ""mainuser"" the other boxes will fill in automatically. Now click in the text box next to ""Choose a password"".    39. Do NOT use the same password as the firewall. Come up with a different password.    40. Ensure that ""Require my password to log in"" as well as ""Encrypt my home folder"" are selected and checked and proceed.     Now simply wait until the installation is finished. The installation may take a while, and it may appear to stall at some points. As long as the ubuntu mouse cursor shows an    animation that is turning around in circles, the installation *is* working. Simply wait until it is done. If after an hour or two the progress bar hasn't moved at all, then go    ahead and re-start the installation starting from step 24 (after closing the window and powering down the virtual machine).     Depending on your computer, it could take 2-4 hours. Most likely, it will take about an hour. Once finished, you will see a dialog that says ""Installation Complete"" with    a button that says ""Reboot Now"". Do NOT press the ""Reboot Now"" button. Close the 'X' on this window, and Power Down.     41. Now, right click ""Primary"" and go to ""Settings"".    42. Click on ""Storage"" in the left menu. Then click on the ""ubuntu-10.10... .iso"" under where it says ""IDE Controller""    43. To the right it says ""Attributes"" under that it says ""CD/DVD Drive : ..."" to the immediate right of that is a cd icon. Click it.    44. Select ""Remove disk from virtual drive.""    45. Click ""Ok""    46. Now, making sure that ""Primary"" is highlighted, click the ""Start"" button at the top with the large green arrow.     Now we wait for your newly installed Ubuntu machine to boot up.     47. After a few minutes, you will see a dialog appear that says ""mainuser-VirtualBox"". Go ahead and click on ""mainuser"" which has the ""person icon"" to the left of it.    48. Now it will prompt you for your password. Enter the password you used in the installation process.    49. After a minute or so, you should hear a nice login sound, and you should be fully logged into your virtual machine.    50. Keep waiting, and a dialog will appear that says ""Information avialable"" and ""Record your encryption passphrase"" Click on: ""Run this action now""    51. Type in the same password you used to log in. After that window closes, click ""Close"" in the dialog box.     Congratulations! You have now set up a virtual machine as well as a firewall to protect it. Now we need to finish configuring the primary virtual machine.     === 12. Ubuntu Initial Setup ===     Ok, now that we have installed Ubuntu, we need to set it up so that we can use it fully. This also means making sure we can see flash on websites such as youtube.     1. First, we have to install any updates that are pending. At the bottom of your screen, you should notice where it says ""Update Manager"". Click on that.    2. Now, click on ""Install Updates"". If you did not see ""Update Manager"", then skip these two steps.    3. Any time an administrative task is required, you will need to type in your password. This is the same password you used to log in.     Now we wait, this is going to download any necessary security updates to make certain we are using the most current/secure setup possible. This may require downloading    hundreds of megabytes. Just go ahead and let it do that, and when everything is downloaded and updated, proceed to the next step. While you wait, Ubuntu may go into    screensaver mode. If so, just move the mouse and it will ask you for your password. That will leave screensaver mode.     If the updates are more than a hundred megabytes, it will take quite a while. It may take up to 2-3 hours depending on your computer and internet connection. Nonetheless, this    step is critical. Do not skip the updates. Besides ensuring that your setup will be secure, the updates also ensure that all of the applications are up to date and thus    most likely to function correctly. Just go ahead and watch a movie for a couple hours, and then return and check on it.     After all of the updates have been downloaded and installed, the ""Update Manager"" window will now say ""Your system is up-to-date"" at the top. Further, it will say: ""The    computer needs to restart to finish installing updates."". Go ahead and press the 'X' in the top right corner of the window, and choose 'Send the shutdown signal"". If prompted, click ""Shut Down"". Once it has fully shut down, the window will disappear and you will be back at the VirtualBox manager. Go ahead and right click on ""Primary"" and click ""Start"".    This will restart the virtual machine.     If a virtual machine fails to shutdown after 10 minutes or so, then go ahead and close the window again by pressing the 'X' but this time choose ""Power down"". If it still will    not shut down, then VirtualBox may have crashed. If so, just follow these instructions:     ( Follow the steps in this mini-section if a virtual machine fails to shutdown, or you need to completely close/restart VirtualBox.    (    ( First, press ""Ctrl+Alt+Delete"", and then click ""Task Manager""    ( Next, locate the process that is running that starts with ""VirtualBox"". Right click that process, and click ""End Process Tree""    ( This should force the window to close.    (    ( Now, restart VirtualBox by going to your start menu, All Programs, Oracle VM VirtualBox VirtualBOx    (    ( Now you will have the VirtualBox manager up again. To restart the Ubuntu machine, simply right click on ""Primary"" and click ""Start"".     Once your Primary vm has rebooted, you will be again at the login screen. Here as before, click on ""mainuser"" and then enter in your password. Now your primary machine is fully    up to date. Remember, be patient. It may take a few minutes before your virtual machine has fully booted. First you will see the background image and a mouse cursor that can move    around, next you should hear the login sound play, and finally you will see the menu at the top and bottom of your virtual machine window. Depending on the speed of your computer,    this may take 10 minutes or more. Just be patient. Don't worry if your virtual machine appears to be running too slow, we will speed it up.     Now your Virtual Machine is set up and ready for use.     === 13. Installing Guest Additions ===     In order to ensure that the Virtual Machine runs smoothly as possible, we are going to install some additional software to the virtual machine.     1. Go to the ""Devices"" menu at the top of your virtual machine main window (Machine, Devices, Help), and go to ""Install Guest Additions""    2. Go to the ""Places"" menu at the top of your virtual machine (Applications, Places, System), and click on ""VBOXADDITIONS_4.0.4_70112"" (the number may be different).    3. At the top this new window will be the text ""The media has been determined as ""UNIX software"". Click on ""Open Autorun Prompt""    4. A new dialog may appear saying ""This medium contains software intended to be automatically started. Would you like to run it?"" Click ""Run""    5. Enter your administrative password (the one you use to log into Ubuntu) and click ""Ok""    6. Now the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer will begin. This may take some time, so just relax and wait. Depending on your computer, this may take 30 minutes or more.    7. When this is finished, you will see the text ""Press Return to close this window."" Go ahead and do so.    8. Once that window has closed, go ahead and press the 'X' to close the entire virtual machine window. Select ""Send the shutdown signal"" and click ""Ok"".    9. A dialog box will appear. Click on ""Shut Down"", the top most option.     At this stage it is a good idea to further optimise our virtual machine. When you initially installed it, you most likely selected either 256 MB or 512 MB of RAM. If you    have enough RAM to spare, then I highly recommend you increase that to at least 1 GB. Here is how to do so:     1. First, right click on ""Primary, Powered off"" and go to Settings.    2. Select ""System"" from the menu on the left.    3. Increase the ""Base Memory"" to either 1024 MB (1 GB), or some higher value you are comfortable with.     It is also a good idea to increase the video memory available to the virtual machine.     4. Select ""Display"" from the menu on the left, still inside of ""Settings""    5. Increase the ""Video Memory"" slider to the right as far as you are comfortable with. For example, 128 MB.    6. Check the box ""Enable 3D Acceleration"".    7. Now click ""Ok"" at the bottom.     Go ahead and start up Ubuntu again by right clicking ""Primary, Powered off"" and clicking ""Start""     When Ubuntu loads up, go ahead and log in as before using your password. Now wait until Ubuntu is fully booted and the ""Applications Places System"" menu is visible.     You will probably notice that your virtual machine loads up and runs faster than before.     How well your virtual machine runs depends on how good your computer is. Primarily, RAM and processor speed are the most significant factors. If your computer is    modern enough, you should be able to use websites with flash and even watch videos, such as on YouTube, with no problem. If your computer is not as modern, you will    still be able to browse websites but may not be able to watch videos. You should still be able to use most flash based websites however.     *** IMPORTANT: Do NOT browse sensitive content YET. At this stage, your virtual machine is not yet configured to use TOR. ***     === 14. Installing IRC (Optional) ===     *** This section is entirely optional. If you are not interested in installing IRC, skip this section. ***     To install IRC on your new virtual machine, follow these steps:     1. Go to the ""Applications"" menu, and go to ""Ubuntu Software Center""    2. Type ""kvirc"" in the search box field in the top right.    3. When the results return, select the one called: ""KDE-based next generation IRC client"" or ""KV Irc"".    4. Click ""Install""    5. Enter your password when prompted.    6. While it installs, you will notice a progress bar. This may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your internet connection.    7. Once it is finished installing, the progress bar will go away. Go ahead and close the ""Ubuntu Software Center"".     You are probably used to the close/min/max buttons being on the top right, as is the case in Windows. You will find them in the top left instead. If you don't like    this, don't worry. You can change it later.     Now, let's go ahead and set up KVIrc.     Remember, you are NOT truly anonymous yet.     8. Click on ""Applications"" in the top menu.    9. Go to ""Internet""    10. Click on ""KVIrc""    11. ""KVIrc Setup"" will appear. Go ahead and click ""Next"" to begin.    12. ""Store Configuration in Folder"", click ""Next""    13. ""Please choose a Nickname"". You can leave this exactly as is, or you can choose a Nick name then click ""Next"".     *** IMPORTANT READ THIS ***     Do NOT pick a nick name you have ever used before, or a nick name that can help someone determine who you are.    Also, do NOT fill in any other details such as location, age, real name, etc. Leave everything else as is.     You are NOT anonymous yet.     14. Now you are asked to pick a theme, select ""No theme"" then click ""Next""    15. Now click ""Finish"" to leave the KVIrc Setup    16. A new window will appear having a list of servers, click ""Close""     Now let's connect to the ""Freenode"" IRC network. By now, you may have many questions about how to use Ubuntu. The #Ubuntu chatroom on Freenode is a great place to    start, and where you can ask questions related to how to use Ubuntu and VirtualBox. Please remember, you are NOT anonymous yet and anything you say can be matched    to your IP address. Keep the conversation related to technical help, or just learning Ubuntu.     Do NOT discuss TOR.    Do NOT discuss ANY sensitive material.     Remember, this chatroom consists mostly of people who have set up Ubuntu for other reasons. Therefore, they will be able to help you configure it, and answer many    questions about how Ubuntu works.     17. At the bottom right of KVIrc is a long text input box. Click inside that box.    18. Type, exactly as shown below, including the ""/"" character:     /server irc.freenode.net 6667     19. This will connect you to the Freenode IRC network. After a few minutes, you will be connected and a dialog box will appear.    20. Uncheck the box that says ""Show this window after connecting"", and then click ""Close""    21. Now, in the same text box as you typed the /server command, type the following exactly as shown below, including the ""/"" and ""#"" characters:     /join #Ubuntu     22. Now you are in the #Ubuntu chatroom. Feel free to discuss the Ubuntu operating system and ask questions related to how to use Ubuntu. Remember:     *** Do NOT discuss TOR or sensitive material. You are NOT anonymous. ***     This is a good opportunity for you to learn how to set up Ubuntu to be the way you want as far as colors, layout, theme and so forth. When you have finished, simply    close the ""KVIrc"" window.     === 15. Installing Torchat (optional) ===     *** This section is entirely optional. If you are not interested in installing Torchat, skip this section. ***     Torchat is a program you can use to communicate securely and anonymously with other Torchat users. It is only useful if you already know someone who is using it. If    you do not know someone using Torchat, then it is best to skip this section and come back to it in the future when you want to install Torchat.     These instructions work for Ubuntu 10.10.     First, installing Torchat is a bit tricky because Ubuntu does not include Tor by default in its repositories. Tor is a requirement for torchat, and therefore we have    to first install Tor on Ubuntu. Doing so is not too difficult.     1. First, go to ""Applications"" -> ""Accessories"" -> ""Terminal"". You will see a new window appear with a prompt that looks like this:     mainuser@mainuser-VirtualBox:~$     2. Now, type exactly as shown below, and hit enter:     sudo bash     3. After entering your password, you will be at a new prompt which looks like this:     root@mainuser-VirtualBox:~#     4. Now, either type or copy-paste the below text into this window and then hit enter:     echo ""deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org experimental-lucid main"" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 886DDD89     5. After you do this, you should see the following at the bottom of your window:     gpg: Total number processed: 1    gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)     6. Now, we should be able to install tor. In this same window, type the following commands, one at a time:     apt-get update    apt-get install vidalia privoxy tor     7. (press Y and enter when prompted)     Now we need to obtain the Torchat installation file, follow these steps:     8. In firefox on Ubuntu, go to the following URL: http://code.google.com/p/torchat    9. On the left under where it says ""Downloads""    10. One of the files listed will end in .deb, for example torchat-0.9.9.deb. Click on that file name.    11. On the next page, again click on the file name. This should begin the file download.    12. By default, Ubuntu wants to open this file using the ""Ubuntu Software Center"". This is correct.     Now wait until the file finishes downloading, and then the ""Ubuntu Software Center"" will appear. Follow these steps:     1. Press ""Install""    2. Type in your password when prompted.     After a short wait, Torchat will be installed.     To start Torchat, go to ""Applications"" -> ""Internet"" -> ""Torchat Instant Messenger""     =========================================    http://www.whatis-theplan.org/t10808p15-operation-reverse-graffiti     how-to LEGALLY do graffities for the plan whereever you want ^^     Toolbox for translators : http://www.whatis-theplan.org/t11554-translators-toolbox     === 16. Creating TOR-Only Internet Environment ===     Up until now, we have been using our Virtual Machine to access the internet directly. This was necessary so that we could install updates, software, and    get a feel for how to use Ubuntu.     Now it is time to force Ubuntu to connect to the internet using TOR Only. At the end of this phase, your Ubuntu virtual machine will be usable as a secure    and anonymous TOR based browsing environment. It will be *impossible* for you to access the internet except through TOR, and therefore you can rest assured    that anything at all you do online through the Ubuntu virtual machine will be through TOR.     First, we need to shut down any running virtual machines. If ""Primary"" is running, click the 'X' in the top right to close it. Select ""Send shutdown signal""    and then select ""Shut Down"" when prompted. If ""Firewall"" is running, go ahead and close it in the same way, but choose ""Power off"".     After a minute or so, you should be back to your VirtualBox Manager, with neither virtual machine running.     1. Right click on ""Primary, Powered Off"" and go to ""Settings""    2. Select ""Network"" from the menu on the left.    3. Next to ""Attached to"" is a pull down menu. Right now it is set to ""NAT"". Choose ""Internal Network"" and click ""Ok""    4. Click ""Firewall"" to highlight it, and then click on ""Snapshots (1)"" in the top right.    5. Right click on ""Snapshot 1"" and then select ""Restore Snapshot"". Select ""Restore"" if prompted.    6. Right click ""Firewall"" and click ""Start""     Now your Firewall will be resumed exactly where it had been previously set up. The last command entered should still be visible.     Before you proceed, make sure that TOR is running on your main Windows computer. If it is, you will see an ""Onion"" icon visible in your task bar. Click on that    icon and you should see the ""Vidalia Control Panel"". Make sure that it says ""Connected to the TOR Network"". If so, you are ready to proceed. If not then please    see section 2 : ""Using and Testing Tor Browser for the first time"" to re-start TOR. Once TOR is running, proceed.     Let's restart Ubuntu:     7. Right click ""Primary"" and click Start. Log in as normal.    8. After fully logged in, open ""Firefox"" by clicking the orange ""Firefox"" logo at the top, next to ""System"".    9. Try to go to any website, such as www.google.com. Try at least 3-5 different websites. You should not be able to connect to any of them.     Note: If you attempt to go to websites you have already been to using Ubuntu, they may appear to load because they are cached.     10. In Firefox on Ubuntu, go to ""Edit"" and ""Preferences""    11. Click on the ""Advanced"" icon    12. Click on the ""Network"" tab    13. Under ""Connection"" it says ""Configure how Firefox connects to the internet"". To the right of that is a ""Settings"" button. Click that button.    14. Select ""Manual proxy configuration""    15. Next to both ""HTTP Proxy"" and ""SSL Proxy"" type in: 127.0.0.1    16. Set the port to 8118 for both ""HTTP Proxy"" and ""SSL Proxy""    17. Next to ""SOCKS Host"" type: 127.0.0.1    18. Set the port for ""SOCKS Host"" to 9050    19. Make sure that ""SOCKS v5"" is selected at the bottom.    20. Click ""Ok"" and then ""Close""     Now we have instructed Firefox to use TOR. However, Firefox cannot use TOR yet. Right now, Ubuntu is completely unable to connect to the Internet. We    are going to change that.     21. Go to ""Applications"" -> ""Accessories"" -> ""Terminal""    22. Type in: sudo bash (and hit enter)    23. Type in your password if prompted.    24. Type in the following commands exactly as shown below (or copy paste them):     ifconfig eth0 10.0.3.2    /etc/init.d/polipo stop    /etc/init.d/tor stop    /etc/init.d/privoxy stop     (Note: the last three commands, those beginning with /etc/ are only necessary if you installed Torchat)     Now you have told your Ubuntu machine to join the same network that your Firewall is on. Now we can establish a tunnel for TOR data to flow from our    Ubuntu machine, through the Firewall, into your Windows guest machine. We need to establish two such tunnels.     The first tunnel for port 9050 data, and the second tunnel for port 8118 data. When these two tunnels are set up, it will be possible for you to use    your Ubuntu machine to access any website using TOR. Further, it is still completely impossible for your Ubuntu machine to access the Internet in any    other way.     25. Your terminal window should still be open. Type in the following command exactly as shown (or copy paste it):     ssh -N -L 9050:10.0.2.2:9050 root@10.0.3.1     26. Type ""yes"" if prompted. When prompted for the password, give your Firewall password. Not your Ubuntu password.     After you hit enter, you will see the cursor go to a blank line and nothing else happens. This simply means the connection you requested is active. If the    connection were to stop for any reason, you would return to a command prompt. If you want to terminate the connection yourself, simply hit CTRL+C. You can    type in the same ssh command again if you need to re-open the tunnel.     27. Now we are going to open the second tunnel. In your terminal window, go to ""File"" and ""Open Tab"". This will open up a tab for a second terminal without    affecting the first.    28. Now, type exactly as shown below to open the second tunnel:     ssh -N -L 8118:10.0.2.2:8118 root@10.0.3.1     29. Return to Firefox. Go to the ""File"" menu and uncheck ""Work Offline"" if it is checked.    30. Go to the URL: http://check.torproject.org     If you see the text: ""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor"" then you are all set! Your Ubuntu virtual machine is now NOT connected to the    internet in any way. However, you can browse any website using TOR, even Youtube. You do not have to be afraid of javascript or Flash. Any files you save    onto your virtual machine will automatically be saved in the encrypted truecrypt volume you set up earlier. In fact, everything the virtual machine does will    be contained within that truecrypt volume.     Further, even if someone somehow managed to remotely gain full root access to your Ubuntu machine (absurdly unlikely to happen), they would still not be able to    see *anything* about who you are, or what your real IP address is, or even that you are using a Virtual Machine. To them, it would appear that the Ubuntu machine    is your main computer. They would be totally unable to compromise your identity based on this alone.     However, keep the following in mind. If someone were to gain access to your Ubuntu machine, they WOULD be able to see anything you have used it for or any files    you have saved. Therefore, I recommend for the sake of absolute security, do not store anything on your Ubuntu virtual machine that identifies you. This is just    a precaution. It is virtually impossible that someone would manage to remotely gain access to your Ubuntu machine.     === 17. General Daily Usage ===     Much of this guide has involved detailed one-time setup processes. From now on, all you have to do when you want to use TOR from your Ubuntu virtual machine is    to follow these steps. Every step listed is a step you have already done, so feel free to re-visit earlier sections if you need help.     1. Start TrueCrypt, and mount your hidden volume which contains your virtual machine.    2. Start VirtualBox    3. Start TorBrowser Bundle.    4. Click ""Firewall"" to highlight it, and then click on ""Snapshots (1)"" in the top right.    5. Right click on ""Snapshot 1"" and then select ""Restore Snapshot"". Select ""Restore"" if prompted.    6. Right click ""Firewall"" and click ""Start""    7. Right click ""Primary"" and click Start. Log in as normal.    8. Go to ""Applications"" -> ""Accessories"" -> ""Terminal""    9. Type in: sudo bash (and hit enter)    10. Type in your password if prompted.    11. Type in the following commands exactly as shown below (or copy paste them):     ifconfig eth0 10.0.3.2    /etc/init.d/polipo stop    /etc/init.d/tor stop    /etc/init.d/privoxy stop     (Note: the last three commands, those beginning with /etc/ are only necessary if you installed Torchat)     12. Your terminal window should still be open. Type in the following command exactly as shown (or copy paste it):     ssh -N -L 9050:10.0.2.2:9050 root@10.0.3.1     13. Type ""yes"" if prompted. When prompted for the password, give your Firewall password. Not your Ubuntu password.    14. In your terminal window, go to ""File"" and ""Open Tab"".    15. Now, type exactly as shown below to open the second tunnel:     ssh -N -L 8118:10.0.2.2:8118 root@10.0.3.1     16. Return to Firefox. Go to the ""File"" menu and uncheck ""Work Offline"" if it is checked.    17. Go to the URL: http://check.torproject.org     If you see the text: ""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor"" then you are all set!     Enjoy!     Phew, now i have it complete ! I admit its quite extensive, not to say enourmous, but its the best how-to on anonymity and other safety procedures i have found so far. It secures your sys black-hat style^^ :     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hat_Briefings (for those of you who dont know black hat ^^)     You dont have to do all steps at once. You can do a little of it every time you have an hour or two to spare. I think for the whole procedure you will need roughly 8-12 hours. I think its written in a way everybody should be able to follow. If there are still steps unclear just ask, i will see if i can help you.    btw this is written for noobs, but the tips here are interesting for allmost everybody.     P.S.: Once you have installed TOR you can get access to TOR hidden services and other interesting deep-web pages. If you want some links for your first steps into this hidden part of the internet just PM me. If there is a lot of requests i will write an extra thread with the most important websites in the deepweb. One thing before you get started : most deepweb pages arent online 24/7. So if you cant reach a certain website be patient and try again and again till you get access. Another thing : you will find websites that are pretty shocking and disturbing. In 99.5% you will see beforehand what you find on those sites, so if you dont want to see certain things dont klick on the links.     Now that you have a really secure system, you should know what to do when the shit hits the fan and you are arrested or your home gets searched. SYour system, is secured in a way they cant break, so the only thing that can incriminate you now is your testimony.    These 2 youtube videos are 2 lectures on behaviour towards the police in such situations. Part one is done by a criminal defense attorney, part 2 by a very experienced police officer. They both tell you about the tricks the police uses and how you should react :     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08fZQWjDVKE     ;tl,dw : say nothing and ask for a lawyer, ALLWAYS ! You cannot improve your situation with anything you say(this is counterintuitive, but the attorney here has in his whole carrer NEVER heared of single case where a suspect could help his case by talking to the police, but he could name many cases where they made matters way worse) but you can make it a lot worse, so shut the hell up and wait for your lawyer.     Even him being a defense lawyer wouldnt talk to the police under any circumstances. You can tell your story before court AND NEVER, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, BEFORE THAT ! Even the cop in lecture 2 says NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE !!!!!",""

I've been user of Darknet web sites for very long time.Everything was going just perfect, no problems with post service or police and so on...  But unfortunately the day I was always afraid came. 3 days ago I was planning to visit my local post service, cause I was waiting for my product. ( I ordered it from very popular vendor from Evolution)  The address was not mine, but it had my real Name and Surname. So 10 minutes before I was going to visit the post service to get my letter, I got call from Post saying that my letter arrived and I can take it anytime I wish. It was strange for me cause all the time I ever ordered something they never called me..   So I decided to stay safe and wait.. second day I called to the post office and asked that I cant visit them and if it is possible to deliver item at home. they said yes, but no one came..  all this two days I was extremely worrying and finally I found out that hole group of police was waiting me to the Post service.  So of course I decided to never visit Post service. 3 days passed since that and no one bothered me. Im going to work all day and enjoying weekends. Cant tell u that police pays attention to me outside.   So my question is: 1. Should I feel safe? If I wont take that letter do they have any argument against me?  2. I think that I wont be able to order something on my own Name, So is it safe to order something on my friends name?",""

The WSJ said they even have the capability to crack Google and Apple security measures. if you believe they don't actually grab the conversations then you probably still believe in the tooth fairy too. the point is that 3g and 4g dongles are running all their traffic on top of the cell phone network. now TOR and other technologies like SSL (HTTPS) offer encryption, the potential for matching say carding activity to a specific dongle based on time and duration alone, encryption not withstanding, is a huge risk, imho. it is my understanding that most people that are carding have to pop out on clearweb in order to access the site they want to card. just using these dongles in the first place introduces a risk, why not just use your burner phone and call the card order in? But when you throw in the random use of these Stingrays, 1000s of people who aren't even targets may be caught up. you may have the perfect setup and it can be compromised by one of these things. anybody that uses a dongle to get access to the wire is living dangerously. wifi is dangerous too, but that's a different rant.",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","32791","2014-11-19T01:40:40","Re: 3g & 4g dongles","Security & Anonymity","here is an interesting update, from a Baltimore court case. it says homeland security is giving local police grants to buy stingrays, on the condition that it is non-disclosed. interesting i thought is that they used it to locate a specific cell phone and once they found it they raided the house and found a gun. so regardless of what other security features are in use, anon SIM notwithstanding, i find this technology and the trend it is taking very disturbing. Hopefully Justice Scalia will stick to his distorted logic and rule in favor of the 4th admendment prohibition of searches without a warrant. the article also points out that since the prosecution withdrew the evidence, the capabilities of the device might exceed what is publicly known. here is the article:      In a Baltimore trial courtroom on Monday, a local judge threatened to hold a police detective in contempt of court for refusing to disclose how police located a 16-year-old robbery suspectâs phone. Once the Baltimore Police were able to locate Shemar Taylorâs phone, they then searched his house and found a gun as well. But rather than disclose the possible use of a stingray, also known as a cell site simulator, Detective John L. Haley cited a non-disclosure agreement, likely with the Harris Corporation, since the company is one of the dominant manufacturers of such devices. Stingrays can be used to determine a phoneâs location, and they can also intercept calls and text messages. Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry G. Williams retorted, ""You don't have a nondisclosure agreement with the court,"" according to the Baltimore Sun. The prosecution then withdrew the evidence of the phone and gun but said it would still pursue the case. Neither Assistant State's Attorney Patrick R. Seidel nor defense attorney Joshua Insley immediately responded to Arsâ request for comment. Angelita Plemmer Williams, a spokeswoman for the State of Maryland Judiciary, told Ars that Judge Williams was prohibited under court rules from speaking to the press âon pending cases that may still be appealed.â According to the Sun, Haley also told the court that the Baltimore Police was not using a stingray, but Insley âstill believes that police used a stingray to find Taylor.â Relatively little is known about how stingrays are used by law enforcement agencies nationwide, although documents have surfaced showing how they have been purchased and used in some limited instances. Last year, Ars reported on leaked documents showing the existence of a body-worn stingray. In 2010, Kristin Paget famously demonstrated a homemade device built for just $1,500. In recent months, some new information has trickled out as the result of public records lawsuits in various jurisdictionsâparticularly Florida. In September 2014, new documents released by the City of Oakland, California revealed that it is one of a handful of American jurisdictions attempting to upgrade an existing cellular surveillance system. Harris Corporation, makers of the StingRay and other related devices, has traditionally refused to speak with Ars about its products. ""We do not comment on solutions we may or may not provide to classified Department of Defense or law enforcement agencies,"" Jim Burke, a spokesman for Harris, previously said. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union found that at least in Florida, law enforcement had signed similar agreements with the Harris Corporation. Worse still, cops were actively lying to courts about their useâasking a judge to sign off on a âpen register/trap and traceâ order, which is far less invasive than a stingray. Due to some recent reporting in Tacoma, Washington, judges in Pierce County are now requiring that law enforcement seek specific permission when requesting to use a stingray as of this week. UPDATE 2:45pm CT: Hanni Fakhoury, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and former federal public defender, told Ars that judge's typically do not like such evasive action by witnesses. ""It's also a remarkable bit of chutzpah for the officer to refuse to answer the questions when sworn under oath in a proceeding,"" he wrote by e-mail. ""[The detective] may have been following orders but its ridiculous that superiors, whether police or prosecutors, direct officers to evade answering questions about surveillance technology that is now widely known about. Its even more remarkable the prosecutors simply chose to not use the evidence rather that disclose details about it. That says a few things: first maybe we donât really need the surveillance if the government can prove a criminal case without the evidence they gather from it (though that remains to be seen in this specific case). Second, that the technology must really be capable of some remarkable things if the government is so desperate to keep it under wraps."" Brian Owsley, a former federal judge and current law professor at Indiana Tech, told Ars he was not aware of another instance of any law enforcement using a non-disclosure agreement ""as a shield."" ""It is common knowledge that state and local law enforcement agencies are purchasing this technology with grants from the Department of Homeland Security,"" he wrote. ""In exchange for the grants, the agencies must sign the nondisclosure agreement. As courts delve into these Fourth Amendment issues more, there will be more confrontations between the Constitution and the agenciesâ obligations pursuant to the agreements. One significant remedy is that prosecutors may lose evidence because judges suppress it due to the lack of a search warrant""",""

It did mention having encryption on your phone did not prevent the these attacks, which is true because stingrays do not need to crack it in order to intercept voice/sms/data. It just forces your phone to switch from 3g/4g to 2g.(or at least on GSM networks) Then makes your phone connect to them. Since 2g uses A5/1(very weak encryption) for call encryption, your information can easily be cracked and captured by stingrays. Some android devices allow you to disable 2g, but this only disables the 2g data portion of it. Your phone calls and other identifying information will still switch over to 2g when your carrier forces you to or when the stingray jams 3g/4g in an area. It does not seem possible to completely disable 2g on phones. But turning airplane mode on or turning off your phone would stop the attack. T-Mobile have been slowly upgrading their network to use only A5/3 (stronger call encryption). This includes their 2g network as well, which would possibly make their network less prone to these interceptions. Most carrier will discontinue 2g within the next 4-5 years. LE of course does not like this and are currently funding Harris to upgrade their stingrays to be compatible with the 4g lte networks. Other things to be noted is that some 3g networks can still be used to identify users. Some of these LE devices can clone sim cards in order to intercept phones calls even and phones on CDMA networks can be intercepted with fake femtocells.   As for 3g/4g dongles, I know LE can make the carriers remotely modify them to connect to rouge basestations controlled by LE. Methods like that are usually used to only locate you. But in those situations LE would have to know who you are first and if they know who you are, you already lost.

The WSJ said they even have the capability to crack Google and Apple security measures. if you believe they don't actually grab the conversations then you probably still believe in the tooth fairy too. the point is that 3g and 4g dongles are running all their traffic on top of the cell phone network. now TOR and other technologies like SSL (HTTPS) offer encryption, the potential for matching say carding activity to a specific dongle based on time and duration alone, encryption not withstanding, is a huge risk, imho. it is my understanding that most people that are carding have to pop out on clearweb in order to access the site they want to card. just using these dongles in the first place introduces a risk, why not just use your burner phone and call the card order in? But when you throw in the random use of these Stingrays, 1000s of people who aren't even targets may be caught up. you may have the perfect setup and it can be compromised by one of these things. anybody that uses a dongle to get access to the wire is living dangerously. wifi is dangerous too, but that's a different rant."

"Evolution Forums","nightfal","32791","2014-11-20T05:16:38","Re: 3g & 4g dongles","Security & Anonymity","the way carrier devices (ie dongles, cell phones, ect) authenticate to their cell-phone towers is very interesting. The tower doesn't authenticate to the cell phone, at all. However the cell phone needs to authenticate to the tower. This puts all cell-towers in a ""trusted"" position, when they shouldn't be. Its not very hard to build a IMSI catcher (fake cell phone tower) and capture the phone's authentication to the tower. If you set up a rouge cell tower (IMSI catcher/ FBI carrier interception device) you only need to capture the initial authentication from the victim phones/dongle to the rouge cell tower. After you capture the authentication its not hard to clone the device and thus own it.However data transmissions are very different from voice but still suffer from the same underlying vulnerability. Most importantly, the tower itself decides whether to encrypt the data or not. Its all up to the tower if the data is sent encrypted. If the tower disallows encryption your communication to the tower wont be encrypted and you'll never know. Thats why end-to-end encryption (PGP) is great

Some have been found to encrypt to a poor standard whilst others not so. If you are relying on a site to do your encrypting and decrypting then you are putting the responsibility of one of the most important aspects of DNM's down to a script that could fuck up or be exploited and modified. Probably best sticking to recognized PGP software standards for encrypting and decrypting and do it offline, far too much risk allowing anything automated and out of your control to do it for you. You don't know what the outcome will be and whether it's effective. The cloud is a great idea in some many ways but also a heaven for LE to grab everything whilst it's there right in front of them. If you are offline encrypting and decrypting, even on an offline computer that's never been connected to the internet then it's down to the abilities of the PGP software you are using and if you use a recognized PGP software then you'll get a good standard of protection and effectiveness.

Yes windows is a very easily exploitable os but that goes on how you're securing your system. Key is to minimize attack surface. For example, if you use just as a host to host vm's u should be good ( correct me if im wrong). Thanx pablo, Im still kinda sketchy about using outdated encryption but if it's all thats available then it's kool, just have to use other security. I mainly wanna just hide sum files,guides, and shit.

It sounds like Mercedes Benz stops producing cars and recommending Lada (russian company) as a safe alternative. I think this ""recommendation"" was a hidden message to the users. Something like:""What we're saying now is plain wrong. TC is NOT unsafe and BitLocker is NOT an alternative.""."

Depends on what your version of bad implementation is , i mean if you choose FDE with true crypt 7.1A with wipe mode set at 7+ with say AES and you disable hib and all that bullshit and you have a strong pass phrase then you can't go far wrong, make a double container with 2 separate passwords using 2 separate modes of encryption  i highly doubt LE use evil maid attacks  another tip is on the pre boot auth screen with FDE set it too something along the lines of (RANSOM LOCKER) (TORLOCKER VIRUS) something so that you can throw off the investigation by stating your machine has a extreme virus that has taken over and that you are unable to access it",""

The only reason people were ""warned"" off it was because the dev team shut down and made a dramatic exit. TrueCrypt was almost finished with an independent code audit at that time, and zero issues were found.I would trust TrueCrypt waaaaay over Bitlocker. Microsoft's Bitlocker is not secure (notwithstanding TPM being just generally a pain in the ass... keep paper copies of the key around? wtf).   Bitlocker is made to accommodate escrow keys, i.e. ""master"" keys that can unlock bitlocker-encrypted drives. I use this in the enterprise and so do many other sysadmins who work for large companies. It doesn't matter if the employee changed their password or forgot it; you can use the escrow key to get in at any time.;Since Microsoft has been working with the NSA since Windows 95 (search for ""NSA_KEY"" if you want the history of that), the odds are that the Feds have a backdoor entry into any Microsoft encryption product.However TrueCrypt has never been hacked and its algorithms are top-notch. I would choose Serpent over AES or Rijndael. but they're all pretty good. Serpent, btw, is Bruce Schneier's baby, and it is indeed the most secure of all the AES-candidates.;Remember too that your encryption is only as good as your password. Use a passphrase, not a passWORD. See this cartoon which explains what a passphrase is, and why it's a cubic fuckton better than a weird ass password.... (clearnet link:  https://xkcd.com/936  )And if you don't know Bruce Schneier then slap yourself a couple times then visit his blog.  (clearnet link: https://www.schneier.com ). This guy is one of the veteran heavyweights for security and cryptography."

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","31233","2014-11-13T13:48:55","Re: What encryption is everyone using now?","Security & Anonymity","That's because Windows is mainstream, it's in the public domain. No-one is educated willingly on encryption or even basic internet/system security. Here in a world where everyone has Android smartphones that can be bugged and controlled with a click of a button. There are people everywhere still using GPS when they connect to Facebook and relaying your location. People still using awful browsing habits, not using VPN or SOCKS5... You ask most people who go into a computer store what TC is or even encryption and they'd say it's some space-age technology or some shit. People are dumb, mainstream society are puppets. If they got an email from their government asking to copy and send EVERY single document of identity they had, they'd gladly do it. When in reality, what government emails you to request your identity in that way? The only thing we need to do, or the internet has a whole needs to do is educate mainstream society, it's us guys, or the guys on Tor that have got the seed for growth and realization and the truth planted in their minds and with time hopefully that will grow but it's people out there that don't have a fucking clue and don't know where to start that need to learn. Our computer systems are part of our lives, and unless you're deep underground on the internet then the chances are, a good 60-70% of members on Evo will be using Windows. It's the norm, it's basic psychology. You get used to using something, it becomes reliable (to an extent) and you sit there within your own bubble thinking it's never going to pop. That's why people still use Windows because A) they don't know any better or B) they don't believe they have to change their OS. Suppose you could call it ignorance really.","quietForest wrote:It boggles my mind to no end that people with an interest in privacy and security, as well as DNM activity, still use Windows."

If you pay for such a service, at least in a way that identifies you such as by credit card, then assume that the provider will rat you to LE when asked. But even if you use a free proxy, the proxy provider knows your IP address.

The finding, discovered amongst an archive of material supplied by Edward Snowden, reveals that the NSA intercepted thousands of emails sent between companies in a bid to identify security weaknesses in cellphone technology. Further documents reveal that the NSA has been working with that information to covertly introduce new flaws into communication systems, precisely so that they can be tapped in the future. The obvious concern there is that purposefully introducing backdoors not only allows the NSA to snoop on whoever it chooses, but also makes those same people vulnerable to attacks by criminal hackers, too. Karsten Nohl, a security researcher, hammers that point home to The Intercept:     ""Even if you love the NSA and you say you have nothing to hide, you should be against a policy that introduces security vulnerabilities, because once NSA introduces a weakness, a vulnerability, it's not only the NSA that can exploit it."" The GSM Associationâbased in the UK but working with the likes of Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, and Ciscoâis named in the report as one of the more high-profile victims of the email surveillance. But the result of the work are wide-reaching, and one map, shown below, reveals to what degree the NSA has its tentacles in the mobile networks of international territories. Clearly, it has reach in virtually every country in the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and Franceâwho would presumably count themselves as allies.   All told, the report makes for grimâif increasingly predictableâreading, describing new insights into what increasingly feels to be the pervasive surveillance norm. Go read it in full.

In the US the cops will go after buyers but they'd much rather get their hands on a dealer. It makes them look like they're wasting taxpayer resource less if they can say they took 25,000 street value marijuana (sold in nickle bags) off the street and away from 11 year old kids rather than going after some poor schmuck who bought an eight off the DM. If I were a vendor I would not touch anything Windows or Mac with a ten foot pole. I know you said you are using tails but you should really learn how to use Linux. Even an easy distro like Ubuntu or Mint would be 100 times better for security. The only reason to use windows is because you play games.

It never came that day or today instead, it got marked as ""Delivery status not updated"" 14 hours after it was listed as was out for delivery, which from what I understand is automatic if the package wasn't scanned again.

"Evolution Forums","hdmi","35980","2014-12-05T02:21:23","Re: Delivery status not updated USPS","Security & Anonymity","The way I look at it is like this personally, If I know the package is leaving the next day, if it isn't scanned by 12pm I know its gone [This is for my area]. Sometimes even earlier to be honest, although I give it until 12. There should be no reason why it didnt go out unless there was some kind of storm or some kind of serious event that I am aware of including everyone else. This is my personal opinion. However, my exception is this [It works for me because I know my mail men for many years in all my drop locations], if he has the package even after It didn't pass my first expectation I'll still take it. I can tell if something is up since I know them for so long. Use what you know to make a decision. If you think its not worth it and you can afford to lose the money then do that instead of taking the risk of getting caught. Hope I helped in some way.

They can also follow you from the post office. I'm pretty sure some places are lazy to send notices that a package was confiscated even though they should. Its a hard game to play since they are unpredictable. However yeah, as I said I'd still go get it if you don't get a weird feeling about it. Best of luck to ya!

Boxes","Security & Anonymity","As a general rule it is best to avoid them for a number of reasons 1) opening up in your own name doesn't provide any security so you would have to use a fake id. Using a fake id in a federal building is generally not a good idea. 2) unless you are in a rural location there are cameras everywhere recording you picking up your packages. So even if you did succeed in using a fake id now they have you receiving goods and using fake id3) no easier way to do a controlled delivery then to make you come to the window to pick up your packages where you will again be on camera and likely time stamped when they scan the package making it easier to Id you4) it would probably also be suspicious if all you got at your po box were small packages from time to time in the absence of any real mail.  Better off getting a box at a ups store or similar where they still ask for Id but just make copies and don't scrutinize but some of the risks (cameras) still apply. Look into reshippers, offices that offer mail service, good ole neighborhood drops or if you are getting small, non-regular quantities just have it sent right to your house which is prob the lowest risk believe it or not.",""

Well today, I will be writing about how to fix them. So, first of all: What is a DNS ? A DNS or domain name system is used to convert domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a URL into your browser, your computer contacts the DNS and requests for the IP address. What is a DNS leak ? The explanation of a DNS leak is very simple. Let's say you paid for your VPN, set up everything correctly, connect to your VPN, and you are ready to browse the internet anonymously.You go to whatismyipaddress.com or any other IP checking websites, and you find that you were successfully connected to your VPN and it says that you are located in Hong Kong or Netherlands or whatever country your VPN is located in.But what you do NOT know is that your computer is still requesting the IP address of websites from your original DNS (ISP-assigned DNS) instead of your VPN's DNS. How do I check for DNS leaks ? You can do so by going to dnsleaktest.comIf you notice your country flag after the test has been completed, you should know that you have a problem. How to fix DNS leaks ? There are softwares out there for this, but it's preferable if you do everything manually (paranoia). What we will be doing here is very simple. You will be assigning a STATIC IP to your computer instead of DHCP (default). Once that is done, you will be manually assigning your ISP-assigned DNS to your computer, connect to your VPN, remove the DNS, hence forcing your computer to use your VPN's DNS. Assuming that you have a router, login to your router page, go to network status. You will find both of your ISP-assigned DNS's there. Copy and paste that someplace.If you do NOT find them, call your ISP and ask them. Open up command prompt (cmd), type ipconfig /allYou will notice a bunch of numbers.Write down the IPv4 address, Subnet Mask and Default Gateway. Once done, go to Network Connections on your PC, right click on your connection and click Properties.Click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click Properties once again.Check the ""Use the following IP address"" and enter the following: IP Address: Choose one for yourself, but make sure it's within the range. For example, if your IPv4 address (cmd -> ipconfig /all) is 192.168.1.2, you can enter 192.168.1.20.Subnet Mask: Enter the subnet mask that you have copied from ""ipconfig /all""Default Gateway: Enter the default gateway that you have copied from ""ipconfig /all"" Once done, enter the DNS's that you have copied from your router's page into the Preferred DNS Server and Alternative DNS Server respectively. Click OK, and connect to your VPN. Once connected to your VPN, right click on your connection again, click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click Properties once again.Now, remove BOTH of the DNS servers. Once done, open up command prompt (cmd), and enter ""ipconfig /flushdns"" And this is it. Head to dnsleaktest.com and you'll notice that you will be using your VPN's DNS server. If you are NOT connected to your VPN, you will NOT be able to open webpages, because there aren't ANY DNS Servers assigned to your computer. If you want to use the internet without your VPN, here's what you need to do: Go to Network Connections on your PC, right click on your connection and click Properties.Click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click Properties.Check the ""Obtain an IP address automatically"" and ""Use the following DNS server addresses"".   Note that this was a written very quickly, and I was using Windows.

Tails is okay, it has cool features - because it runs on a RANdisk and prides itself on leaving no forensic traces on the host (everything runs in RAM) it wipes the RAM on exit. one downside to tails is that you have to boot into it, so you are constrained by its limits.",""

In most cases, this is completely unnecessary, because why does the destination (an onion based website) care whether or not your using tor? You HAVE to be using tor in order to connect to their website anyways! The best configuration in most cases involving simply a VPN and TOR is VPN > TOR so that your ISP doesn't know your using TOR. There is still no 100% way to be anonymous because as said before, the security game is an endless one. I would definitely recommend checking out whonix's website and all their wiki. It will teach you a LOT about anonymity, and it will also teach you what we currently know, and some of what we're currently unaware of.   I'm still a little confused on this.

OK, some Law 101 here. A burden of proof is required only when you're dealing with a charge in a courtroom. A burden of proof is absolutely NOT required for the purposes of investigation or arrest. The standard for that is a ""reasonable suspicion"". The bar for that has been set so low in the USA that using TOR can easily count for grounds of reasonable suspicion - especially when your excuse is that you're investigating shady Internet drug people. Also, you should know that the suspicion doesn't have to be specifically against you. A cop can investigate everyone in a designated area of suspicion. For example, ""I believe someone in that house is selling drugs"" is more than enough grounds to open an investigation on everyone in it. ""I think there might be a guy with a bomb in that football stadium"" is more than enough grounds to not only stop, but search, temporarily detain and/or investigate everyone that happens to be in that stadium at the time. So basically, for all practical purposes: the police can investigate whoever they want, for whatever they want, at any time. Let's just take this real-life tidbit re: the SR2 bust as an example of how your ""proof"" is not needed to fuck you. Defcon was at a hotel. He was accessing SR2 from the hotel. He was also Tweeting from the hotel. These are from the bust notes. So: this implies that the following sequence occurred: - the police tracked the IP back to the hotel- the police then ran a full investigative probe on EVERY SINGLE PERSON who happened to be in that hotel, including a social media search/XKEYSCORE lookup- the results allowed them to hone in on Defcon's identity So, several hundred people had their entire lives intimately probed - because they happened to check into the same hotel as a guy the Feds were interested in. Note the complete absence of the requirement of any kind of proof here. The authorities do NOT have to prove what you're ""doing"" with TOR. They just have to know you're using it, and then focus the investigative Eye of Sauron on you... which will do the rest. To give you an idea of the scope of that Eye in the USA: - all postal mail is scanned front-and-back and the images stored centrally- all phone text and voice data is scanned and retained for many months- all unencrypted Internet data is also scanned and retained by systems such as XKEYSCORE- police have access to many cameras in cities, on roads, and in buildings- there are many zero-day hacks and attacks (including MiTM attacks on things like Windows Updates downloads) which means the Feds can drop a surveillance bug on your PC at any given time. This is actually a commercial product called FinFisher. So if the Eye turns your way, it's just a matter of time. If they want you, they CAN get you. The only way to be safe is to not have a phone, not use the Internet, not order drugs by mail, and not go outside ever. If you break any of the above, it's likely they can get enough probable cause to pull you in should they wish. Also note that the NSA is on record as confirming that searching for TOR using a web search, or visiting the TOR website, immediately puts a flag on you in XKEYSCORE.

BESIDES, when did I say it couldn't be prosecuted without proof? I was speaking in the IT sense, not legally. Even while they can do without proof, it doesn't change the fact that TOR HIDES THE SITES YOU USE THEREIN! Proof or not, it doesn't change the specs of the software.

And in terms of personal use, i think the weight is at 4g? anything more and they can class you for dealing however that's mainly if caught in the street. The charge for doing what you're doing is drug trafficking however they find this very hard to prove so the chances of them even bothering to investigate 1g is very, very low.  Canadian weed is the best i've experienced.. and think, if packages did get seized so often why would people continue to order? Its a well thought out procedure from the vendors and they do everything by the book with minimal mistakes.  If i were you i'd start of with a small, international delivery and go from there. That will help stop your worries. Go for someone with a great rep (Topshelf420) as he deals with hundreds of orders daily. And remember, there isnt going to be ridiculous deals on here. If you pay Â£100/oz you're going to get a Â£100/oz quality weed. Good luck!",""

Each scenario is different.2.) Love letters are much more common. Police need to have enough evidence to get a search warrant, and usually them seizing just one package is not enough.3.) There is definitely a lot more risk when ordering internationally. Especially weed. I would never order weed internationally because it's the hardest thing to hide. I recommend trying to stick with domestic cannabis. 4.) The quality can be good but it ultimately depends on the vendor.

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","33004","2014-11-19T02:42:35","Re: What is considered a ""personal"" amount of cannabis to order?","Security & Anonymity","I think you run a HUGE risk importing cannabis internationally, you are effectively drug trafficking and just buying a few ounces here and there go out of the window. As you'll know, drug trafficking is more severe than drug dealing even though in a way they are very similar, only difference is, you break two international laws combined when the transaction is 'completed' even if it's held by customs. Plus you have to realize that if it's good weed, then it's probably going to get found by a sniffer dog. That's where vacuum sealed bags come in, but then again... how can you hide a few ounces of weed and then vacuum seal it without it pulling up red flags? It has to be the hardest drug to import into the country.  And they probably won't really begin the investigation until they have enough evidence to suggest you are actively seeking drugs to import into the country. Remember, you are importing drugs. You're not just meeting up with some dude in a back street and exchanging a backpack or some shit. You are IMPORTING drugs into the country. And depending on how 'active' you are in succeeding with this will depend entirely on what sentence you would get, and obviously it gets more worrying when you're importing stuff like cocaine and MDMA. If you get caught, you're address will be permanently flagged and I can imagine the police will have you reporting to the nearest office to check in every few weeks should you move out and choose a different address. No amount is acceptable. Just because it's a few gram doesn't mean that it's illegal. You have to remember that if you have any amount of cannabis on your person or importing into the country, it's illegal. Thinking that having sent 8g here and there every week or so won't go un-noticed... maybe it won't but it doesn't make it legal. Best off having a cautious realistic outlook on the situation, 8 x 4 = 32. In one month you'd of imported more than an ounce. Say, if you did that over a year? 8 x 12 = 416g which is 14oz last time I knew about it. Although you can plead it was personal, they will have recorded you imported a total of 14oz into the country which they can then say very easily that you intended to sell. Just put it into perspective. Not that you won't get away with it. Hey, you might be able to get away with a kilogram even but it all depends on the vendor and how it's shipped. Competence really. No-one is going to foot the charges though at the end of the day if you were to get caught. And it very much illegal whether it's a few gram or a few kilogram. I'd consider using drop addresses if you are to import. Make sure your security is tight, always use PGP encryption and if the vendor doesn't reply in PGP then don't complete an order with him. Simple really. Find addresses you know are safe to send to and that you can get access too.  Or just stick to domestic, surely you can find a reliable vendor in your country that could very easily send you large amounts with very little risk as there isn't the same search restrictions with domestic post as there is with items entering a country. The war on drugs is very much at the borders as apposed to on the streets, they'd rather catch the big guys trying to send in kilograms of cocaine stuffed secretly round the frame of a fake antique masterpiece painting. But then again, if they find drugs then they find drugs - regardless of the amount, it's still recorded and will be reported to the necessary authorities. Just some thought for you there.",""

This court case in Oregon USA is about Diane Roark, the former NSA oversight committee member turned NSA whistleblower, who is currently suing the United States Government. She was raided at her home by the FBI along with similar raids and punishments of people she was connected to, including J.K. Wieb, William Binney, Ed Loomis, Thomas Drake. Diane Roark, NSA whistleblower, seems to be on the side of privacy and anti-mass surveillance. Martin R. Peck, software engineer, has created this BigSun automated redaction system, which he has offered to provide to the NSA. BigSun - NLP system for SIGINT and FOUO semantic analysis - http://sunshineeevvocqr.onion A sample input of text for Martin Peck's NLP auto redaction system offered to the NSA is this.. Quote     dcc2e8c54a747831..c105093fd3adc8c    EGOTISTICALSHALLOT was created in 2014 by Tailored Access Operations as a QUANTUMTHEORY Computer    Network Exploitation component effective against hardened Whoonix Qubes users on the Tor Network.  The affidavit mentions that this sample text was being demonstrated in a fictional redaction example. Some key questions remains for the Whonix and Qubes communities.. Where did this text come from? Did this Martin Peck make this NSA EGOTISTICALSHALLOT exploit codename up himself? Or did he pull it from another existing source? This one sample input of text (dcc2e8c54a747831..c105093fd3adc8c) is just 1 of over 50,000+ sample input texts being used in his current test system. Full sample input text ID lists..http://sunshineeevvocqr.onion/bigsun/corpora/Globalhttp://sunshineeevvocqr.onion/bigsun/raw/69888b283d9dcf92..cec6405ab722661 I searched a handful of his different sample input texts and they largely seem to be from existing actual texts on the internet. One person couldn't generate this many differing sample inputs of text and the text doesn't seem auto generated by a machine. The text about the NSA TAO EGOTISTICALSHALLOT exploit against Whonix Qubes seems written with real NSA knowledge. The all caps EGOTISTICAL prefixed codename matches the other NSA ""EGOTISTICALGIRAFFE"" exploit program that specifically targets Tor users..https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/09/20131004-guard-egotistical_giraffe.pdf A ""shallot"" is a term for some type of onion vegetable, as a reference to Tor..https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallot This exploit of Whonix Qubes claims to be a part of QUANTUMTHEORY Computer Network Exploitation, which would be consistent with the actual NSA QUANTUMTHEORY program..https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/09/20140312-intercept-the_nsa_and_gchqs_quantumtheory_hacking_tactics.pdf""What is QUANTUMTHEORY""""Protocol injection""""Man-on-the-Side"" This text accurately matches up QUANTUMTHEORY with the NSA TAO group (Tailored Access Operations) which often focuses on targeted attacks against end-point machines (0days eccetera).https://www.eff.org/files/2014/01/02/20131230-spiegel-tao_quantum_tasking.pdf""QUANTUMTHEORY can be used only if a TAO Project is set up""""The biggest difference is QUANTUMTHEORY deploys a stage1 implant called VALIDATOR (soon to be COMMONDEER)""https://www.eff.org/files/2014/01/02/20131230-spiegel-tao_quantum_theory.pdf""VALIDATOR is a part of a backdoor access system under the FOXACID project. The VALIDATOR is a client/server-based system that provides unique backdoor access to personal computers"" The mentioned creation date of 2014 also looks accurate as far as matching when the Whonix group started working with the Qubes group to co-develop your software together. Maybe this Martin Peck, software engineer, is just a fan or user of Whonix and Qubes and was being creative by dreaming up this EGOTISTICALSHALLOT exploit? Maybe he copied this text from some other existing source, seemingly like he did with the other 50,000+ sample texts for his BigSun system built for the NSA? It would be good for the Whonix and Qubes people to learn more about the source of this EGOTISTICALSHALLOT project codename mentioned in US Government NSA whistleblower court case document, and if it is ultimately for real, and if so how Whonix and Qubes is currently being compromised. Maybe Diane Roark or Martin Peck could provide the Whonix and Qubes people some clarity on the source of this NSA EGOTISTICALSHALLOT Whonix Qubes exploit reference that has been placed in their court documents and NSA purposed software system? ************************************************************************************",""

"Evolution Forums","mikser677","33392","2014-11-21T06:54:25","It's that time of the year","Security & Anonymity","With first hand knowledge of this work field, remember this time of year the Post Office hires seasonal drivers due to the increase in volume. These drivers generally aren't trained as specific as normal hires do, so expect certain things that you normally may not see with a half way decent usual mailman. Expect later deliveries, all hours of the night, and 2 or maybe even 3 different drivers dropping mail off in a single day at completely different times. Expect possible 'you weren't home when we attempted this' notices online when tracking packages. Attempts you know were never made (most likely due to driver laziness when forgetting the pkg the first time around) Expect the possibility of drivers to not have the entire uniform on (or even not having it on at all) when making a delivery. Lots of times you'll see a guy not even wearing the full uniform, maybe an open USPS jacket over his street clothes. Sometimes not even that. Don't be alarmed, this is most likely due to USPS not providing a fitting uniform to a seasonal employee. Usually by the time their clothes are ordered and arrived, the seasonal driver would have already completed his seasonal obligations. So most of the time they don't even bother ordering them uniforms, especially if they aren't in the 'one size fits all' category. Expect possible mis-deliveries to neighbors. Expect drivers you have never seen before. If you see a new face, who doesn't look familiar or look like he knows what he's doing, chances are he's just a seasonal driver that is inexperienced. Adding to that, don't even be surprised seeing a driver deliver mail just to you, and ride off before delivering anybody else's on that street. Especially Priority and Express mail, as they most likely are assigned to deliver just those types of packages, and you may be the only one on your street receiving one. Don't be surprised to see someone deliver a package at 8pm in the evening in his personal car without a uniform. Most likely is a supervisor or somebody taking action for a non delivery situation caused by a rookie driver. This is actually more common then one may think. I don't think a X-Mas season has gone by since I've used DNM's where this didn't happen at least once. Don't be surprised for drivers to request (or even deny delivery without) a signature on packages that clearly don't require it. This happens. Especially on Express packages even in situations where the Waive Signature box is clearly marked. Some veteran drivers make this mistake on occasion, so it's not impossible by any stretch for a rookie to make the same mistake. All sorts of things like that are more common then you think this time of year. While I absolutely implore to stay safe when ordering, if one of these (or similar) occurs with one of your orders. Try and hopefully ease the paranoia about something sketchy going on in the works with LE, and realize it's very more then likely a rookie driver mistake rather then a setup. I had 3 packages expected to arrive today. Upon my first mailman's arrival, none of them were in my batch of mail. 2 of the 3 were delivered by 2 additional drivers hours apart later in the day, while 1 of them required me to follow up with my tracking number to see the mix up as to why I didn't receive it. They were one Express, One Priority, and One First Class deliveries. All of them were 'delayed' due to simple seasonal driver mistakes, and all of them arrived safely. Just goes to show that when not just 1, but 3 expected deliveries didn't arrive today when they 'should have', there was a simple reason and solution for those instances in the end! Stay safe as always!! Safety is concern number 1. Keeping that in mind, if something seriously doesn't feel right when not receiving a delivery (especially if it's dealer amounts) use your best judgement in how to proceed with that in a case by case basis. Don't assume there is 100% nothing to worry about in a non delivery this time of year, but equally don't 100% assume it's LE coming to get you if such situation arises. Always use your judgement and assess each situation separately. Just remember 99% of the time it's the most simple/harmless answer regarding your problem. With pretty much all those 'problem's' getting solved without the need for you to personally do anything other then to wait!

First: I am no expert or dedicated hacker, i am just a person using common sense and having a bit of a background in programming. Please correct me, if i get something wrong, but please be nice, and support your claims with some source. I think for the purpose of Buying / Vending small to midscale a simple usage of TOR e.g. via Tails / Whonix is not only sufficient but recommended. As far as I understood, when connecting to a hidden service no malicious / compromised exit-node will be able to read your traffic, because it is end to end encrypted between you and the hidden service. So if you plan to vend or buy using a hidden service you are anonymous to the hidden service, and private to the routing, probably compromised, TOR- nodes. Of course it can be that the hidden service is not legit or got seized and is now acting as honeypot / evidence generator for LE. But still you have your anonymity, because the hidden service is not able to know who you are.  In the history they used javascript exploits to unmask the users anonymity as happened with the FH-Busts last year. So again, why should I be using a VPN to connect to TOR, to hide the TOR usage from my ISP? As far as I have understood, anonymity is increased if you blend into the bigger mass - the bigger mass is certainly the whole lot of TOR users compared to a small amount of Users of a certain VPN that go to TOR with it. So again, if i just intend to buy or vend something small to midscale. I think best security is through anonymity, and not some sophisticated / special setup, that could distinguish you from the averege TOR user. Of course I dont question using PGP and secure OS and to not use your home internet connection. Any comments ?  I know this topic is kind of an evergreen, but i have the special case of using just hidden services and not comitting fraud activities on the clearnet here. Thank you in advantage, AZ",""

"Evolution Forums","addguy","21261","2014-08-24T04:33:47","Re: Buying / Vending Security Setup","Security & Anonymity","What we don't want Some users have requested support for VPNs in Tails to ""improve"" Tor's anonymity. You know, more hops must be better, right?. That's just incorrect -- if anything VPNs make the situation worse since they basically introduce either a permanent entry guard (if the VPN is set up before Tor) or a permanent exit node (if the VPN is accessed through Tor). Similarly, we don't want to support VPNs as a replacement for Tor since that provides terrible anonymity and hence isn't compatible with Tails' goal.What we wantTails -> Tor -> VPNUse cases     Access services that block Tor.    Reach a local resource on a VPN that is not accessible in any other way.    Reach a VPN non-anonymously (e.g. your account is tied to you IRL) while only hiding your geo-location, which may be the only thing you need in some situations. (Maybe invalid since this is not part of the PELD spec (yet?) AFAIK.) Solution The easiest way to solve use case 1 (which we feel is the most important one for this Tor/VPN setup) is to use a SSH connection with the DynamicForward option. The newly created SOCKS port can be used to have a fixed outgoing IP address. We could write on how to use that in an ""unsupported, advanced users only, may kill kittens"" part of the documentation. Note that this setup isn't relevant for I2P for the same reason that it's irrelevant for Tor hidden services.Tails -> VPN -> Tor/I2PUse cases     Make it possible to use Tails at airports and other pay-for-use ISPs via iodine (IP-over-DNS).    Access Tor on networks where it's censored.    Some ISPs require their customers to connect to them through VPNs, especially PPTP. Tails is currently unusable for them out of the box. Solution Use cases 1 and 3 are worthwhile to support, and should be rather easy to implement. See ticket #5858. For all other uses of this setup (e.g. 2) we already promote bridges instead. Now that obfsproxy is included, it should cover all our needs.Pages linking to this one: support/faq support/faq.de support/faq.fr support/faq.ptLast edited Tue 25 Feb 2014 01:09:58 PM CET",""

Leaked Snowden files and NSA reports show that they can DE-anonimyze a  good number of TOR users, mostly by owning exit nodes and ""DUMB USERS - EPIC FAIL"" <-- their wording. In theory I fail to see how using an VPN before TOR is wrong, since it adds another step to your anonymity and hides you from your ISP who might report you and from some kind of mass data collecting/tor user unmasking program out there. One has to always keep in mind (even if that might not be the case) that VPN keeps logs and will ggive you up in a heartbeat so security has to be multilayer.

If you do vpn>tor, and something like the CIPAV as seen during 2013, happens, your tor IP isn't covering you, but your VPN is. Now, however, assuming the VPN is within reaching room of feds who want you, they can get the data, and your IP will be in the VPN's logs, assuming there almost undoubtedly are logs being collected. If you use tor, your IP is hidden from the VPN, and so if something like CIPAV happens, they know your VPN provider but they can't prove you've used the VPN at that time."

"Evolution Forums","kittendew","32089","2014-11-14T18:26:35","Re: Spoofing gps location on an iphone","Security & Anonymity","No, and it wouldn't help you any if you DID spoof the GPS, because the only person you'd be fooling is yourself when you go to Google Maps. GPS is for your convenience, not the carrier. The carrier knows at all times where you are, and it's not by GPS. It's by the cellphone signal itself. A fundamental part of cell communication is that each cell tower has to know when you're about to go out of range. This allows the tower to pass the call to the next tower (cell), so your call doesn't drop.  This is why it's called a ""cellular phone"". So: each tower knows how far away you are. It knows this based on your signal strength. A strong signal means you're close. A weak signal means you're far. If you are in range of more than 2 towers (i.e. always) the carrier can precisely determine your location via triangulation. This is really simple maths and the towers not only do this - they also STORE it.  Your cellphone company knows exactly where your phone's been. In fact this method is waaay more reliable and precise than GPS in urban centers or underground. Ever wonder how your Google Maps is so good even when you're in an underground shopping mall, or near huge buildings? GPS is fucked in both those scenarios. The answer is that the Android and Apple phones get this precision by using the same mechanism. (in fact, they use triple measures - GPS, tower strength, AND nearby WiFi SSIDs). In Australia for over 15 years, the cellphone companies used this as a client service. Instead of the carrier logo on the phone (e.g. Vodafone) you'd get the street name you were currently on. Move streets, and the display would change to reflect the new location. This was way before GPS on phones was ever thought of. So don't bother with spoofing GPS unless you like getting yourself lost - you certainly won't be losing the cops.",""

So im gonna use it and create many affiliates, to receive my bonuses from this company (their ID are needed like a proof, when creating account) thats why I need to hide my IP, if they'll discover that im using the same IP for all those affiliates, they'll just block me.

Id like to visite all those accounts that'll be created by me... so I need to go back in same IP (fake one) please help me to do it... im really in need of some help.. i were reading alot about it. but cant find answers to my questions. To be honnest I wanted first to test it and then to see if they'll gonna block me... but the problem is that they'll start to pay only after 90 days of work (clicking on ads etc) and only in 91th day they'll start to investigate if im forthy of paying...  if i were using same  ip etcone of my friends was doing it from same house for his gf account..  and they got both blocked the day they were about to get their payemet. so he done everything for nothing for 90 days !  P.S  ----English is my 3rd language... sorry for faults guys -----Im using tails/tor (and I know how to ExitNodes {GB} etc) -----Im not gonna win lot of money with that.. something around 200 euro month maybe (even with 200+affiliates...) thats why others are not interested Thank you for reading  and for your great help !",""

The WSJ said they even have the capability to crack Google and Apple security measures. if you believe they don't actually grab the conversations then you probably still believe in the tooth fairy too. the point is that 3g and 4g dongles are running all their traffic on top of the cell phone network. now TOR and other technologies like SSL (HTTPS) offer encryption, the potential for matching say carding activity to a specific dongle based on time and duration alone, encryption not withstanding, is a huge risk, imho. it is my understanding that most people that are carding have to pop out on clearweb in order to access the site they want to card. just using these dongles in the first place introduces a risk, why not just use your burner phone and call the card order in? But when you throw in the random use of these Stingrays, 1000s of people who aren't even targets may be caught up. you may have the perfect setup and it can be compromised by one of these things. anybody that uses a dongle to get access to the wire is living dangerously. wifi is dangerous too, but that's a different rant."

I have USB sticks that are encrypted (not by FIPS 420 - which is govt standard) so merely removing them from the USB port will preserve the encryption. also you can have full disk encryption - but that isn't going to solve the RAM issue and your encryption keys are stored in RAM (otherwise you would need to enter password everytime you made a read or write). i am currently working on a security suite that will wipe the RAM contents securely. BTW in order to recover the state of the RAM chips, the analysis has to be done ASAP after the machine is shutdown. so turn off the box at after use. they raid now at 5:00 AM hoping to catch the machine running (unencrypted). that's why they waited until DPR logged on to his laptop in SFO public library before literally taking him down. so far as compromising files go, my security suite already contains a utility that permanently deletes and overwrites completely the space that was occupied by the file. this is good when you copy the file over to your encrypted USB stick (BTW 256 GB sticks are getting cheap) or you want to get rid of PGP decrypted message.  because once you use this routine to delete a file it ain't coming back. it is similar to the shred command in Linux. if anybody is interested in more about this then send me a PM. deleting files permanently is just one piece of the puzzle. windows boxes store crap all over the place, including search histories, and cookies and other potential threats to the point that they have gotten ridiculous. in fact the tactics used these targeting ad companies is insidious and some of their techniques have been incorporated into LE forensic tools. my suite, unlike CCleaner Pro, or a couple of others gives you the option to select what you want to delete rather than using brute force to wipe everything. that brute force technique leaves a big footprint in the OS which is evidence in and of itself. but back to FDE encryption for a second, they had a recent case (i forget where) that said a defendant was required to provide his fingerprint to access his computer without a warrant, but that a warrant was required to compel him to provide his password. there are plenty of precedents where defendants were required to give up things like combinations to safes, and other stuff on the premise that they contained relevant criminal data. so FDE is an iffy proposition at best. i am looking for a solution to be able to brick a hard drive so that it cannot be recovered. it is simple to brick the drive so it can't be used (merely set a power on password that would take 1000 years to recover). but that doesn't get rid of the data - which can still be recovered forensically. until i solve these issues with software - the best solution is to use a burner hardrive. it easy to build a system VM and all (perfectly clean) and make a ghost image of it. then buy another hardrive - for carding and stuff you don't need a 2TB hard drive - a 20 GB will suffice. you can buy them for $20, and just pull the old one after use and drive a couple 16 penny nails through it, install the replacement and ghost the image onto it and in 20 minutes or so you again have a pristine system. no need to worry about trace analysis. it just occurred to me how i can wipe all the memory chips at once. i can design a box type of gizmo that fits over the chips, can even have a fan in it, but has a button on the side of your computer that you push and it activates a strong electromagnet immediately above the chips. this would effectively erase any residual magnetism that they may be holding. it would have its own battery so it could be pushed after shutdown. hope this helps someone.

BTW in order to recover the state of the RAM chips, the analysis has to be done ASAP after the machine is shutdown. so turn off the box at after use. they raid now at 5:00 AM hoping to catch the machine running (unencrypted). that's why they waited until DPR logged on to his laptop in SFO public library before literally taking him down. so far as compromising files go, my security suite already contains a utility that permanently deletes and overwrites completely the space that was occupied by the file. this is good when you copy the file over to your encrypted USB stick (BTW 256 GB sticks are getting cheap) or you want to get rid of PGP decrypted message.  because once you use this routine to delete a file it ain't coming back. it is similar to the shred command in Linux. if anybody is interested in more about this then send me a PM. deleting files permanently is just one piece of the puzzle. windows boxes store crap all over the place, including search histories, and cookies and other potential threats to the point that they have gotten ridiculous. in fact the tactics used these targeting ad companies is insidious and some of their techniques have been incorporated into LE forensic tools. my suite, unlike CCleaner Pro, or a couple of others gives you the option to select what you want to delete rather than using brute force to wipe everything. that brute force technique leaves a big footprint in the OS which is evidence in and of itself. but back to FDE encryption for a second, they had a recent case (i forget where) that said a defendant was required to provide his fingerprint to access his computer without a warrant, but that a warrant was required to compel him to provide his password. there are plenty of precedents where defendants were required to give up things like combinations to safes, and other stuff on the premise that they contained relevant criminal data. so FDE is an iffy proposition at best. i am looking for a solution to be able to brick a hard drive so that it cannot be recovered. it is simple to brick the drive so it can't be used (merely set a power on password that would take 1000 years to recover). but that doesn't get rid of the data - which can still be recovered forensically. until i solve these issues with software - the best solution is to use a burner hardrive. it easy to build a system VM and all (perfectly clean) and make a ghost image of it. then buy another hardrive - for carding and stuff you don't need a 2TB hard drive - a 20 GB will suffice. you can buy them for $20, and just pull the old one after use and drive a couple 16 penny nails through it, install the replacement and ghost the image onto it and in 20 minutes or so you again have a pristine system. no need to worry about trace analysis. it just occurred to me how i can wipe all the memory chips at once. i can design a box type of gizmo that fits over the chips, can even have a fan in it, but has a button on the side of your computer that you push and it activates a strong electromagnet immediately above the chips. this would effectively erase any residual magnetism that they may be holding. it would have its own battery so it could be pushed after shutdown. hope this helps someone."

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","33066","2014-11-22T16:48:37","Re: Wiping Computer","Security & Anonymity","obviously you don't understand how data recovery works. you are assuming that each bit is being replaced by some random process. since bits are either on or off, it kind of silly talking about overwriting them with random values. but following your logic and using bytes as an example - there are 2^8 or 256 possible byte representations using 8 bits with values of 0 or 1. you ar proposing to do a recovery by guessing which bits have been change by the wipe. what you are missing is that the new data might not overwrite the old data, it might be sitting next to it of the drive. in other words you can have multiple data tracks in the same groove, so it is entirely possible to recover data that has only been overwritten once. but with three or more writes there are multiple tracks and the possibility of overlap, etc. 7 times is recommended as the standard for obfuscating data to the point of making it very very difficult to recover. as i mentioned it may still possible to recover data with an electron microscope - but you are talking CIA or other spook stuff. so far as destroying a drive goes, just drive bails through it and then toss it off a big dam. when i worked on nuclear stuff (in the DOS days when hard drive tracks were 100 times wider) we used have to pull all the hard drives and lock em in  a safe at night. when the wanted to destroy them they would make a pile in the parking lot and run over them several times with a large steamroller.","mikser677 wrote:I read somewhere that after rewriting your hdd with all 1 or all 0 single time, there is 50% chance for every bit to be recovered.

"Evolution Forums","quietForest","33596","2014-11-23T05:18:00","Re: Question about setup","Security & Anonymity","That could be done as you're suggesting, but I think maybe it might be worthwhile to learn a little more about Tails before you try to do all that. Tails is based on Debian after all. Normally with Tails one would install to a usb drive, then set up an encrypted (by default) persistant volume where all of your notes, passwords, pgp keys, etc are kept. Its called a persistant volume because everything else is read-only, so any modification that is made only lasts until reboot. This is a security feature and can be used with the encrypted persistance partition too. To do what you're suggesting, the process would be the same but with custom partitioning before anything else, and either installing Debian first then adding its boot info to Tails bootloader, or installing Debian second and adding the Tails info to the Debian bootloader (presuming that Debian is installed with LUKS encryption, similiar to truecrypt). After that you could also encrypt the Tails system partition, but that isn't really necessary and would complicate getting the bootloader info correct. I would still go with two separate usb sticks, though. Its less complicated and more importantly gives a greater degree of separation and control. If you did go ahead with both installations on the same one, even if the Debian and Tails system were encrypted separately, that still leaves Tails /boot partition exposed if the Debian gets compromised somehow (which would potentially compromise both).",""

I knew you'd have a few questions, which would have been happy to answer when you paid me. And yeah I don't have time to help you for free especially off the board at your becking call. Of course I didn't spend 22 hours on this, and could have made a lot more than $50 in the 15 mins. it took. Yeah it takes me a lot to get out of bed. Also you kind of took these pm's out of order. I still like what I said, so no real complaint there. To be fair you had said you updated and then ran:apt- get install proxychains Also said I wasn't gonna spend a lot of time on it spoon feeding, but would try for the price. You said you had programming experience, how was I to know that you didn't know to enter after you type: cd /Which I would have helped if you actually paid me, which I stated. Then you just went on how I should just do this for free and I was crazy to think you would have ever paid you. As much fun as this has been, I got other stuff to do now that I'm done taking a dump. Now you can move on and demand a working method for your next step, and get pissy when its not handed to you. PS The reason you use tails is everything is forced through Tor. Glad you were able look stuff up, cause this is the easy part. Now its a lot of stuff you will have to do on your own as real good working methods arent handed out. Best of luck. Edit: I still like mine better, which can be found on tcf Note from the beginning I told you just to run proxiefer in it in a windows vm on tails, as you'll need to blend in with the herd. Before you persistently asked for a step by step tutorial. At which point I told you I was to busy and you begged and offered to pay. ok, now I'm gonna wipe, have a good day.

In context of Whonix it's not useful and should not be installed and activated by default for everyone. It does not do what you may think, does not magically solve all DNS related security issues, does not implement end-to-end DNS encryption to the destination server. (That conceptually can not work. If you knew the IP of the destination server in advance, you wouldn't require DNS in the first place.) The server will still see all DNS requests in cleartext. This is only a short version for the many reasons, why it should not be activated by default for everyoneMore reasons: Tor is about distributing trust. Tor's DNS server change as circuits change, thus trust is distributed. Circuits are stream isolated (for pre-installed applications) and change every ten minutes. As far as I know, there are only two public open resolvers supporting the protocol: CloudNS and OpenDNS. (There is a free server-side proxy that anybody can use.)Public resolvers supporting DNSCrypt and/or OpenDNS have not given reasons to distrust them yet. Even we trusted the people running DNSCrypt servers, their servers would have to be trusted as well and that's not wise to let DNS security for all Whonix users depend on few servers. It's also about load balancing. If Whonix was to use a DNSCrypt supporting server by default and that server decides to forbid connections from the Tor network (due to the Tor network used to abuse their servers with DDOS or for whatever reasons) or if the servers go down for maintenance, DNS would break for all Whonix users.For even more explanations on DNSCrypt, see forum post one and two related to this topic."

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","32282","2014-11-14T05:32:49","air-gap","Security & Anonymity","below is an article about how USB sticks can be used to compromise air-gapped boxes (or connected boxes=air-gapped network=closed system) as you may or may not know i am big proponent of taking the simple security precaution of taking all pgp encrypted and other downloaded files to an air-gapped box via sneakerware and a USB stick. now i have also pointed out in various posts that windows has disabled auto-run on USB sticks starting with WIN7. the article alludes to this by saying that since closed systems are not connected that they may not have the necessary updates to prevent auto-run from a USB stick. the famous Stuxnet exploit that was executed by the Mossad boys was against Irani closed networks - but they were running XP boxes - which allowed auto run. on my air-gapped box that i use for decryption, etc, i have a block that prevents the USB stick from executing anything. this is partly because i do occasional work for defense attorneys and i have to examine images as seized by the other side. so it is imperative that any connection i make to the drive containing the seized image cannot alter it in any way. and also the USB stick is read-only so data can't go back that way either. i don't have a network - just one box with no NICs and a sandbox. i use it to decrypt PMs and open other downloads like .pdf files. as a programmer i can say with certainty that it is very possible to embed malicious code in a .pdf file. so it only makes sense to NEVER open a file, click on a link, or decrypt a message while you are still logged into TOR (or even on clearweb). everybody has an old box lying around - use it. if you don't have one send me a PM - i have a storage locker of old Dell desktops that have memory and hard drives and MS-OS stickers. these boxes work fine for this task. everybody on here is supposedly worried about security (i sure get enough PMs about it) but they don't take basic steps. security is more than just using TOR or VPN or socks5 proxy. it's a total package, and while it's a pain in the ass to have to walk your msg or file to another box, it is a simple and vital step. if you are interested in the manifestations of what i am talking about read the article below:               Researchers from security firm ESET have analyzed a malicious tool used by a notorious cyber espionage group to steal valuable information from air-gapped networks. Isolating a sensitive computer network from the Internet can be an efficient security measure, but threat actors have found ways to get around it. A group believed to be linked to the Russian government, know as ""Sednit,"" ""APT28"" and ""Sofacy,"" appears to have developed the tools necessary to achieve this task. In a recent report on the attacks launched by APT28 against European governments, militaries and security organizations, FireEye revealed that one of the tools used by the group is a modular family of implants called CHOPSTICK. Researchers identified one variant of CHOPSTICK that defeats closed networks by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives. One such tool used by the threat group was analyzed by ESET. Dubbed Win32/USBStealer, the malware has been used since at least 2005 in campaigns against government organizations in Eastern Europe, researchers said. There are several variants of this threat, but the security firm has focused on analyzing the most sophisticated one. According to ESET, the USBStealer dropper initially infects a computer within the targeted organization that's connected to the Internet (Computer A). The dropper is disguised as a legitimate Russian application called USB Disk Security. The dropper monitors the infected device for removable drives. When a removable drive is detected, the malware is copied onto it, and its Autorun file is modified so that USBStealer is executed when the drive is inserted on a different computer. In this phase, the malware also marks the USB drive as having been used on a machine with an Internet connection. Once the infected drive is connected to an air-gapped computer (Computer B), the malware is transferred onto it. The machine's name is registered on the removable drive, a process which enables the attackers to map the devices they can reach. The attack only works if Autorun is enabled on the targeted computer. The feature was deactivated by Microsoft in 2009 with the release of a Windows update, but experts say the method could still work considering that air-gapped devices are in many cases out of date due to the lack of an Internet connection. When the USB drive is once again connected to Computer A, the malware operator drops a series of data exfiltration commands onto it. These commands will be executed as soon as the drive is connected again to Computer B. The malware is interested in files used by cryptographic applications, and files that appear to be associated with private software. The threat searches for files of interest everywhere on the infected machine, but it avoids folders created by various antiviruses. Once the stolen files are transferred back to Computer A, the attackers need to use a different piece of malware to copy the data to their own servers because USBStealer doesn't have such capabilities, ESET noted. Researchers say it's uncertain how the initial infection occurs, but a likely attack vector is spear phishing. FireEye has identified a spear phishing campaign that uses the USB Disk Security application as a lure. Related: ""AirHopper"" Malware Uses Radio Signals to Steal Data from Isolated Computers       interesting about it's lack of capability to copy the stolen data back - that makes no sense to me because if the owners of the USB stick need to copy data from the USB stick why would it be called malware. seems to me it would just be a program. malware  implies something delivered to a target, not an application you use on your own systems.

I have been tampering with the idea of putting the security that whonix gives you (against exploits that could get in controll of your machine) and having a live system (no saved Data) together. I know that the tails devs are looking to sanbox their browser environment and other stuff. It would be nice if some of the more versed members could give possible solutions on how to implement this, input on the problems I have written down and input towards the general idea is also greatly appreaciated.  Problems coming to mind regarding the implementation of this idea:- Having to build a VM every time you boot tails (at least a script has to be run), which will take time.- Liberte can handle software on persistance, but the last update was in 2012 i think.- I do not have enough knowledge to throw up a custom solution, incase whonix is no option (for example because chaining TOR might be bad). - There is no research on chaining TOR. I would like some input especially on this point.  I also face the question on whether this will really add on security? If yes: Is it worth it? Who could profit from this kind of opsec, for buyers I think it's not too useful in any case, but what about some paranoid vendors that fear an unknown exploit similar to some javascript ones.

If their ISP keeps logs, then it's just as bad as if Mullvad kept their OWN logs, because it's the server keeping logs, regardless of who's doing the recording.

Don't get me wrong, I still use a VPN but only to encrypt my clearnet traffic data. You cannot rely on it for your anonymity. Wifi hopping is still the better option.

Most of these places are, as much as I hate communism, East Baltic and Eurasia, and also Asia. Even if they keep logs, the only people they are jurisdictorily adherent to, is a government which is almost certainly in on the deal, who won't do anything for their own police state, let alone respond to external warrants from Western nations, aka no arrest/seizures. EU and U.S., there's no such thing as ""no-logs.""

"Evolution Forums","Fripouille","38886","2014-12-19T23:26:18","Re: Possible upcoming attempts to disable the Tor network!!","Security & Anonymity","","Possible upcoming attempts to disable the Tor networkPosted December 19th, 2014 by armaThe Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized servers in the network called directory authorities. (Directory authorities help Tor clients learn the list of relays that make up the Tor network.) We are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use.We hope that this attack doesn't occur; Tor is used by many good people. If the network is affected, we will immediately inform users via this blog and our Twitter feed @TorProject, along with more information if we become aware of any related risks to Tor users.The Tor network provides a safe haven from surveillance, censorship, and computer network exploitation for millions of people who live in repressive regimes, including human rights activists in countries such as Iran, Syria, and Russia. People use the Tor network every day to conduct their daily business without fear that their online activities and speech (Facebook posts, email, Twitter feeds) will be tracked and used against them later. Millions more also use the Tor network at their local internet cafe to stay safe for ordinary web browsing.Tor is also used by banks, diplomatic officials, members of law enforcement, bloggers, and many others. Attempts to disable the Tor network would interfere with all of these users, not just ones disliked by the attacker.Every person has the right to privacy. This right is a foundation of a democratic society. For example, if Members of the British Parliament or US Congress cannot share ideas and opinions free of government spying, then they cannot remain independent from other branches of government. If journalists are unable to keep their sources confidential, then the ability of the press to check the power of the government is compromised. If human rights workers can't report evidence of possible crimes against humanity, it is impossible for other bodies to examine this evidence and to react. In the service of justice, we believe that the answer is to open up communication lines for everyone, securely and anonymously.The Tor network provides online anonymity and privacy that allow freedom for everyone. Like freedom of speech, online privacy is a right for all.;On December 19th, 2014 arma said:To be sure to keep our source safe, we're not providing more details quite yet.But actually, we don't know many more details than the ones we posted. And as for your 'why', that's an excellent question, and one we've been wrestling with too. There are nine directory authorities, spread around the US and Europe. If they're trying to hunt down particular Tor users, most possible attacks on directory authorities would be unproductive, since those relays don't know anything about what particular Tor users are doing.Our previous plan had been to sit tight and hope nothing happens. Then we realized that was a silly plan when we could do this one instead"

Well in my case the perpose is to visit bank sites as well as paypal and banks(secure sites), im not going in to details but what i know is that they check yous OS, keyboard language, time,location, mac adress, hdd serial, computer ID. and to my knowlege windows is best because it doesnt raise any flags because its most common one to use and VM is identifyable so it wont do i guess.  Basically the chain is Windows>4g stick(anon)>vpn>socks>mazilla>internet.  3)VERACRYPT>TRUECRYPTEverybody saw that message they posted on the truecrypt website thats its not safe to use no more, also that some one tryed to decrypt that message and it meant that NSA is over the controll of it now, more about it here: CLEARNET (https://www.livebusinesschat.com/smf/index.php?topic=5629.0 )some people say that 7.1a is still safe to use but i decided to go with Veracrypt it is more secure and has same interface. 4)4G STICKIts a wireless hot spot with 4g/lte offered at tmobile for $50/month for 5gb of data, of cource refillable. no traces to you and can use anywhre(where is good service). I also figure i could use a wifi extender and carefully plant my 4g stick somewhere where there is good signal, and just kick it half mile away somewhere with my laptop and pina colada:) Or just connect to any public wifi and again i dont have to be near it since a 1000mw wifi antenna can reach up to a mile and costs $77. 5)VPNMullvad vpn is my choise as its simple to use, has dns leak protection, blocks internet if connection fails and accepts bitcoin and pretty cheap $6.50/month. Maybe anybody has specific setting for this one or its just good the way it came? 6)BROWSERMazilla seems to be a carders choise, i dont know why it is better that opera, tor or chrome browser so if anybody can explain, if so what version and what setting inbrowser should be set? should i enter any setting of vpn or vip72 client or proxifier into the browser? 7)PROTECTIONANTIVIRUS: After searching for best antivirus everything led to webroot secure anywhere antivirus and kaspersky. Its free because reg keyes can be found online pretty easy!MALWARE: Malwarebytes get the first place here in many people opinions so one of the steps to protectiong your computer. Also free!FIREWALL: Comodo Firewall Free and ZoneAlarm Free. Those are good by statesmans choise. I respect that and dont mind using all those protections.If anybody has anything to add to this, if you think something is not necessary or some software is better please let me know! Also all those need to be set up correctly because simply filling computer with bunch of shit is not gonna do, it has to work together and im not geek to know all that so suggestion on how to set em up or maybe a different sofware is a knowlege that i would like to know so please share! 8)Spoofing, faking computer to not link back to youSo i know that well secured sites that deal with money know stuff about our computer such as: time, language, mac, Hdd serial, computer ID and location.Time, language and computer ID can be dealt with. To change Change computer ID (for win 7) click start -> right click computer -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Computer Name -> change button -> type in the column âcomputer name âto give new computer ID name. and restart computer.Mac adress can be changed with TMAC software which is free. Hdd serial is only changeble on 32bit systems and the software for that is PBDownForce. As stated in statesman guide it says you can change it with xboxharddrive software but it only changed a volume id not the hdd serial nmber(and its not even possible to change serial, it only spoofs it untill next restart) And even then i know cases when guy would get banned from gaming league and no software would help, and it was back in 2011, so they somehow can ditect your hdd no matter how but i think it depends on a site also, i think those big guys know whats up. So if anybody can suggest a solution on what to do about hdd serial it would be appriciated. I also saw some software that can simply hide your hdd serial: (Object tree)  and etc but its for windows xp only and i dont know if its safe to use when visiting sites like papal, macys, paydayloans etc..Also heard of chameleon, but cant find cracked version of it and it costs $70 and they were supposed to release 64 bit version but site seems to be dead. Does VM help changing HDD serial?  Maybe its smart to change to XP since the programm PBDownforce is capable with it but then again i have doubts that it will work after explained situation.As for location, I have vpn and socks to get where ever i want.  9)Filemind quick fix, CCleaner, Bleachbit. All those are to are to clean evidence: cookies, cache, metadata, private info, gps info, browsing history, any trace!As long as i know each one does something that others cant do, so its good to have 3 of them. AGAIN, how do you properly set them up. and what is the order on how to run them? Before? After? During? or maybe you dont even need to run them, if so give an example on when not to clean it? how to properly connect them to the browsers and to system files?i know couple methods on how to manually clean it, with statesmans guide:In CMD: Ipconfig /release (Press enter) 2. Ipconfig /renew (Press enter) 3. Ipconfig /flushdns (Press enter)These can be located and manually deleted from the following directories: â¢ Windows: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Macromedia\Flash Player\ #SharedObjects.Is it necessary to manually clean if i have all that software? 10)SOCKSSo far the most hardest things i had to learn! has many different aspects and warnings of what to do and what not to do. Vip72 has best reviews and most popular one. I have downloaded their client and their proxifier. it all seems to work great and i managed to launch everything and get it to work the first time without knowlage, but i saw sooo many people having trouble with it so it gives me doubt that it cant be that easy. Also i tryed using proxifier downloaded from independent site but i couldnt get vip72 and that independent proxifier to work, it only worked with its own that came in the same download. If anyone can share their setting in proxifier and vip72 that need to be manually set it will be much appriciated. Also what is the best sites to check for DNS leaks, banned/blocked IP and geo? CONCLUSIONIn conclusion i wanna say that i hope i did my homework and searched as much as i can. I will be greatful to hear your guys`s opinion on this and any advice. Let this be a help for others too. And of course i could suggest tips like: never carry cell phone with you when you do scetchy shit, even if its off. dont show your face, wear glasses and hoodie, get yourself some decent backpack to hold all your stuff and portable charger for your devices and always use pidgin+otr. Get yourseld TCF membership and just browse on your free time, education never stops and there are people that can help and if you know something that other people dont, dont hazitate to share too. It all comes around!    Date of writing this is 11/5/2014.   Thank you all for reading and please help! Good luck everyone!",""

Most vendors are targets, but safety is another issue. Many people who go here, however, are not necessarily targets, unless they buy something or admit to doing something explicitly threateningly illegal where an arrest is not only traced back but easily prosecuted. That is to say, if you buy/sell, you're looking at prison time. If you maintain discussion, there's a defense against it, albeit you'll still be viably interrogated for guilt by association. So yes and no, is the answer. We're definitely better off than SR, if that's your question, but nothing is forever, so don't hold your breath. Just don't believe you're a huge target. A target, yes, but not a huge one, depending on the circumstance, of course. The admins will take the bullet if things go sour, though, most likely.","paylap wrote:Are we safe?"

"Evolution Forums","maltivera","31393","2014-11-09T03:46:38","Re: Why Tor and VPN?","Security & Anonymity","depending on the ISP, they won't care and can't do anything to infiltrate you because you use tor. Using Tor to connect to your VPN is MUCH MORE effective, because you never know when your VPN might keep some debug data that leaves in your IP, and tor hides it. In the end, tor isn't incriminating, but if a VPN is given a warrant, your real IP is troublesome.

I do remember when they arrested someone from Holland after he made a serious threat using EarthVpn. EarthVpn claims they keep no logs and explained the reason authorities were able to locate the user was because they obtained logs from EarthVpn's data center/ISP. (not the vpn itself). They also claim to have moved to a new data center since the incident, but who knows if that's true.  A Vpn may prolong or even discourage the continuation of an investigation, but if they really want you, they will go the extra mile.

You're stating that mullvad is not secure because of their ISPs needing to keep logs? But to differeniate one person from another in these logs that they claim that they dont keep, is it even possible? I know that your ISP can review your MAC-adress and access several parameters to control what you are doing on the net. But is it written out in the clear for mullvads ISP?  I'm not claiming to know the correct answer to this question, but since I am from the country in question and that I consider myself to atleast be OK on OPSEC. We've got some big problems with anonymity and freedom of speech in this country, but wouldnt this claim be applied to services like countermail also? Is that also considered 'not safe' for you? ^ From what I know about countermail is that they will never disclose who you are to LE, but they can provide them with encrypted emails and so on going to and from your CM. But other than that no help will be provided. Of course this could just be a scam but, considering the large amounts of people using these services I am not to keen on instantly changing my views here. I mean, every vendor that's operating from sweden pretty much seems to be using mullvad (no evidence on this, just pondering here..  ) - yet we've only had like 3 arrests, SweExpress, Trampdyna/D.R.U.G.S and probably the two vendors that swedish police claimed to have detained 7 days ago when all of our beloved DNM's got seized.  Again, not trying to come in here with big claims, if you can school me go on doing so because learning is more important than being right. But this is pretty amazing info if its correct nonetheless. Depending on what ISP you're using in Sweden also, fEx Tele2 and Bahnof are pretty darn straight on advocating privacy on the net, Bahnof even got their own built in VPN to use for a low cost in conjunction with your regular broadband-subscription. Tele2 dont have these features built in but they are pretty keen on keeping their customers traffic anonymous and safe to the extent they can, which they've always strived towards. Just some insight as I said, I've lived in this country for the most time of my life and have been interested in surveillance since FRA, IPRED and other government issued programs launched/got light shed on them.

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","31393","2014-11-13T14:09:45","Re: Why Tor and VPN?","Security & Anonymity","Using Tor is perfectly legal, so in some sense... you might not need to use anything other than Tor. In other scenarios, you may want to further protect yourself and that's where VPN comes in.  VPN basically masks your IP address. If your in New York for example and you connect to a private VPN server in Romania then the output IP address (masked) would be a Romanian IP address but your actual IP address remains the same. So if you're using Tor, it's just another weapon in your armory to cover your identity. That doesn't mean you are bulletproof because you are using Tor AND VPN. Tor is extremely reliable but it's not flawless, it's quite possible to find out that you are using Tor but maybe not what you are using it for. That rhymes but you get the point. It's down to whoever is stalking you on the big WWW to find your exit node and they then have your identity but with so many people using Tor, it's not exactly a walk in the park to do that which is why the project encourages people to use Tor because the more people using Tor, the more people setting up relays into the network; the more people are online using it and the more secure it becomes. Like they say ""People have power in numbers"". There is so much controversy with VPN though. Who do you choose and why? There are many VPN providers out there that provide a service of good quality but will fuck you over come a time (if and when) a government agency wants to know something about someone or something. You'll get companies that will un-button their trousers without there even being a viable legal case, then you'll get those that will take it as far as they can go before the law slaps them with imprisonment and either way, what happens after that is confiscation of data and we all know what happens after that. No service on the internet is going to go to prison for you, it's best you learn that quickly before presuming that everyone is your friend. So it's hard to say who REALLY IS a good VPN provider because unless you work for the provider and you know specifically and unequivocally that no logs are saved, no personal information is recorded etc. Then it's a battle between presumption and facts.  That's why it's best to use tried and tested secure methods of using computer systems and accessing the internet like Tails and Tor. Using encryption methods like TrueCrypt, and although it's now redundant because no-one is actively working on it, they has never been ANY report of it's protection becoming obsolete. Perhaps even run an encrypted VM (virtual machine). The only way you know you are pretty damn safe is by using the basics and not complicating everything. Tails is reliable and all traffic inbound and outbound goes through Tor, Tor as we all know is reliable also and the two hand in hand are probably you're best bet for anonymous access to the internet.  That being said it all comes down to chance and what you use Tor for. No government agency is going to come chasing you because you believe in your right to have un-censored and uncontrolled anonymous internet access unless of course you break the law or they have a reason to believe you have or you are involved in some form of hacktivism/activism. But if you're using Tor to peddle kilos of heroin and cocaine around, the chance of being rumbled is entirely down to the process of elimination and the chance of anything coming of it. I hope that's low for everybody but who knows..",""
"Evolution Forums","uniz","31393","2014-11-13T20:50:15","Re: Why Tor and VPN?","Security & Anonymity","A VPNs ISP/Datacenter can still monitor the incoming encrypted data and outgoing unencrypted data (and back), regardless if the vpn logs or not. If they were trying to identify you, they can check the size of the packet and or when it was sent. Then correlate the two and match it to you. It's called netflow analysis. But there are methods a VPN can employ to prevent this from happening. A vpn that is multiplexing(combining all user connections to one encrypted stream of data) though multiple nodes(vpns) and crowd optimizating would make netflow analysis useless. ex.you -> regular encrypted data ->  first vpn -> multiplex encrypted data -> second vpn --> plain text --> destination The ISP of both vpns would not be able to connect you to any of the data being sent, even with netflow analysis. However if your adversary found out who you are IRL by a mistake you made....they'll monitor you from YOUR ISP and match the packets size to that of the destinations. But this can be defeated too if the VPN packet streams are morphed or padded to a certain number of bytes per packet. The only thing that may work is a timing attack in which they match the timestamps of data you sent with the timestamps of the receiving destination. They still need to know who you are first. But lets say they don't know who you are, then they would analyze ALL traffic from all entry nodes/vpns/isps of multiple countries to find you. But that's NSA type shit and probably used only if you're a serious threat to mankind or something like that.  If your vpn don't use these methods(most don't and are single-hop) this should not be an issue in terms of revealing your true ip if you're connecting to ToR/sock5 before connecting to the a VPN. Or you can use doublevpn. They route their vpn connections through different countries which means different jurisdictions and stronger anonymity.

If they were trying to identify you, they can check the size of the packet and or when it was sent. Then correlate the two and match it to you. It's called netflow analysis. But there are methods a VPN can employ to prevent this from happening. A vpn that is multiplexing(combining all user connections to one encrypted stream of data) though multiple nodes(vpns) and crowd optimizating would make netflow analysis useless.ex.you -> regular encrypted data ->  first vpn -> multiplex encrypted data -> second vpn --> plain text --> destinationThe ISP of both vpns would not be able to connect you to any of the data being sent, even with netflow analysis. However if your adversary found out who you are IRL by a mistake you made....they'll monitor you from YOUR ISP and match the packets size to that of the destinations. But this can be defeated too if the VPN packet streams are morphed or padded to a certain number of bytes per packet. The only thing that may work is a timing attack in which they match the timestamps of data you sent with the timestamps of the receiving destination. They still need to know who you are first. But lets say they don't know who you are, then they would analyze ALL traffic from all entry nodes/vpns/isps of multiple countries to find you. But that's NSA type shit and probably used only if you're a serious threat to mankind or something like that. If your vpn don't use these methods(most don't and are single-hop) this should not be an issue in terms of revealing your true ip if you're connecting to ToR/sock5 before connecting to the a VPN.

"Evolution Forums","goodguydealer","31393","2014-11-14T12:43:22","Re: Why Tor and VPN?","Security & Anonymity","Hi there, thanks for the response. And yes, I know why you'd use a VPN, I use one instance of mullvad on my first router, then the second on another internal router acting as a wifi repeater mainly, and one in my computer that's changing country every now and then. I dont log on tor and social networking sites at the same time - or anything else that might make me subject for data-analysis hacks in that sense, I dont claim to be a pro but I've gotten a pretty good understanding about how it works since we've got NSAs pet-agency FRA here in sweden, I've grown up pretty paranoid.  I dont know though how safe it is to even use the same VPN provider like this in a row, would love to hear points on it and what I can do to arrange it better. My PCs are encrypted with truecrypt as well indeed, with locked containers and USB drives to host my files that I feel are too uncomfortable to stick on my other drives. Also using disk scrubbers of all sorts to ensure that cache is properly cleaned every day. Not exactly to willing to give away all my info regarding the OPSEC I'm running but yeah, I've thought this over several times with risk assessment being the main point of view, but I might even look into getting another VPN-provider as well then. And the reason for me to believe in Mullvad is that I've heard alot of peoples own opinions on it, file sharers, drug dealers and other ""criminals"" that have been safe with only using one instance of mullvad + encrypting their drives. So that has led me to feel comfortable using the service. But its nice to learn other peoples view on it and to change my own.  Been looking into TAILS the last few weeks but I like to have an pretty good understanding of the OS I'm using.  And yes, I do know that so long as you dont traffic nuclear bombs and so on you're usually not in the middle of the scope for FBI/NSA and other LE that actually matters.  But yeah, thanks for the insight. And yes I've gotten to the understanding that privacy friendly is NOT the same thing as crime friendly  I'd love to continue on discussing this with anyone through PMs, preferably PGP encrypted just for the hell of it. Don't want to reveal to much about yourself on the forums, especially as a vendor. Thanks again for the replys!","fruitful wrote:Using Tor is perfectly legal, so in some sense... you might not need to use anything other than Tor. In other scenarios, you may want to further protect yourself and that's where VPN comes in. VPN basically masks your IP address. If your in New York for example and you connect to a private VPN server in Romania then the output IP address (masked) would be a Romanian IP address but your actual IP address remains the same. So if you're using Tor, it's just another weapon in your armory to cover your identity. That doesn't mean you are bulletproof because you are using Tor AND VPN. Tor is extremely reliable but it's not flawless, it's quite possible to find out that you are using Tor but maybe not what you are using it for. That rhymes but you get the point. It's down to whoever is stalking you on the big WWW to find your exit node and they then have your identity but with so many people using Tor, it's not exactly a walk in the park to do that which is why the project encourages people to use Tor because the more people using Tor, the more people setting up relays into the network; the more people are online using it and the more secure it becomes. Like they say ""People have power in numbers"".There is so much controversy with VPN though. Who do you choose and why? There are many VPN providers out there that provide a service of good quality but will fuck you over come a time (if and when) a government agency wants to know something about someone or something. You'll get companies that will un-button their trousers without there even being a viable legal case, then you'll get those that will take it as far as they can go before the law slaps them with imprisonment and either way, what happens after that is confiscation of data and we all know what happens after that. No service on the internet is going to go to prison for you, it's best you learn that quickly before presuming that everyone is your friend. So it's hard to say who REALLY IS a good VPN provider because unless you work for the provider and you know specifically and unequivocally that no logs are saved, no personal information is recorded etc. Then it's a battle between presumption and facts. That's why it's best to use tried and tested secure methods of using computer systems and accessing the internet like Tails and Tor. Using encryption methods like TrueCrypt, and although it's now redundant because no-one is actively working on it, they has never been ANY report of it's protection becoming obsolete. Perhaps even run an encrypted VM (virtual machine). The only way you know you are pretty damn safe is by using the basics and not complicating everything. Tails is reliable and all traffic inbound and outbound goes through Tor, Tor as we all know is reliable also and the two hand in hand are probably you're best bet for anonymous access to the internet. That being said it all comes down to chance and what you use Tor for. No government agency is going to come chasing you because you believe in your right to have un-censored and uncontrolled anonymous internet access unless of course you break the law or they have a reason to believe you have or you are involved in some form of hacktivism/activism. But if you're using Tor to peddle kilos of heroin and cocaine around, the chance of being rumbled is entirely down to the process of elimination and the chance of anything coming of it. I hope that's low for everybody but who knows.."

The FBIâs request infers that public gripes against ostensibly strong encryption by officials like FBI Director James Comey, GCHQ Director Robert Hannigan, and former NSA General Counsel Stewart Baker are mere theater.

What is the threshold? I don't know.

The first times i used DNMs i used a really weak web PGP Its quite hard to get OpSec that will really keep you anonymous. Now im a bit worried because the first purchases i made were on pandora/c9 where ive used bad OpSec (especially weak PGP). However i only ordered small amounts of light stuff. Do you guys know if DNMs (especially c9/pandora) keep all saleinfos or if they delete it after a while? For the last few months my OpSec has been up to date, however, like i said, during the first purchases i didn't know a lot of those things. It also would be interesting to know if, due the SR1 bust a year ago, the LE did target low level buyers who did use bad opsec (i didn't find anything bout that).

Now I know most people use burner phones, but if you're a target, and you use your new burner phone to contact your old contacts then you've basically told LE that this is your new number.Apart from being cautious with what and how you say things via calls or text - it doesn't remove the possibility that your new number and phone are compromised.Furthermore getting pulled over with 3 burner phones and a black berry is such a stereotypical situation for your token drug dealer.If they haven't already got your logged messages/calls, they do now if they arrest you... Which leads me to technology, encryption, apps...There are solutions out there made for people who might have more to lose than a few years dealing drugs. These apps were made for whistle blowers, and hactivists in mind, so promising and ensuring their security against government agencies should be real (no?). Most of them market end-to-end encryption, and for the unskilled in cryptography this sounds like the same great, single, unbeatable method used in all apps.Not sure about forum rules about clearnet linking but some you might like to look up are: Silent Text, Silent circle's Blackphone, Kontalk, Confide, Wickr, Telegram, whispersystems I was wondering if anyone more knowledgeable could chime in as to whether these apps could/should replace burner phones. As well as, whether in general if it is good OPSEC to even think about using them. Apologise in advance if this shit is basic, come at me cryptography experts.",""

Interested. I'm trying put your event into context... If LE requests whatever info they have on me, it would be identifiable data about my account, and w/e on my phone/cloud, messages, and phone calls (if a tap or intercept hasn't already been set up). At this stage, LE should already know who I am.  Now how about if you avoid the trackable communication lines? No phone calls about ""stuff"", no use of SMS about ""stuff"".Eliminates any ""incriminating"" data/evidence LE can obtain through their channels of requesting it from either Apple or Network Carriers. Instead any comms are messages only and are encrypted end-to-end and deleted off both devices.I'm worried that with XMPP+OTR on the phone, the messages could still remain in the phones memory.Whereas, Wickr markets that they forensically delete the messages from the memory. Which is a positive if LE gets physical access to the phone and are even bothered/resourceful enough to dig into the phone. From what I've read about encryption and messaging, the main threat is MITM attacks (man-in-the-middle)?But this is overcome by things like authentication, like I have seen using XMPP + OTR.Surely, these apps would have a solution for MITM attacks... Also, if LE aren't detecting any suspicious behaviour via phone calls or SMS - would they dig so far as to try and attempt a MITM attack on your encrypted messaging if they can't tell and don't know that you are using encrypted messages?So at the end of the day it seems the only way this would be a bad idea is if the App you chose to protect you gave your communication logs to LE.XMPP + OTR would fix that though as you control these logs...

I was thinking that if nothing is stored then they have no use of your encryption key?But would they possibly be able to intercept the encrypted messages and store them for later use? That is shit scary. It seems they do help but standard security practice would be to minimise the amount of secrets they have to hide, so they don't store encrypted messages.","PurpleChemists wrote:You can change the setting so no logs/messages are stored.;PurpleChemists wrote:This comes back to trusting a company what they say and what they do in a situation then LE are crawling all over them.;PurpleChemists wrote:This highly depends on the evidence they have against you already.

Easy as shit and 100 times better than any windows system. It's pretty obvious you don't understand encryption. There is encryption available right now that cannot be broken. It's shit like windows with logging and backdoors that makes it possible.  If you are a computer idiot stay out of here until you get the hang of the basics otherwise you are in for a world of hurt.

Then add your chain from there. Make Firefox use the chain in the box in your screenshot. Did you add the Proxifier LSPs? It should add to winsock, and will warn you in red text in the log box in the lower half of the main program's window if you didn't, and will tell you the tool for how to, which is bundled. and no worries, zigandzag.

Meaning you would by default have all traffic inside the Windows box go via Tor, and then you add SOCKS on top of that when needed. The advantage of this is in comparison to just using Tor Browser Bundle and Proxyfier is that the Whonix-Gateway is so hardened that the risk of leaks is much, much lower. And if something gets leaked, it will still only be leaks from Tor - never (well, that's a strong word, but you catch my drift) from the originating IP. Here is a link for how it is done, you just have to tweak a bit to if you want it done for another OS than Kali: Sorry. Not allowed to post links, I see. PM if you want the link.

Well ring0 always trumps everything. As for debugger, it was babble, not entirely relevant, unless you're analyzing malware samples, or cracking with ASM.  also for your torification, I've mentioned tortilla which torifies stuff. Or proxifier. But tortilla specializes in tor. P.S. I get enough bullying from troll [excuse the obscenity:] ""a-holes,"" in other communities, one being d3k [who's now gone] so I would never inflict that on anyone else. At most I express my brutal honesty almost always, but I certainly don't go out and find topics to troll. I was just trying to help....but seeing as our internet has enough jerks, not a big deal since I've been accused before and it's often hard to tell through text as opposed to verbal. However, if I am being a bit offensive, I apologize, I'm trying to be up-front, not for causing disasters; I am incredibly opinionated - I try to keep that to a minimum on this community compared to other ones, for reasons I won't get into.

To quote Arcana,  ""Note : TrueCrypt 7.1a can be considered safe. 7.2 cannot. Do NOT download TC 7.2. Download TC 7.1a here : https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm -------------------------- Using TrueCrypt 7.1a, the most secure method of encryption is : AES-Twofish-Serpent cascading encryption with the XTS method. Use the Whirlpool hash algorithm. (SHA-512 is a very close 2nd place here. It's debatable. I'm leaning towards Whirlpool because SHA-512 is already having a successor developed because of fears that it is based on an older SHA-1 that has been compromised.) Most important is to use a very strong password. 20 to 30+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols. Use Microsoft's online password checker for a strength test. You can also use keyfiles to further secure your password. You should use the AES-Twofish-Serpent over the Serpent-Twofish-AES because you want the outermost encryption (AES will be the first layer they need to break) to be the most standard in the industry. That one is the most tried and true and the most tested of all of them. Plus, if someone assumes a file is encrypted with AES, there's no way of seeing that is is then encrypted with Twofish... so they do all this work to break the AES, only to find that Twofish stands in their way now. And then again after Twofish they run into Serpent, which is the biggest beast of them all (even though it is less used / tested than AES, it still has a much higher security margin than AES) If you do use Keyfiles, have TrueCrypt create 3 keyfiles for you. Create one keyfile for each hash algorithm they provide. You might also add some .jpg's and some .mp3 files as well. You should make sure to make each keyfile read-only.""

But obviously they aren't black hat in any way shape or form and are more commercial so that being said, their authenticity is questionable. But most VPN providers are. You'll find that NO-ONE is going to prison for you, if you've done something illegal and you are being investigated, most companies whether small or big will rat you out to save their own skin, after all those guys who hand-craft and promote their services don't know you and that's the sad world we live in. As much as we want to protect each other, the minute the curtain falls and it turns to darkness you'll surprised how many do what they thought they'd never have to do and fuck their customers/clients/following over. I'd just bare that in mind with ANY VPN service. I'd stick to the services you KNOW are tried and tested, the only time the government ever gained access to TPB were when the Swedish well weak from the US and allowed them to extract information from their datacenter. And it took them years to get access, we aren't talking days or weeks. And look at ISOHunt; it took those guys a matter of weeks to be shutdown and they turned legit and lost their audience (not sure about now though) and the same with the majority but TPB?

"Evolution Forums","N-rG","26082","2014-09-30T12:35:55","Re: Security questions","Security & Anonymity","Hi Iron Heart, don't use VPN services. They are not to be safe than it is said. Actually its only wasted money. They all log, so in the end you have no advance of it. The only advance is when you use TOR over VPN that your provider doesn't know you use TOR. But the installation is not that easy but with some know-how possible. But when you want a VPN for security tracking, its useless! Finally, while Iâm tempted to do a more formal write-up elsewhere, let me be crystal clear about something: a claim that âdatacentre logsâ could be used to âidentify a customerâ of a legitimate network security service (aka, âVPN serviceâ) is complete, total horseshit. Making such a claim either means that suppliers are so ignorant of the fundamentals of network security that they can say this and actually think itâs true (which seems unlikelyâ¦ I mean, thatâs astonishing ignorance) or that they think they can lie their ass off and nobody will notice because most folks trust other folks to tell the truth, more or lessâ¦ particularly when they are speaking in a professional capacity on a technical subject. Whichever the case, itâs disgusting. (yes, I am familiar with theoretical traffic-analysis-based attacks on network anonymity and, no, it is not in the least bit likely that this was deployed in current context â indeed, itâs an attack that has yet to be documented in the wild and has not even proved successful in the NSAâs extensive & well-funded campaign to subvert Torâs security modelâ¦ so to imagine that local Dutch cops have perfected such a technique is laughable. Simply put, they placed a call to the morons running âearthvpnâ who promptly caved â just like HideMyAss, vtunnel, and others in the past who have been publicly exposed for doing thisâ¦ and thereâs a hell of alot more who have done it but not yet been outed in public, this I know firsthand â when faced with a little bit of pressureâ¦ then, they lied about it to try to blame someone else) What the lesson learned here says is this: donât âtrustâ some me-too, technically inept, inexperienced, profit-driven, marketing-heavy âVPN serviceâ to protect you from a damned thing. These newbie cash-grab schemes are all the rage nowadaysâ¦ but their security is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Weâve been documenting this drift towards hypeware/scamware, for yearsâ¦ hell, Iâve been writing detailed technical forensic posts on specific examples myself, for years. One after another. Earlier this week, I worked with Baneki Privacy Labs to expose a âVPN serviceâ thatâs circulating identical âprivate keysâ for RSA session validation to every single fucking customer, and posting the keys publicly onlineâ¦ and, at least one other âVPN serviceâ is using identical âprivate keysâ in their own crypto configuration. No, I am not making this up. Itâs posted and documented. You know what? Nobody cares. No journalists or bloggers follow these debacles. Nobody asks hard questions of these âVPN servicesâ that betray their customers, screw up their tech so badly that itâs utterly useless as a âsecurityâ toolâ¦ or both. The entire model of âscammy me-too âVPN serviceâ runs ads on scammy âVPN reviewâ website and gets great reviews from said website, leading to SEO nirvana and tons of sign-upsâ has grown roots so deep it seems like nobodyâs willing to note the emperorâs lack of clothes. Well, the emperor is indeed stark naked. This is good to know if youâre someone who is investing in âVPN serviceâ because they actually need network security and not merely because they want to engage in a charity campaign to support incompetent technologists too lazy or clueless to get a real job doing real tech work that really provides value. Hats off to schoolofprivacy for publicizing this, and for Wipe Your Data for noting it in the first place. Now, letâs see if TorrentFreakâs boys jump all over it (like their âreportâ on the âalien technologyâ proof crypto snake oil of PIA)- and Ars writes up an expose. Or not. You can guess what my prediction is, for whatever itâs worthâ¦ If you want to be safe, buy a Notebook, which supports Hardware encryption. Use a BIOS and HardDisk Password. Have only an OS installed. Use all other (TOR etc.) on a separate external disk encrypted with VeraCrpt (triple secured and more advanced than truecrypt). With that you a really safe. Web Traffic is never 100% safe!

Not only does it protect you from your own logging by your own ISP, but it protects you from many malicious attacks because the VPN address If properly configured by a reputable company, the VPN address will not respond to Ping requests so it is immune to drive by attacks. i have no issue with people saying that VPN is not good for security. it all depends on the situation and what you are trying to accomplish. what it does do is add an extra layer of traffic routing. whether the VPN company logs your activities or not is really irrelevant. another advantage of VPN - at least in US - is that i can put myself at a location outside the US which allows me to do many things i can't if my IP shows me inside the US. for example many offshore casinos (even BetFair) will not accept wagers from inside US, so by grabbing a Canadian IP i can use these sites. they have an interconnected banking type of arrangement - where funds can be moved from on sports book to another at no cost. so i can bet at Pinnacle and collect via debit card card deposit from another book. also NFL gamepass is only available to users outside US, as are many other broadcasts. there are a ton of advantages to  VPNs- when discussion gets focused only on illegal activities, it often overlooks a the big picture. For example, just because you can get drugs through customs doesn't mean local LE won't nail you. you'll be fine with VPN as long as you assume it is just an extension of your own IP and therefore can be traced back to you.",""

BTW you can install any OS you want in the Whonix gateway - you don't necessarily have to use the Whonix client. also every Whonix Gateway has the same IP address - which of course TOR handles.

As for your system, you are definitely best off finding a laptop with a 64bit processor. You can get a cheap i3 or even an i5 laptop for around $300 second-hand and if it's in good condition and decent spec with at least 4GB of RAM and a decent sized HDD then you are good to go. If you are only using it for specific tasks then you don't really need anything more than that, embedded graphics will do fine as will any need for fancy shenanigans. i3 has 2 cores so effectively dual-core but the new standard, i5 is also dual-core but a better version of i3 ie faster, more reliable and the top end i5 processors are baseline i7 quad-core processors and you could even pick a cheap second-hand top end i5 laptop for $300-500 and it's definitely an investment in my opinion and you'll no doubt get more spec with a top-end i5. Always make sure you wipe the drive before using it, even if the guy who sells it you says it's been wiped - you don't know what he's been doing on the laptop. And it's your obligation and your responsibility to wipe it once you get it. You can use a program called CCleaner that can wipe drives with security passes which basically uses random write patterns to each pass of the hard drive rendering any file on the drive completely un-accessible. As you will know a standard reformat only deletes the pointer to the file or if it deletes the file, it doesn't delete it completely from the computer which can be easily recovered with drive forensic software.

TAILS is being constantly updated which requires a new burn with every update. there is actually a checksum that that you need to compare. most of the compromising comes in by injecting malicious code into the ISO image. That is relatively simple to do, so it's always a good idea to verify and download. so far as NSA using a keylogger to alter the burn goes, seems pretty far fetched to me, but when you talk about the NSA they are liable to do anything, so i wouldn't say it is impossible, just unlikely. from what i have read by Bruce Schnier (sp?) and others they have an arm called TAO or something that maintains a database of computers and what vulnerabilities they have. then sparingly (they don't have the time or resources to target many individuals - their efforts are aimed more mass data collection any the use of sophisticated data analysis algorithms to extract data in the interest of national security) and carefully they can target specific PCs. it's not a common practice unless you are in their crosshairs as result the above mentioned data analysis.  personally, i use burner USB NICS so to their efforts it probably appears as a different computer with different NICs (and MACs). so far as anti-forensic stuff goes - i need to re-examine some aspects of it in light of NSA revelations. i just am super busy at the moment, but hopefully i will get to it soon. If you use a Tails DVD (it's too big to fit on CD) you can even pull the hard drive out of the laptop (you may have change the BIOS setup to keep the box from complaining) also you may need a storage option - you can make a persistent volume that goes on a USB stick in conjunction with the TAILS DVD. i am a bit confused about the reason for using PGP to encrypt a file and then burn it to a DVD. then what - do you mail it to somebody someone? nowadays everything is getting encrypted - even google is now HTTPS. of course NSA supposedly has cracked SSL3 but that's just a rumor. but like they say - just cause you are paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you. the level of security you need is in proportion to the risk you are taking. personally i don't like cell phones. those damn things ping the towers even when turned off. i have heard that with hardware technology like the Stingray they can actually turn the phone on and listen to your conversations like a planted audio bug. google 'cops stingray' it's downright scary. not only can even small budget police departments get it, but they are forced to sign a disclosure agreement where they can't even admit that they bought it. it hijacks wholesale whole cell towers, so it can pick you up even if you were not the initial target. i saw a big article today about the strong encryption on the new iphone and LE is complaining that every pedophile will get one. the headline read that 'New Iphone will be favorite of pedophiles' what a crock of shit. they mention pedophile as a scare tactic to the timid public. the DEA has been bitching for years about being unable to crack the encryption on text messages on Iphones. but the damned thing still leaves a trail of everywhere you go. we are working on a hardware solution (USB stick) that sniffs all the traffic in and out of your pc and presents it in an understandable format to the user. it's based on the premise that malware is just a nuisance unless it talks to some mother ship. so if it is talking it is possible to monitor that talk yourself.

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","8971","2014-09-27T23:07:09","Re: PGP message burned to CD safe?","Security & Anonymity","What I don't understand is privacy is a basic human right. When we use CCleaner it doesn't make anyone a criminal it just simply means that the person using it prefers to make certain their data has been completely deleted without a chance of it being obtained. But if anyone does that, they are evading the criminal justice system. Just like if we encrypt our internet communications we are apparently cyber terrorists averting prying eyes. No, we have a right to privacy and a right to deny fascism and pathetic laws obtained by governments to make the internet a weak controlled zone where no information is safe, so we might as well give our usernames and passwords up, if we have safes we might as well give our safe PINs up because... anything we do is considered in contempt. In reality, it's the opposite and if they have no evidence on you because they cannot retrieve information from your laptop then they simply have no evidence. Bullying and harassing is all part of their game but if you know what you are doing and make light of it, they will have no choice but to let you go. Truth is, the government is just as corrupt and dark as the dark net itself if not worse. Politicians all over the world commit criminal offences, notorious government agencies act like terrorist networks in their own right, committing crimes, disregarding people's rights to basic essentials like privacy and a right to freedom  but they get away with it whilst the general public have to be an example of weakness and succumb to everything and anything whilst waving goodbye to our freedoms. Which is why the government can't help but to accept the fact that the world is realising the intentions of our governments and freedom and human rights fighting groups are getting ever more stronger. In the world, there are just as many hackers working against the government as there are working for the government, just as many 'criminals' as they are working in government establishments. It's just about keeping the numbers to outweigh the government. I say the best advice is to stay safe with PGP is DELETE every message once you have read it, that involves using a decent file delete software like CCleaner and have it run multiple passes. I think 7 passes is the DOD standard for permanent data removal and then there is the Guttmann method which is 35 passes which uses even more patterns to re-write the information and even more passes to ensure the original data will never be read again and encrypt your hard drive including any external hard drive. Use a decent encryption method like PGP and make sure the passphrase is at least 10 characters long if not longer, maybe 15 or even 20. Both upper case, lower case, numerals and symbols. That way it would literally take a bruteforce attack about a million years to crack a password that utilizes the full potential of the encryption method. Just be aware that big companies that are based in the USA are no doubt dealing with the likes of the NSA in regards to 'national security', companies like Symantec for example and will probably be flawed. So watch out which PGP encryption packages you use.  Also, DONT store your PGP messages anywhere. You are really backfiring on the whole idea of using PGP in the first place and come a time when you are in court, the chances are, they will be asking for your private key and your hidden PGP message. Delete it. And delete it properly. Proper removal = no evidence. But to be honest, you can never be too safe. Look at all the smartest guys in the dark 'industry' who have been busted by LE, the number is growing over the century. Even those that designed and distributed the most killer virus and malware are either behind bars or now working on behalf of the government contracted to internet security programmes. Just live with the mentality that PGP is sufficient if used correctly but it just isn't enough, in fact it's probably best to have the mentality that you are never safe enough. The fact that I bet most members on here will be using an ISP registered to their home address gives the game away regardless of PGP messages you send, if they can relate you to criminal activity online through your history then you are fucked anyway. The typical question 'Well, why do you use PGP and browse underground websites if you are a good guy?' springs to mind. So many routes to go down that compliment each preventative step, no point in sending PGP messages if your computer is infected with malware or a RAT for example. No point in using PGP if your using a redundant PGP standard (there are tonnes of debates about which software has been cracked and which hasn't, not all PGP standards are the same). And no point in using PGP if you are importing your PGP messages into text documents and then not removing them properly. And no point in using PGP if your private key is on the same computer you use to send PGP messages with. Each preventative step compliments the other. To be honest, to use the full potential of PGP you are best off using a laptop you don't use for anything else, get prepaid internet in the form of a 3G/4G dongle or even get access to a neighbours internet wirelessly (yup they are SHIT but there are no registered names and addresses and wireless hacking isn't really that hard) and just hope to God you aren't being tapped and a simple GSM/3G jammer will stop you if they want to isolate you but they can disconnect their ADSL line anyway if they need too and that includes your fibre-optic too. Just use your dongle and use it specifically with Tails. No information stored on the laptop, no traces. Just a bootable OS. And no tied-to ISP. But like I said, if you haven't covered A then there's no point in skipping to B. Most people skip the most important steps, the most simple steps thinking such methods will hide them and will make them invincible to anyone wanting to do harm to them in one way or 'another'.

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","30789","2014-11-05T08:39:41","Re: Proxify Java DNS & Flash","Security & Anonymity","are you talking about javascript or JAVA? i generally examine all javascript code in a sandbox before i access it for real. JAVA itself is a full blown development environment and often requires a runtime environment client to be installed on the box. on the other hand JAVA applets can be inserted into HTML code to run as an executable capable of doing whatever the programmer coded. for DNS my most recent recommendation is to build your own. of course this requires that you know the IP addresses associated with specific hostnames. by building your own DNS and point your network settings at it, there is no need for additional security and no leaks. as far as flash goes, it has been deprecated and is a huge security risk. i will not even run Flash on any clearnet page. i don't think it is even supported at all by html5 (i may be wrong about that) which is the standard for mobile devices. you are just asking for trouble using Flash. BTW most people don't realize the risk of malicious code executing ftom .pdf files. you should NEVER open any downloaded file while you are still on line. personally i off load them to a USB stick and open them on an air-gapped box. this applies to PGP messages as well. anybody using PGP to communicate with vendors and decodes those messages while still on the market - might as well be using clear text. at the very least a moderator can be looking over your shoulder. if you are going to take the risk to involve yourself in activities that are subject to adversarial procedures (aka LE) then it is just plain stupid to make a rookie mistake and not use a different box (preferably air-gapped) to decode/encode PGP. while the VPN is a good start but if you want to proxify something to avoid sites that blacklist TOR exit nodes then you use proxifier to chain a proxy address to the end of TOR which then becomes your visible IP on the web. you buy lists of proxies or google for thousands of free ones. the free ones may or may not be usable. most of the lists that you buy are dedicated proxies. there are also some sites that are proxified by design. i can't recall one i use to use all the time to access Usenet since my ISP blocked me from downloading NTTP traffic as i was exceeding 50 GB a month. but anyway you go to these sites and they are already proxified and you can then access sites that would otherwise be unavailable for whatever reason - firewall restrictions, web monitoring software - whatever. of course these sites may have their own blacklists, both on incoming and outgoing traffic.  it makes no sense to talk about proxifing Java, DNS, & Flash. depending on how you acquired your VPN it may or may not be linked to you, but if you use it from your house, it definitely knows your real IP. whether or not it logs your activity and/or willingly hands over any such logs to legal authorities is a hotly debated topic. i use a VPN to block my IP from logging any of my browsing activities. this is sometimes a problem as all my sites come up in German and i can't access my email (without the 3rd degree) or bank account, but i generally do those activities on a different box rather than the one with a 24/7 VPN running. i could add a proxy so it would be ISP-->VPN-->TOR-->PROXY-->clearnet but i have no need to go on clearnet from TOR. there are sites that supposedly check your configuration for leaks, but how can they vouch that they catch 100% of leaks. most of them run a script and say if the scripts runs completely then you are probably safe.      one last note - SSH can be very useful if used correctly. your traffic is secure and immune to sniffing while in transit because it is in a tunnel. you can use SSH tunnels to get under firewalls and all sorts other neat things.

The reason, however, why people have such bad experiences with them, is NOT that they're using a VPN, but because THEY'RE USING HONEYPOT VPNs!!!  VPN is not the issue. It's the provider. VPN is a very beneficial factor, so as long as you pick the right one. I have to disagree 100% on vpns being bad. Some are bad, yes, but many are good.  You could argue SOME VPNs CAN be worse than not using one, but you canNOT argue that ALL are. confusedguy, obviously many are blacklisted. But that's the reason you don't use easy-access ones. You get a private-subscription VPN where the server is not in any ""history"" as spam, ddos, etc. However, you have just as much likelihood, if not purer chance of Tor being blacklisted, than you ever do with a vpn, public or not. Why in the world would you use a vpn server used by everyone everywhere for misuse? That's a determined mission to find yourself blocked. What vpns are you using as test subjects? Hidemya**? VPNbook? Hotspot Shield? I can't stress this enough, don't use publicly available vpns. Invest in a private one.

Say they get a subpoenaed, they can't see what exactly you search/do online, but they have your sign-in IP + Logs of time to sign in. Now they subpoena/co-operate with the business you carded or websites you visited, match the time frame you were in, and match the IP to the server you logged into. Now they know your IP logged into the VPN, at exactly what time you logged in, and they know what the dedicated VPN IP was doing.

"Evolution Forums","maltivera","26940","2014-10-16T01:19:52","Re: Am I safe to card?","Security & Anonymity","ALL servers through which data tunnels, can be used against you. However, the fact that vip72 gets its proxies from bot reverse proxies, keeps me away. I use tor. True, VPNs CAN be monitored, but then so is ANY form of communication...if you didn't want danger, then darkweb isn't for them...in the end, I'm not denying you should use a proxy, preferrably tor (and even then, it's possible for a fed to run a rogue node, theoretically speaking), but that doesn't exclude VPN. If you plan to use a cruddy VPN which keeps logs [whether it says it does or not] with its HQ or servers in ANY E.U. or North American country, then yeah you're asking for it, and you might as well use none. If you, however, CAN find a [LEGITIMATE/sufficient] vpn provider, it's still safer to use tor PLUS the vpn, than it is, to only use tor. VPN has its uses. It's a win or lose case-by-case basis. Sometimes it'll be worse if you are using one feeding logs to LE, but other cases, you'll be better off. As I've stated many many times in the past here, VPNs ARE worth it. Just because VPNs CAN be used to log and give data to LE, doesn't make ALL vpns useless let alone counterproductive as per FRiM's explanation. All it means is, if you don't plan to find an ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE vpn provider, it's as good as none. If you find a sufficient one, then definitely use it, because you're at an advantage than the ones who use NO vpn. Don't judge ALL vpns by what SOME do. VPNs CAN be legitimate, and some are fake, you just need to select wisely, as is the case with any software and proxy, too. VPN protects you...but only if you rely on the right one. That is to say, it's a benefit only if you make it be. P.S. you have JUST AS MUCH chance of logs being recorded, let alone applicable to warrant and seizure, with proxy, as you do with VPN. They're not that much distinctive with regards to, a., jurisdiction, and b., data collection and retention laws/policies. It's all the same science.  And Ozzyz, right-on! That's why, as opposed to many people here who use vpn>tor, I advice people to INSTEAD, use tor>vpn, so that while the site will know your VPN provider, it's first of all, not being as big a red flag, and 2nd of all, the fact that, as you have very efficiently stated, whether vpn says they log or not, they do [be-it in the form of packet logging or on analytics, VPN provider itself or the ISP servicing the provider], and using tor FIRST BEFORE connecting to the vpn through the TAP adapter, alleviates that liability, so that even if the VPN gets its records subpoenaed, or monitored, it won't matter, as their logs don't specify your TRUE IP address.

CCleaner also contains a bunch of functions to flesh it out that are now handled natively by windows (and some such as add or delete programs have been around forever, but CCleaner has whole routine devoted to this). this whole issue is complicated by the fact there are many versions of Windows and each uses different security features. so to develop an extensive application requires a lot of research. we also plan to include other routines in there that DW users might find useful like password crackers, and a bunch of other crap. any suggestions for added functionality would be greatly appreciated. there's tons of other stuff - so you can PM me if interested in helping or suggesting or whatever. go in peace and stay safe. - popa",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","30670","2014-11-03T13:55:37","hacking airgapped boxes","Security & Anonymity","the following was posted on Wired website today:      Computers housing the worldâs most sensitive data are usually âair-gappedâ or isolated from the internet. Theyâre also not connected to other systems that are internet-connected, and their Bluetooth feature is disabled, too. Sometimes, workers are not even allowed to bring mobile phones within range of the computers. All of this is done to keep important data out of the hands of remote hackers. But these security measures may be futile in the face of a new technique researchers in Israel have developed for stealthily extracting sensitive data from isolated machinesâusing radio frequency signals and a mobile phone. The attack recalls a method the NSA has been secretly using for at least six years to siphon data in a similar manner. An NSA catalogue of spy tools leaked online last year describes systems that use radio frequency signals to remotely siphon data from air-gapped machines using transceiversâa combination receiver and transmitterâattached to or embedded in the computer instead of a mobile phone. The spy agency has reportedly used the method in China, Russia and even Iran. But the exact technique for doing this has never been revealed. The researchers in Israel make no claims that theirs is the method used by the NSA, but Dudu Mimran, chief technology officer at the Israeli lab behind the research, acknowledges that if student researchers have discovered a method for using radio signals to extract data from hard-to-reach systems, professionals with more experience and resources likely have discovered it, too. âWe are doing research way behind people [like that],â he told WIRED. âThe people who are doing that are getting a lot of money and are doing that [full time].â Dubbed âAirHopperâ by the researchers at Cyber Security Labs at Ben Gurion University, the proof-of-concept technique allows hackers and spies to surreptitiously siphon passwords and other data from an infected computer using radio signals generated and transmitted by the computer and received by a mobile phone. The research was conducted by Mordechai Guri, Gabi Kedma, Assaf Kachlon, and overseen by their advisor Yuval Elovici. The attack borrows in part from previous research showing how radio signals (.pdf) can be generated by a computerâs video card (.pdf). The researchers in Israel have developed malware that exploits this vulnerability by generating radio signals that can transmit modulated data that is then received and decoded by the FM radio receiver built into mobile phones. FM receivers come installed in many mobile phones as an emergency backup, in part, for receiving radio transmissions when the internet and cell networks are down. Using this function, however, attackers can turn a ubiquitous and seemingly innocuous device into an ingenious spy tool. Though a company or agency may think it has protected its air-gapped network by detaching it from the outside world, the mobile phones on employee desktops and in their pockets still provide attackers with a vector to reach classified and other sensitive data. The researchers tested two methods for transmitting digital data over audio signals but Audio Frequency-Shift Keying (A-FSK) turned out to be the most effective. â[E]ach letter or character was keyed with different audio frequency,â they note in a paper released last week (.pdf) that describes their technique. âUsing less than 40 distinct audio frequencies, we were able to encode simple textual dataâboth alphabetical and numerical. This method is very effective for transmitting short textual massages such as identifiers, key-stroking, keep-alive messages and notifications.â The data can be picked up by a mobile phone up to 23 feet away and then transmitted over Wi-Fi or a cellular network to an attackerâs command-and-control server. The victimâs own mobile phone can be used to receive and transmit the stolen data, or an attacker lurking outside an office or lab can use his own phone to pick up the transmission. âWith appropriate software, compatible radio signals can be produced by a compromised computer, utilizing the electromagnetic radiation associated with the video display adapter,â the researchers write. âThis combination, of a transmitter with a widely used mobile receiver, creates a potential covert channel that is not being monitored by ordinary security instrumentation.       this is old news. Actually these techniques can be used on connected boxes as well. i think i posted before about how boxes can be compromised by detecting the signals emitted by the CPU while it is unencrypting data. this is not simple technology, but once in place the concept has been proven in a Starbucks usining an ordinary I-phone as a microphone to pick up the frequencies emitted by the cpu at a nearby laptop. my EE buddy tells me that sophisticated receivers are required because today's CPUs can operate at 3.7 gHZ and the frewuency of these emissions is very much lower. however this nothing more than an extension of technology used by spooks in the days of CRT monitors where they could intercept the traffic from across the street by measuring the emissions from the monitors.",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","30670","2014-11-05T07:00:41","Re: hacking airgapped boxes","Security & Anonymity","well i am used to reading clinical stuff like that. i had a guy ask me about my opinion of a 4GB USB stick from AMAZON. i don't remember the exact specs but i do recall that it had 120 FIPS encryption standard, which is a government specification much like the DOD orange classification that NTFS touted when it was first released as a replacement to FAT. that lasted about 2 seconds until those two guy (later bought out by M$ and formed Sysinternals) brought out ERD which allowed anybody to mount an NTFS partition and read and write to it with a HD 720 MB floppy disk. so much for DOD security. M$ response was that if someone had physical access to your system then it was compromised anyway, True enough, but it still begged the question. anyway i looked into the FIPS standard which i had never heard of before and found out that it is a government encryption spec that comes in levels from I-IV. the description of the standard only covers levels I & II which leads me to believe that description points to the old catch-22 where levels III & IV aren't discussable with anyone and may be even restricted to eyes only. in any event, since it's a government standard, i advised against using these sticks (they actually have full USB drives with this encryption that are designed to hold an OS) for the obvious reason that the government probably has a back door into them.  but one interesting thing about the differences in the levels was that the drives had built in security features like seals that would break if you pulled on the ends of the drive, sort of like the ones that have little sliders on them. they also had light sensitive opaque holograms that would betray a physical examination of the disk. so all of these things did happen in  a clinical setting. i have no idea who uses these things besides the government but the specs reveal companies that use the standard and the number one is McAfee and number 2 is Cisco for use in its routers. now i talked to my Electrical Engineer buddy today about this audio signal crap and he said that the technology is definitely viable. while he is not privy to the exact algorithm for actually decodng the data from the signals, he is an expert on radio, and said such a transceiver is definitely makeable. it would be extremely expensive and would require all sorts of black ops to employ it. but the article mentions China and Iran so who knows what these spooks are up to. to my way of thinking i would rather have NSA climbing barbed wire fences to monitor Irani uranium production than coming in my unlocked front door to install frequency monitors on my computers. that's more in the realm they are supposed to be in (and probably prefer as well). but on the other hand i did get interested in encrypted USB sticks, and ordered a couple (not FIPS) but Blowfish coupled with something else from Kingston and i was amazed at the difference in the quality of the drives compared to Cruzers, PNY, and even Toshibas. there are heavy duty stainless steel, and work great. i have no idea if they have back doors or not, but i am now definitely interested in buying higher end sticks, i can encrypt them myself to insure security. but back to the original post - definitely sounds like Asian technology as they are the only ones with the patience to work out the kinks of such a harebrained plan. besides even if they scaled the fence and broke the seal and stole the data - they would still have to figure out how to decrypt it. Or why would they have to break the seal at all to steal the data? but those guys live in a different universe.

 Last edited by whadafu (2014-11-09 04:40:08)","Sorry in advance for the length. I just want to make sure that
everything is included. If you have any questions/clarifications, just
ask. It isn't every day that someone like me pops up on tor-dev, and I
just want to make sure this is as productive and helpful as possible.
This will probably be a very humbling experience, because unlike my
fellow illegal onion operators both past and present, I will actually be
outside of a jail cell and able to read the ruthless dissection of my
set-up. On the bright side, you're all are getting way more info from me
than the pigs will ever willingly cough up, which means if they have
some sort of magic onion decloak trick, this mailing list discussion is
a good chance at finding it. All of these files are in the hands of the
cops anyway (And I have no plans of bringing doxbin back), so there are
0 real-time opsec concerns.

First, the files:

http://doxbin.strangled.net/
http://qhlkmirbijvet2dp.onion/

sha256 and sha512 checksums for all the files are at the bottom.
NOTE: This isn't my box and I didn't set it up.
WARNING: The .xz files will unpack to roughly 1 GB.

Some other info:

1. The box (An OpenVZ VPS) was hosted with Hetzner in Germany. People on
Twitter keep asking if the box was in Bulgaria, but we didn't use
Bulgaria for one simple reason: The very first doxbin box (Bought in
2011) was with a VPS company in Bulgaria. After the first month, they
said ""TOR IS ILLEGAL"" (I shit you not), killed the box, and kept the $5
we had paid for the 2nd month. Can't say I blame them.

2. It wasn't transproxied. We did this once before, but it became a
hassle to drop iptables rules just to upgrade tor, especially when tor
was getting regular updates semi-recently. Console access with VPS
companies generally requires java plugins or something just as gross, so
there aren't a lot of sane options here. It gets annoying when there's a
surge in the frequency of tor upgrades, so we stopped transproxying the
box. inb4 OMG OPSEC MISTAKE DETECTED!!!11

3. This script (And copypasta that contained its important parts) was
used to build nginx for the various boxes from roughly November 2011 to
mid-October 2014: http://pastebin.com/dBC7E8Jd Early versions didn't use
naxsi, and sed replaced the server banners in the source before
compiling. Yes, I know it doesn't verify the source. See the next point:

4. Around 2 weeks ago, I started grabbing dotdeb.org's source versions
of nginx and building .debs using hardening-wrapper with the following
command at the end:

DEB_CFLAGS_SET=""-O2 -fstack-protector-all -fforce-addr -ffast-math
-fomit-frame-pointer -falign-functions=64 -falign-loops=32""
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -j8

5. The tor build was from deb.torproject.org. I'm not able to check the
box and never thought to back up /etc/apt/sources, but it used the
experimental-wheezy repo. All updates were done within 24 hours of the
new .debs going live.

6. Last but not least, the elephant in the room: The php is a
headache-inducing nightmare. I inherited the code and it worked, so I
just papered over its defects over the years (There was no anti-flood
protection originally, for example) and built it up to resemble Kowloon
Walled City expressed in php. I have a feeling that a lot of focus is
going to be placed on the code, to the detriment of finding any possible
tor bugs. In any case, everything about doxbin's setup is being
disclosed in the spirit of making this an interesting learning
experience for all parties involved.

Upon scrolling through the .xz files (I personally use xzless), you'll
find a bunch of stuff like:

All of the requests were around (If I recall correctly) 3KB in size.
Oddly enough, it caused tor to hiccup pretty badly, although the web
server itself was just fine and I didn't have any network bandwidth
problems (i.e. No obscene traffic spikes). It's also worth pointing out
that the tcp buffers weren't even close to maxed. The same box has
handled a similar volume of legitimate requests before (Namely back in
March, after The Hidden Wiki debacle; see
https://twitter.com/loldoxbin/status/530765088366821377). The solution
to getting tor availability back was to set ConstrainedSockets to 1 and
play with  ConstrainedSockSize (Originally set to 8192, then 4096). This
made doxbin regularly available again, whereas before it was hit or
miss. Once the requests stopped, I waited a couple of days before
commenting those two config lines out and reloaded tor.

A month later, the same kinds of requests started coming in again. After
the first few hours, I started 301 redirecting all requests containing
/%5C%22 to the new Hidden Wiki's Hard Candy page. I also added a grep -v
to my log report script in order to filter out the noise (Possibly a
mistake, but we both tailed logs and watched for something like a
different attack style that the ddos was being used to cover and never
noticed anything). That was good enough to maintain availability, so I
rolled with it and the requests eventually stopped. I have no hard data
on that last point, just the fact that I tailed the access log and the
requests went from 5 per second to 1 every 3-6 seconds before dying off
completely.

I said on Twitter that we suspected it was a deanonymization attempt,
but I didn't elaborate why because LOL 140 CHARACTERS. Intangir (The
other admin, who took over for me from Halloween 2013 to some time
around July of this year) and I talked about it back in August and
decided that an attacker was probably involved spraying specially
crafted packets at the box in order to mess up its circuits, and
eventually get us on attacker-controlled nodes. Since we mitigated the
availability loss, we deemed it as no big deal. In hindsight, that seems
hilariously stupid/naive of us. The kid who started doxbin had a similar
theory that I'm just going to paste verbatim:

<founder> ANYWAY
<founder> i think
<nachash> CONTINUE
<founder> the attack
<founder> was to DoS you
<founder> until you created circuits
<founder> entirely made of dickbleedable nodes
<founder> and then dickbleeding them
<nachash> but the server
<nachash> got seized
<founder> yeah, the IP was discovered by dickbleed though
<founder> the entire circuit was leaking info
<nachash> lol, did you just reproduce this?
<founder> not yet, i'll be trying
<nachash> Do you mind if I share this with tor devs?
<founder> go ahead
<founder> its just a theory at the moment

If either of these theories even remotely pan out, a possible mitigation
for the next person like me (Which shouldn't require any tor dev work)
might look something like this:

1. Make several public relays and configure the torrc of the hidden
service to only make circuits which begin with those nodes. Private
bridges would be a liability in this case because anyone who figures out
the guard node by weaponizing one of attacks from a whitepaper (Which
guard nodes were modded to mitigate) will be able to find the guard node
and then quickly discover that it isn't part of the public tor network.
Public bridges might be ok, but probably less so.
2. Cross your fingers and pray really, really hard that the money trail
is correctly obscured.
3. ????
4. PROFIT! (Or lulz, in my case)

(No, the similarity between the idea of drug market operators giving
back to the network by donating nodes to the practice of drug cartels
building schools and hospitals is not lost on me)

Another thing to consider is the recommendation against running a hidden
service as a relay. Of course, the argument against doing so in the
documentation is very sound. At the same time, the FBI has stated in the
Silk Road criminal complaint that upon finding the IP, the investigator
verified that it wasn't a tor node and knew he had won the onion
lottery. Of course, that could still be psyops/parallel construction
garbage to scare people into making their jobs a little easier, but it's
something to thing about.

Inventory: -Brand new laptop, ready to be wiped and turned into a burner-Used unlocked android phone, also ready for wipe to burner-Anon sims for SMS verifications from Coinbase (will explain in a bit)-Anon USA bank drop (secure account with fullz)-Mock site for stripe after hosting-Funds for VPN/SOCKS5/Pizzas (all to be paid for via btc)  Burner Laptop setup: *EDIT - Updated* Host Debian -> VPN (Mullvad) -> VM running Whonix-Gateway -> TrueCrypt encrypted (AES-Twofish-Serpent) VM (Carding VM; running Windows) w/ spoofed MAC -> Tor -> VPN (Mullvad) -> vip72 SOCKS5 -> Browser (Firefox w/ sock configured, flash/java disabled) Questions on assembling the burner laptop:  1) Should I use public wifi for carding or will the security measures detailed above be enough for me to stay home and use my private wifi? 2) Is the VPN connected to my host OS necessary, or will the one run through the carding VM suffice?  Plan of action is as follows:  BASE OVERVIEW: -Ensure burner rig is secure; connect to VPN and connect to SOCK corresponding with Drop's location -Link Coinbase account to drop using fullz + burner phone for SMS verification (Will be able to link due to the drop being a clean account w/ fullz) to have direct access to btc purchased as opposed to Virwox -Host mock site on anon hosting (Arvixe), paying with btc -Set up Stripe account using Drop's fullz/bank info -Use anon card (linked to Drop bank account) to make initial charge to bypass the 7 day chargeback window that could close account -After 7 days start running cvv's at $50-$200 each, 4-6 per day, spread out over the day -After accruing enough in the drop, buy btc from coincase (again using burner for verification) -Send btc from coinbase through Helix, and from Helix into my legit coinbase account -Cash out btc from legit account into my bank   I'm sure I'm missing something or I should do something differently, so if any of you would be willing to rate my plan, as well as give advice where you feel it's needed, I would be very grateful. P.S.: sorry about the multiple threads, I kept getting d/ced and the thread kept getting resubmitted.

Also I've seen recommendations to route the connection from the carding (windows) VM through a Whonix gateway for an additional layer before it reaches the host OS.

The things that are being transmitted are the obvious being data, MAC, host name, signal strength, etc... Of course they could triangulate your position based on the signal strength and there's hardware applications out there that are currently used by LE however I've yet to come across a case that they actually pin pointed an individual doing this by such methods. If anyone knows of a case or white paper about such things please post a link to the community.  Anyone on that network could of course sniff you traffic, MiTM, etc... but hopefully you're well versed in such tactics and are aware of these. Hence VPN's, TOR, etc.  Plus using a pre-paid CC to purchase any kind of equipment and have it shipped to your address doesn't mean YOU the owner purchased it.

It's a virtually-capsuled wifi spot which has a weak or has no password. They collect data from there. What defines ""high target"" is the more legitimately appropriate question. They can also ARP poison you through the LAN, causing you to visit a landing page via redirect, with an exploit. It's been done before. Have you also never heard of LANspy? You can distribute malware through a network. Heck you can shut down computers that are in the same workgroup. Imagine what they can do if you're hooked into their wifi, doesn't matter whether you use stealth mode or not, it still is possible. Try testing tools that do this in Kali Linux, you'll find a buttload. It's not retarded, it's common sense, no offense. what about intercepting messages and traffic via dsniff? These are not new holes, they're beyond old. ARP spoof was a vulnerability characterized in the 1980s. Sniffing traffic through the same LAN network is as old as dirt itself. It's not even complicated. It's not JUST possible, it's already built upon established evidence followed by tools that make it work, everyday in the field. You're wrong to think they can't trace you. Read up on pentesting tools, you'll find more than you'd've thought. There's more to it than Plasma RAT and LOIC. There's real-life threats which CAN and ARE used to trace data streams to their source vs destination. If anyone can download the Kali pentesting distro with all of these tools built-in for free, imagine what LE has. It's all too real. Please do research...... as for beaver, you're wrong, at least in how you explained your theory - SDR handles software-driven radio frequency. RFID is hardware-driven radio frequency tech. It has nothing to do with the macaddr.  And responding to another person, VPN isn't the best if it's fed-owned or run inside of a server serviced by an ISP that keeps logs. The real IP can also be tracked by mechanisms like CIPAV, which would mean the next time you disconnect your VPN [and think, boot-up, shut-down], which makes it open, even if for a short period of time, to phone the IP address home to DC. Proxies only work if you disable javascript, including Tor. If you're just connecting to an AP or wifi router, you still show off that you're using tor, and that creates a red flag. It won't, of course, in normal circumstances, lead to interception of traffic, since, even tor-tunneled traffic bypasses ARP spoof attacks and blocks any infiltration into the tunnel itself, but if a fed owns the node you happened to be assigned by the client, then they essentially own all your traffic. While that's mostly rare, it's still possible, and does happen. You are, however, very correct with MiTM attacks. Anyone can intercept traffic by issuing a rogue ssl cert to the host being spied upon, it's even easy for anyone with a computer and internet access, just use sslstrip, it's a tool that will intercept ssl traffic through said means. Feds in U.S. did it with google and bing and yahoo, France did with google, Turkey did it for gmail. If you have the cert authorizing you to see all their ssl traffic, not even HTTPS secure connections such as forms with sensitive data is safe, in theory. Funnytrips, macaddr doesn't give anyone a who's whom. It identifies the manufacturer's ID of your NIC card, which, yes, CAN be an incriminating factor, as the rest of a potential investigation pans out and narrows down, but it won't tell who's whom. At most, it'll probably tell you which computer in the neighborhood/household, assuming enough variety in models of NIC cards. and yes I know because I am a grayhat ideologist who studies computer-forensics, malware, backdoors, and methods used, as well as pentesting, etc. I see enough of all of this stuff everyday out there. I know what I'm talking about. I've even used these methods first-hand for testing [think random neighbor kids as test subjects]. I know how they work.

Anyway I can tell you what happens here in w.europe when you go for a DL exchange...You present your foreign DL  to the administration. You may or you may not have to justify *how* you got that DL: basically by having lived for at least 6 months in a foreign country.The clerck does a visual check, without telling you, on the authenticy of your DL.If your DL is deemed genuine, you do all the paperworks to receive a new DL (photocopies, etc) from your ""original"" country.When your new DL is ready, you come back, they take your old one and give you the new ""original"" DL.The administration then sends your old and foreign DL to the issuing country for authentification and destruction. If your ""original country"" doesn't receive any warning, nothing else will happen and you now have a real DL. I have absolutely no idea of how ""foreign countries"" react when they receive DL for destruction. Maybe they don't check, maye they do. --- If your ""original country"" administration has DOUBTS about the authenticity of your foreign DL, they will first send a copy to the original country for authentification BEFORE making you a new one. How that works I don't know.  --- Edit: if you drive in Poland with a UK DL, the cops won't be able to check UK's databases. However they might wonder and you must have something else from the UK to back you up: for exemple a student card. Don't say you exchanged your polish DL into a UK one because your polish DL should be in their system under your name. And since it's fictuous, it won't be

In a first world country I won't name, around 10 years ago, a UK licence was taken at face value when asking for a conversion, provided it looked good. Combined with a fake birth certificate and another ID (neither of which they could verify at that time), you could walk in and walk out same day with a legitimate, in system drivers licence in the name of your choice. Definitely no longer the case.  The closer the agencies are physically, the more likely they are to have a mechanism to check, simply because they see so many of that country's licences. Assuming that your European country would not check with the UK is asking for trouble. The US is a hard one to predict. I knew someone in California a long time ago who had DMV connections, he said when an overseas country physically sent them a licence that they wanted verified and it wasn't in the computer system, it went straight in the trash, as it wasn't their problem and it was too much work. Then again, California being a very populace state, that could've been because they got a lot of such requests. Can you imagine your local roads office trying to write a letter to, say, TN or GA... how often do you think those kinds of places get overseas verification requests? Consider the language difference involved in your local road branch and communicating with their counterpart overseas. Is it worth their time and effort? On the topic of banana islands, ever seen a drivers licence issued in the Cook Islands (off New Zealand)? Look them up on line.

"Evolution Forums","EbayCaution","29060","2014-10-21T17:21:34","A word of caution","Security & Anonymity","Hi guys, Just had a chat with a friend. He found a seller of coins on Ebay, made the payment and the seller asked my friend to give him a call and leave a message on his voicemail. Just to avoid fraudulent accounts.... ( whatever that means ) The voice had to contain buyer's Ebay username and the amount in BTC purchased.  My friend called and left the message.  Also he sent his wallet id to seller.  Then he received another message from  the seller  saying that the wallet is not good.  My friend then sent another wallet id. 2 hours passed and my friend sent a message asking for cancellation.  Seller sent the coins in a few seconds. My friend donated all the coins afterwords. ------------------------- This is a word of caution for everyone, if they get excited to buy BTC from Ebay with whatever they are using to buy. I tend to agree with my friend that says this seller is a high level LEO. I mean he tried to identify the caller + phone # when he asked to be called; he asked for a second wallet ( since he found an IP based inside TOR for the first one) ; he has a perfect feedback with hundreds of transactions, 0 neutral, 0 negative, account hold for years but he has 2014 in his Ebay username. Pretty rare to sign up with an account in 2007 and put 2014 in it. Too good to be true...  I am not sure if it is relevant or not to give here his entire Ebay username. I am not even sure if my friend is not acting crazy but the point is to watch your back. Always. Be safe.  ----- I made this account for this thread only of course and will not abuse it -------",""

It's on forums on Reddit, several posts, There's a couple post on SR2, and now there are several posts on Bitcoin Fogs own forums.  A couple things to consider, Bitcoin Fog has been around the longest and people trust them, but anyone can decide to scam or lose control of their own site easy with all the hacking/phishing going on. There are two known phish sites for the Fog, one is BitcoinFog.com, obvious nonsense there, and another is actually a "".onion"" address that starts as the legit site but then redirects you to a phishing site, so you have to keep an eye on the address at all times. Their customer support has been terrible in responding and I think there is something very wrong over there.  It seems the formula is; people deposit money, try withdrawing, and nothing comes out. Afterwards people have reported trying to log into their account again and being locked out. Then they create a new account, just in order to contact customer service and they will either not reply or reply with, ""we cannot give you info on another account, (which is your account!), or ""try typing your password correctly."" Total bullshit. Personally, I have used the Fog once with no trouble, but now I avoid it like the plague. So anyone that uses it beware. And you don't need to take my word for it, search on SR2 forums, search Reddit, (DNM's, SR2, and few others) and they all say the same, selective scamming and CS doing nothing about it. Oh and you can actually read posts in their own forums where people are bitching about being scammed. So I would avoid, but it's up to you. Just thought I would inform the community. Protect your hard earned money and stay safe friends.

It's the same, except tor is plugged into its proxy config, and with some extra plugins. However, tor browser fails to give proper precautions with even that. I.E., it doesn't disable js or plugins [not in the native config, nor in noscripts], and it could use some work in the area of optimization to keep up with tor's lack of speed.  not a big problem in the least, however, you could be better off in a Linux host, running virtualbox, as MS is known to ""keep track of its users."" The outside host knows everything that goes on, inside the guest OS, however the guest OS has no clue as to the things happening on the outside. True, yes, there are cases, where, of course, crypters provide anti-virtualization functions to detect and bypass VM protection. Are you using virtualbox or VMware? If in virtualbox, it's in the settings of the VM machine, in network. Change, preferrably, to NAT Network or NAT. NAT is with an adapter inside, NAT Network, from my experience, handles the adapter device as being outside of the guest OS. Both cases, it doesn't allow knowledge of the traffic transmitted inside of your VM, to your actual network. Bridged gives everything data-wise to the network, and thus, any intruding espionage, plus as a general rule, it's a bit slower. If you're in VMware, it's, again, in the VM machine config, where you would wanna delete the default given network adapter from when you created the VM machine, and add a NAT adapter. Also try something like vm-tweaker from sourceforge to lessen the knowledge of anything running inside the guest OS of knowing you're, in fact, IN a VM.",""

"Evolution Forums","Frank2013","12912","2014-10-22T23:24:21","Re: Chances of actually getting caught","Security & Anonymity","Hello Everyone. The chances of getting caught depend on several variables.   The most important of course is YOU!. The majority of search warrants are obtained through confidential informants.  LE lacks the requisite resources and intimate knowledge to find carders/dealers/etc.  LE at the local level are more concerned about overt street crime.  Crimes occurring behind closed doors or elsewhere go undetectable for the most part. What happens more often than not is that YOU say something to someone during a moment that you trusted them.  Well, one day that person's arse is on the line and they serve your arse up to save theirs.  Or they become pissed at you for some reason and dime you out.  So you know who keeps your secrets best? You do! Keep you mouth closed about what you do (trust no one, not even your mother) and that big variable is reduced to zero. Second, in terms of value for prosecution. In reality there really is no threshold.  Yes, the Feds normally won't go prying into a case unless it's $50,000 or more (carding related).  That's because the AUSA (Assistan US Attorney) doesn't want to be bothered with prosecuting lower amounts.  This does not mean that you're safe from the Feds if you're under $50,000.  The Feds have a tendency of passing off cases that the AUSA won't prosecute. They pass them off to local LE that they have a working relationship with and local LE is often happy to take the arrest since it's usually gift wrapped by the Feds. The local prosecutor's office is a mill and another case involving a carder who ran up $5,000 is no big deal for them.  Third, there's just dumb luck.  How often have you read in the papers about some poor bloke doing something as silly as making a turn against a traffic light or passing a stop sign.  LE pulls him over and find 20 million pounds of cannabis in the front seat of his car (just exaggerating of course, but you get the point).  There's always the chance that LE can stumble upon you by just dumb luck on their part.  That thankfully, doesn't happen very often and the only way to prevent that is to keep whatever you do well isolated and not bring unnecessary attention anywhere near you.  A great book titled ""How to be Invisible"" by JJ Luna lends some good advice. It's a free e-book on the clear net.  In substance, keep your head down and don't attract any sort of attention.  Dress, act and behave like the majority of sheeps that you are around and you'll avoid inquiries.  Lastly, there's the IT component (VPN, WHONIX, TAILS, etc.). The type of 'work' I do/did did not involve computers.I'm a complete retarded when it comes to that part. I'm interested in switching professions and came here to learn so I can't give you advice in regards to that realm.  But I've read a lot here so far and there seems to be some very knowledgeable members that are welcoming and helpful.   I hope that the little that I shared will be helpful.",""

It can be worthwhile if you are paranoid and being extra-safe, however it could, in theory, be considered, by some accounts, overkill.",""

"Evolution Forums","maltivera","26623","2014-10-03T01:08:42","Re: more VPN shit","Security & Anonymity","some cases, it's not better. In U.S. it's not illegal to use Tor. Heck, in some areas, it's well-known, documented, and known, but no one cares. My ISP doesn't keep [long-term & monitored] logs, nor does it censor. Torrents perfectly accessible, so is malware of all sorts, no DPI. Heck, I'm not a pedo but if I wanted to access it, I would very capable of doing so without the need to bypass. I use my own DNS, no locking of box. It's more likely for the gov to backdoor THEIR communications and thus MINE, than it is for ISP to care if I use Tor, let alone wanna find out. However, tor causes problems with, let's say you wanna card, since many block tor in htaccess or iptables, etc. If you get a VPN that TRULY doesn't log, then there's no issue to need to torify INTO the vpn, but on the other hand, what about their ISP? Also a prime example of vpn going multiple servers is doublevpn which also has a quadvpn edition, etc. If your VPN keeps logs and doesn't jump servers, then while your ISP knows you're using tor, they don't know which VPN you're using, the VPN doesn't know your real IP, and you can still do financial-related jobs without being blocked as suspicious, since, by the way, tor is easily flagged. However, your VPN couldn't care less about you torifying your connection to it, and VPN, depending on the service and how misused or not misused it is, could and also could not put up flags in financial forms -  which is why you get a private VPN or set up your own VPS proxy server gateway.  it's not a concrete science, but use common sense when choosing a vpn. It's not hard, either. You don't use free ones, and you don't use EU or North American servers, etc....you use one you can pay for with btc, ltc, wmz, or perfectmoney, etc. You use one that doesn't overcompensate itself as crime-friendly, and one that has its website hosted somewhere in Eurasia or Asia (i.e., Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Romania, Latvia, Russia, China, North Korea), or a place like Belize, Panama, or Costa Rica. VPNs CAN be trusted, it's not that they can't; it's a matter of picking a SERIOUSLY LEGITIMATE provider.

I was however looking into some different vpns but when thinking in the cost of using one for a set amount of days before having to update it or get a new one, I didnât like the figures I was coming up with. I know of course that it would most defiantly be a regret if anything were to get linked back to me. But I have heard from a few different people that have been on these markets for a while that they havenât had any problems as long as they keep an eye out for scam/LE. They say the same thing about the whole mixing coins; they havenât ever done it and made over 100 buys or more by now without any problems from local bitcoins or coin base at all. I really do like what I hear about vpns though with all that extra security and whatnot, it would put a whole more confidence in my shopping but supply my funds with lower increments of coin to spend.

Whether or not you, yes, would be using another person's computer, imagine if they keep logs which they probably do. Even with socks, you're essentially now transmitting all the data over their system - now, their ISP sees it.You can be backtracked. If it's your computer, you're presumably running tor on it, so even if your ISP sees tor, they can't know what you're doing. On your own computer, you control the logs - on an RDP you don't. You're not probably going to install tor on that remote system, but simple procedures to backtrack a connection, even with socks, can leave you in the murky waters. You're better off using tor+vpn (with a good  Russian-BP-host vpn) on your own live-boot system. RDPs are overrated and much an unnecessary pain. Tor is underrated and well-worth it. If you wanna blame the arrests on pedos using tor, don't blame tor -> it was the fact they left js enabled and feds had CIPAV. It was a firefox vulnerability, not tor's vulnerability. That is to say, tor is without much flaw, as long as you know how to use it. RDP can be good but you never have a clearcut way of knowing when it is and when it's not - in the end, it's better practice to leave yourself out of it.

Having one more tunnel isn't 100% always a good thing - if it's a matter of going or not going through yet one more system that may or may not keep logs, I'd rather not use that extra step of protection, because at least I know what logs are or are not being kept on my own systems. Think quality of protection, not quantity. You don't want the most tunnels if the tunnels provide a weakness point for LE to take advantage of and retrieve sensitive data. Don't go for 4 tunnels which are probably keeping logs, if you can have 3 tunnels alone which you know for a fact are NOT keeping logs. Quantity of layers isn't quality. If it's a system where it's being logged, it can be used against you. That means, even if they can't backtrack to your actual system, they have all the logs of every trick you've used and the data used for the transaction. They have your vpn and can arrest the node operator. If you connect to the site via a non-honeypot VPN in russia, through tor, they know your VPN, but they first of all, can't warrant it for data, and 2nd of all, even if they do, they can't know your real IP address. While you have one less layer, it's also one less problematic liability. Liability is the most important factor. Using more layers you don't know enough about creates a risk factor potential. That can be more dangerous than one less layer of protection. As for appearing as from the victim whose CC you are using, you can simply run your own botnet and host reverse proxies on those hosts. VIP72 is basically the same as hacked RDPs with regards to liability. They're simply reverse proxied host victims of a botnet, sold to the provider. You're getting the same thing from PUBLIC socks providers, the only difference being one is free and one is not. Simply being paid-for doesn't make it any more reliable, as they are still hosts logging data, hence another point of weakness in your defensive lines, and thus, another liability factor. I don't card, I am an enthusiast in cybersec. I have field experience though. and even if I did card,since when did I suggest not using tor or vpn. tor+vpn is ESSENTIAL. rdp is not, however. I ALWAYS use vpn, and even when I don't, I use tor for risky biz. Doing anything risky without it is a clear no-no. My problem isn't against vpns or tor, but whether or not you use a legit vpn provider, and whether the tor nodes are hosted in EU or North American countries. You can blacklist them in the torrc, and the point of using unlisted bridges. CCs are easily harvested via botnets such as Citadel, why pay for them, when all you could need is a monthly fee and multiple C&Cs, test subjects, and arguably a crypter? And furthermore, why in the world would anyone card in-person...that's a clearly-cut way to get caught. It's much less-risky to do it through cyber-communications, but even less risky to sell the data you harvest, than using it yourself. Besides, buying for yourself is to be extremely discouraged, as the point is to buy it for cheap then re-sell it so it can't be traced its its new monetary form, i.e., on underground markets such as this one.Question, what size is your wordlist? Small wordlists make for easy but unreliable RDPs with passwords like ""password."" I use wordlists combined from individual ones of anywhere from 1gb to over 200 gb, making for ginormous wordlists. I also mangle it in Kali, and include up to 20 characters, alphanumerical as well as unicode characters. A pain as far as how long it takes, but much more effective.

"Evolution Forums","fruitful","22772","2014-09-26T22:41:56","Re: just so u know and be safe!","Security & Anonymity","I'm pretty sure they can find the owner of the VPN server and locate the company that bought the VPN server then it comes down to how much trust you put into the provider, some say they don't log you and some say they don't and they actually don't log your activity or your actual IP address. The NSA are going to have a difficult time finding someone who's connected to VPN that genuinely doesn't have logs on anyone then again, pretty sure it would only take the NSA to breach the company that owns the VPN services and track people from there ie their incoming address and their simulated address. So best advice would be to find a good VPN provider more than anything else. Sure you can just buy VPN from any old VPN provider but are you really getting the benefits of anonymity and security? Find a VPN that uses OpenVPN over PPTP and L2TP/IPSec. PPTP uses RSA RC4 encryption when using Microsoft's Point-to-Point Encryption protocol (MPPE) but the security of this is devastatingly poor, dictionary attacks, bit-flipping etc. , this method is deemed flawed as is L2TP/IPSec but many internet security experts will argue the case that IPSec is pretty damn secure and in fact AES-256 which is the encryption standard for IPSec is what NSA deem 'approved' for top-secret information, whether you want to beleive them or not is upto you, perhaps they say it because they've broke it? Who knows. Your not really safe unless your using OpenVPN which uses SSL/TLS as standard and doesn't really have any vulnerabilities to date. OpenVPN uses a plethora of encryption standards; AES, Blowfish, 3DES, RC5 for example. This is implemented with 256bit AES encryption, considered the standard for confidentiality.  That being said, OpenVPN is really the standard for VPN use nowadays, for now at least... Make sure your VPN provider uses software that utilizes OpenVPN and not crappy PPTP otherwise you might as well stand outside the NSA buildings and get a huge fucking projector and show them what you are doing. L2TP/IPSec should be avoided because OpenVPN surpasses, not that it's insecure compared to PPTP but it's not as good as OpenVPN. Also like mentioned before, make sure that your VPN provider DOES NOT record logs which will include your IP address, websites visited, time used etc. Some will lie to you, but those that genuinely don't log will definitely annoy the NSA or any other authority. If they do log, all it takes is a nice threatening email from the government and they open their doors to whatever information those bastards want. Just remember, no-one is going to go to prison for you, no-one. You are just a VPN subscriber, they are here to make money as much as provide a genuine service and they won't bat an eyelid when it comes to them going to prison for perverting the course of justice by not providing evidence.

For a long time it was just dropping revocations,subkey updates and expirations on the floor. That is *really*bad. Eventually, they upgraded their keyserver software, but it is*still* running an older version of SKS, a version that fails to handle16-digit subkeyid lookups (among other failings). So, please don't rely on pgp.mit.edu for your security, and please don'tinclude them in your slides! If you are looking for one to use, I highlyrecommend using the SKS pool address (hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net orhttp://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/ - or if you want a more closegeographical pool, have a look athttp://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php).

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","15845","2014-07-07T06:30:45","Re: Need help/advice!","Security & Anonymity","well i did some quick research and it's a simple command line on a linux box, serveror workstation. when you get to pc's it is a bit more complicated. it is normally a feature that is disabled on servers - which would be on the web server. either yahoo or aol you can't ping cuz they block it, i can never remember which one is which. i think what the JavaScript exploit does is cause your box to send a icmp ping packet to the LE box and then they can see the IP where it came from. to complicate matters even more you have firewalls (both software and router) and, in my case anyway, normally a VPN tunnel sitting between the box and TOR. so consider the case first of an exploit like that one that was in firefox 17 browser. so the JavaScript sends a command from LE box (or modified html page) to your box - back through TOR and then back to the VPN and then back to your box and a ping packet is sent back to the LE box. Now i need to do testing to see whether the return shows your actual IP or the IP of the VPN. either way - if there is a persistent analyst on the other end and it shows the VPN they can probably trace it back to you eventually. so probably the solution is to disable ping from your PC. i doubt that you can turn off ping on the VPN but maybe you can on some. obviously the easiest solution to prevent your machine from sending a ping is to simply rename the ping.exe file to something like ping.old. (there may be more than one copy in the path that need to be renamed as well) that way if your PC receives a request to send a ping, it will be unable to do so. Of course this simply disables one way that an adversary can obtain your IP address. there may well be other JavaScript methods for requesting your IP that i don't know about. i can code JavaScript as needed and i have pretty much experience with jquery libraries but i am by no means an expert at JavaScript. as to the other way around - stopping your PC from responding to a ping is whole different animal. all the applicable sample code that i found was for writing a ping client to be included in your application. Basically it involves writing a custom Ping API - which obviously will have a number of routines like a .dll - and it is entirely possible that in that API code ping can be disabled as well as enabled - meaning your machine would then ignore ICMP ping requests - making it invisible on the web or least protect it from widespread automated scans looking for boxes to exploit. might be a real useful thing for people that are still running XP and don't want to pick up any malware.  if i can't disable it completely - i may be able to spoof the ip address that it returns. i will look into it tomorrow. i can also check to see if Python can do it, since it was ported from Linux to windows it may be easier in Python than using windows type code. why does shit that looks easy always get complicated.....",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","15845","2014-07-07T18:09:28","Re: Need help/advice!","Security & Anonymity","well i use whonix as well for certain tasks. it has 2 components a gateway and a client. it is not designed to run on top of tails. however, whonix forces all traffic through TOR so you can't accidentally log in somewhere on clear web without TOR (which of course could expose your identity).  the gateway can also be configured as an additional firewall. also you install Whonix on your same USB stick as Tails and depending on your needs at the moment, you can choose to boot from Tails, or boot into your normal OS and fire up whonix. it will give you the same degree of anon as Tails. and it won't leave any traces either. i would recommend downloading and reading all of the DOCs on whonix. they are very interesting. For example it can't reveal its underlying IP because every Whonix gateway uses the same IP. personally i use a VPN to prevent the nosy ISP from logging my TOR activity (all they could see without the VPN is that TOR is running - not where you go on TOR - but with the VPN all they can see is the VPN) Also with whonix you need a virtual machine to intstall it in and then you can configure multiple VMs - say one for Kali if you want try your hacking at some hacking or stealing wifi passwords). Oracle makes a VM that is super easy to install - download it and accept all the defaults. you take snapshots of your VMs so they can restored in the event of some mischief finding its way in. also you can establish a persistent volume on there to save downloads. with out they will disappear when you log out. of course everybody says to encrypt your USB stick with TruCrypt (don't use version 8) i don't do carding so i am not up on the latest tricks, but i believe a lot of people gain access to a target computer through RDP then they login from there so JS isn't an issue since they are running on the target machine. actually i got sidetracked (easy for me to do - happens all the time) from your original issue. i am not as afraid of JavaScript as some people are. of course i would never run it on a sensitive site that requires the use of a browser. Crawling a site or scraping a site or hacking a site - JS isn't really an issue. Well it could come into play on scrapers but i am only going to innocuous sites like Baseball Prospectus or ESPN sports, depending on what i am after. i am still going to figure out a way to ignore ping requests. I guess it is a function of certain routers as well. i was reading one doc from micro$oft that says print and file sharing are inextricably linked to the ability to repel pings in Windows Vista (and above). apparently there is a check box in the TCP protocol client but by disabling one disables all 3 and vice versa. of course if you don't have a networked printer of shared folders, then it's not an issue to disable in there. but i will write a small footprint standalone routine that runs on startup as a service that rejects ping requests, because i have a bunch of XP laptops (heavy duty boxes - you can throw them across the room) that have to run XP tablet edition (most people have never heard of it) but because the hardware is designed around it, i can't upgrade to WIN7. i could run Linux cuz it will run on anything - even a 286 - but of course TOR, etc. are 32 bit apps. i have run across some TOR services sites that are 64 bit but are mostly backwardly compatible (e.g. Safe-mail.net - you can login and read mail but you can't reply on 32 bit machine)",""

As i discussed above i am pro VPN because they make your computer invisible (at least my provider AVG does) because they are unpingable. i would think you need to use a proxy to make it appear that you are in the proper geographic area rather than a naked TOR exit node (which your target site my or may not have on its blacklist). then just enable JS and go ahead. also if you want to save downloaded info onto your USB stick you will need to create a persistent volume otherwise anything that you download or otherwise try to save will disappear when you shut down your computer.

If you wish to order from an international vendor, keep in mind that some counties have harder customs than others. Do your research on your countries customs before you place an order to find out how tough it is to pass customs in your country.

With that I mean anything thats on paper, LSD ; NBOMe etc..Because speed paste and all kind of this shit seems to gets ""lost"" or caught by the LE. Ofcourse this depends how experienced or retarded the vendors are who pack it, and bla bla, but the main thing is to make money and this shit will get harder and harder every day, and even with the ""popular vendors"". Anyway, recently discovered NBOMe, and I must say that I have only positive things to say - very cheap, hard hitting, and very easily saleable - as 99% people never heard of darknet, and most likely never will hear about evolution or any other market either, this seems to be the most profitable drug right now in the market. Little calculation - buy from here x500 (about 0,17â¬ piece) witch will cost only 85â¬ - And you will sell them on the streets, 10â¬ a piece - 5000â¬ profitNow I will bring back the question, are these kind of drugs safer to ship or not?",""
"Evolution Forums","themostseekrit","26610","2014-10-01T22:56:22","Re: Safest drugs to send ?","Security & Anonymity","Anything you can lay on paper is going to be your safest bet, but smaller amounts of any powder you should also be able to bag up, seal, and fit nicely in a standard plain envelope (the best way to ship things). NBOMe is commonly discussed. I'm a fan since it's so cheap (especially if you buy raw powder from China and lay blotter yourself), and it's a pretty fun drug. You can buy it on the darknet and easily sell on the streets for 10x the price. The problem is when people sell it saying it is LSD. Here's a bit of a reply I left on another post that was discussing selling NBOMe as LSD:","themostseekrit wrote:Inexperienced people will probably not be able to notice a difference, and since so much ""acid"" on the streets is NBOMe anyways, a lot of people probably don't even know what LSD feels like. However, if you sell NBOMe as LSD, I think you deserve to die. NBOMe's safety profile is nowhere near that of LSD's, and NBOMe has killed a lot of people. Most issues arise when a user believes it is LSD and doses higher, but since NBOMe has a much steeper dose-response curve, they overdose (which is not fun, assuming you survive).On the flipside, when people take NBOMe and know what they are taking, they generally have a good trip. NBOMe is a pretty fun chemical, and it's dirt cheap. You can buy 100x 1 mg tabs for like $50 on the darknet (or buy more and save even more, I got a gram for $130), and a single tab is more than plenty (whereas with LSD in order to get a proper trip you may need to take two or three). If you tell people it's NBOMe, tell them not to take more than one, most of them will not mind that much. You can sell the tabs for $5 apiece or so: $5 for a solid trip if a great deal, and you'd still turn a hefty profit."

Those who knowingly take NBOMe and are well-informed about it tend to have pretty fun trips. Calling any drug ""chinese bullshit"" is rather harsh and ignorant, and I wouldn't be surprised if you've never even taken it before. Oh also, where are you paying $4/tab for decent acid? That's a pretty damn good price and more commonly you'd be paying $10 or even $15 (retarded, I know), at least here, and that's assuming you can even find real LSD. P.S. Anything could potentially kill you. The LSD could trigger some underlying schizophrenia, shatter your mind, etc. and drive you to kill yourself. Or you could get struck by lightning while tripping and die from that. The risk associated with responsibly consuming NBOMe is severely exaggerated.","homersimpson wrote:nbome sellers should be beat down. yes the shit is dirt cheap, but  so is acid when you have a good hook, id much rather pay $4 for a tab of acid and KNOW that it wont potentially kill me than to pay 10 cents for some chinese bullshit RC"

""But if you really think that , under whonix , is more risky to do Tor > Vpn , than Vpn Tor  , feel free to let me know why , or give me a link to documentation (I don't wanna waste your time in writing a big guide)"" You're confusing situations. It's a false problem when people ask ""Should it be vpn to tor or tor to vpn?"" There are different use cases. If you are connecting to a hidden service, then obviously the end connection must be through Tor (in which case, one should use a VPN before Tor, chained how many times you like). But in connecting to clearnet, then yes it's very useful to have a VPN be the end connection which doesn't know you're IP address (because again, this is a different situation then if connecting to a hidden service, where obviously the VPN before Tor knows your IP address, although this isn't bad because your ISP knows your IP address before Tor anyway).  All in all, this whole campaign against VPN to Tor is shrouded in ignorance and only championed by those who heard it said by OTHER people, but who don't really know much themselves.  Also, even though Whonix is completely IRRELEVANT to this discussion, I do support and vouch for Whonix.",""

Now you load TOR on there to protect the IP address of the VPN. there are other benefits to this as well. most VPNs claim they don't log anything (except error msgs from the webserver). whether they do or not is of no concern because all you are doing is browsing the forum - and even if they are logging all the logs will show is that you fired up TOR. you can also use VPN for surfing clearweb which really fucks up the adware analysis crap. i get real tickled now that when i go clearweb with VPN i get side panel ads from the other coast. so just fucking up their demographic stuff is satisfying in itself. also a big advantage of VPN is that it does not respond to ICMF ping requests, and therefore (unless you are connected to a web page or something, your PC is basically invisible, rendering it safe from drive by attacks by automated scanners - because they don't see it). this is a nice feature if you are still running XP. there is no downside because all you are doing is browsing this forum. now let's assume you are up to some nefarious activity. don't use VPN at all, because if it if ever gets exposed a persistent adversary can find you. but of course since you aren't at home, you may think this is not an issue. but it is still so because it is probably getting logged somewhere where you are connected and you might be on candid camera at that date and time, it which case there may be be an actual photographic record of your activity - so dress nicely.anyway i said i don't use wireless, the reason is it is plain old radio and anybody who wants to can listen. if you hook on to your next door neighbors wireless - how hard is to figure that out? it reminds me of a time back in early 70's when the prevailing attitude was still anti-phone company, so phone company hacks were common as were what was then known as swinging singles apartment complexes. at that time when they built these things they just snaked a cable with a couple hundred sets of twisted pair cables throughout the building. well we popped open the wall box and tapped into one of these pairs and hooked up a boot leg phone. of course if we were talking and the real user picked up we just hung up real quick. well we got away with it for about 6 months until we got a knock on the door by two telephone fraud investigators. they had badges, but worked for AT&T or whoever it was. turned out that was our bad luck to tap into the line of the apartment above us, and this just happened to be where these 2 guys lived. well we didn't get arrested - they just told us not to do it any more. we hadn't run up any toll charges (that's where they charge you for long distance calls - for you young guys that have never heard a dial tone) so there was no real damage. anyway i don't like wireless. LE has a device now called a stingray that will collect all wireless traffic within a half mile radius - obviously they can't get a warrant for this as the 4th amendment requires probable cause for a warrant to issue and it must describe in detail the place, thing, etc. to be searched. obviously a device that captures all traffic cannot describe a particular place. if that isn't bad enough LE has to sign a non-disclosure with the manufacturer (i think it is Harris) that prevents them from even revealing that they bought this thing. and this doesn't even include script kiddies sniffing radio traffic or having it accidentally bleed into someone else's session. if i need security i go to a truckstop - i have 6-7 choices - that has rj45 wired jacks. i disable the onboard NICs and use a throwaway (i guess the proper term is burner) USB hard wire NIC.  i then run a VM with Whonix (which forces all traffic through TOR) or sometimes just a tails disc. i never fuck with the socks5 proxies because i don't need them for the things i do. truckstops get so much traffic and it is all itinerant so it is extremely difficult to identify who and and where might have used a certain connection. but take the advice of one my old marine buddies - he said he used to belong to Cowards Anonymous until he got too well known. luckily i have such a drab appearance that people don't remember me easily.    p.s. this damned photo recognition software spread is getting downright scary. i see where they grabbed another fugitive in Nepal after 14 years by matching his passport photo to FBI wanted poster. actually they were just testing the software and using FBI wanted posters for the test. but they got a guy down in FLA a couple weeks ago where they matched his 1980 photo to his FLA drivers license pic in another name. i guess the only solution is to use photo shop to alter passport photo enough to defeat the software.  also read an article yesterday where they said LE now has a technology to have your browser draw a picture, and that is the same as a fingerprint because each browser draws it differently, so they can identify your computer. i am not too sure how that works, but that is what it said.

""logs""Why does it matter if a VPN keeps logs? Because you don't use it properly. Tor through VPN == jailVPN through Tor == profit A VPN does not provide anonymity. Tor does that (and only Tor). You need that crap of $5/month VPN (no matter which) only to avoid that evil Tor exit nodes sniff on your traffic (they will see just your encrypted VPN stream) and to hide to the visited clearnet sites that you do use Tor (for those loser sites which deny access for traffic which comes from any Tor exit node). Therefore ""VPN through Tor"" means Tor exit nodes can't sniff your traffic and VPN provider can't see you real IP (you come from Tor exit node!) and doesn't know your real identity (if you pay in BTC). It's therefore irrelevant if the VPN keeps logs or not. The logs link just to your pseudonym, not your real identity. Tor protects you, not any VPN. And it's Tor which protects this site, not some crap of VPN that always has to comply with national laws and international treaties. Encryption protects you, not the false promise of a VPN provider (subpoena).

Nevertheless, I sure like to read intelligent conversations of this kind. There is always something one can pick up, or something I see that I do not understand but should know more about, so I go back to the school bench and put in a couple of hours to research. @ torrican - thx, I thought that VM->Tor->VPN->SOCKS was what you were talking about, but had to ask since I have read lots of conversations where no one seems to be able to argue upon if Tor->VPN is best, or if VPN->Tor is best. The only argument for VPN->Tor that I have heard so far is that using Tor could alert your ISP about potential illegal activites. But so can the use of a VPN in many places, so the argument is invalid in my opinion. What I wonder, though, is if the VPN provider is able to see anything else than you connecting to a Tor entry node? Will it also be able to see you connecting to an exit node, and then to a SOCKS and then to the site you are carding? If so, the VPN first setup is completely moronic, but I thought that all Tor connections were encrypted (bear with my ignorance here, please)? When speaking of a VM which would torify all connections, I hear Whonix in my mind, but perhaps you are thinking about something else? Sounds almost like you are talking about using a kind of Whonix gateway - but perhaps a whole different OS - and then fire up other VMs which you route through the torifying gateway much like the Whonix Workstation is routed throught the Whonix Gateway. Am I completely off base here? Any idea if I could wine vip72-software in Whonix, btw? If it can be wined at all, it has to be possible in Whonix too, I reason. And with a VPN connection enabled in Whonix, I suppose that we have a VM->Tor->VPN setup. So it would only be a matter of adding vip72 on top of that to come out where we want, right? @ popadoppalus - do you want to get a room with me? I was thinking with clothes on, a couple of laptops and lots of times for mentoring. But I understand if it sounds like a weird suggestion.

I would never run Fedora, Bodhi, Debian, Mint or anything else of the kind while attempting to card. It stands out extremely much. Even Ubuntu is too uncommon compared to Windows. But I do not see the same issues with Whonix, perhaps because of a lack of information, or perhaps because a lot of effort has been put into this particular OS which sets it apart from most GNU/Linux distros. I am running Whonix now - off a GNU/Linux host, ofc - and a check at thismachine.info gives the following info: You appear to be using Firefox 24.0.You appear to be using Windows 7 And when I do a similar check at detectmybrowser.com I get the following result: You're using Firefox version 24 on Windows whatismybrowser.com give me this info: Your web browser is: Firefox 24 on Windows 7 I believe that these are pretty simple tests based on javascript (flash is not installed in my VM and lets not even talk about Java).

You have described TOR over VPN. We recommend VPN over TOR, so that we can't see your real IP address and the TOR nodes see encrypted OpenVPN traffic. The correct path of your config is:PC (OpenVPN with proxy) -> TOR entry -> TOR exit -> VPN server -> SSH server There should be no need to torify anything. Every application should transparently use VPN over TOR (thanks to OpenVPN proxy features). Furthermore, UDP traffic now can go through TOR (it's TCP over UDP, done by OpenVPN)! In this way: - SSH server sees VPN server exit-IP address- VPN server sees TOR exit node IP address- VPN server sees SSH encrypted traffic- TOR servers see OpenVPN+SSH encrypted traffic The packets which finally go out have the SSH server IP address on their header. So please note that if the SSH server is owned by you and you have given your real identity to rent or house it, you might destroy completely the anonymity layer.

I have one package solution for you, although it might not be the best: 1. Install VirtualBox and Whonix-Gateway. 2. Install Windows on another VM, or whatever guest OS you will use for carding. 3. Configure the Windows (i.e. carding) VM to route its traffic via the Whonix-Gateway, instead of via the host OS. 4. Start Whonix-Gateway. Make sure that it works properly and  is updated (sudo apt-get update, if I remember correctly). 5. Start the carding VM. Make sure that you have internet access and that you pass the torcheck with your regular browsers (that is, you do not download Tor Browser Bundle or anything else, your standard Chrome, Firefox or IE should already be torified since all the traffic leaving the carding VM passes through the Whonix-Gateway which in turn only let Tor connections pass to the host OS and further on to the Internet). 6. Install your VPN of choice and log on. You should see that you no longer come out from a Tor exit node, but from your VPN provider's server. 7. Install VIP and connect to the SOCKS you want.

VPN's do nothing but bottleneck traffic to one source you must trust entirely with nothing but promises on a webpage. they have been proven time and time again in high profile cases to do little to nothing to protect the user yet people still come on here and talk about it.

"Evolution Forums","Millz","9212","2014-05-06T15:34:13","Re: MAY have found THE best VPN providors","Security & Anonymity","Hmmm, been reading the comments and I have to disagree on a few levels. Personally, to be SAFER I believe tor>vpn would be better, but it's really not safer than vpn>tor because the same forensics can be done, may be a lil easier this way because if they did trace tor nodes to the originating tor node, then it would show vpn and you know the rest. Also, you guys are going outside the scope of tor. You have to take note on wat nodes you're using AND the difficulty AND time it would take to trace/subpeona these nodes. For example, you may connect to 3 different nodes in 3 different countries. There's a way to change the nodes you connect to so if u wanna use a non-friendly country as exit nodes or watever it's possible. Also, vpn is for privacy, tor is for anonymity. Hence the reason you use them both in combination. In theory, vpn>tor>vpn>tor>socks would be best. In vpn from host>vm>tor>vpn in vm>socks. With whonix you can achieve this because whonix routes every connection thru tor. So if it's connecting to the vpn thru tor, then you should be good. Seeing as it would be a situation such as your original ip will be displayed to vpn 1 but since you're connecting to vpn2 via tor, vpn 1 would only know it's sending it's information thru the tor network, not it's end point. Also all this information would be encrypted thru vpn, then tor. Vpn 2 would know wat you're up to but not who you are because you're connected from tor, so you look like a tor user, not the vpn user. So it's safe to say vpn 1 would be used strictly for privacy and vpn 2 would be used strictly for anonymity. Correct me if I'm wrong, please I love keeping opsec up to par.",""

VPN's require you to trust one specific (usually unknown) party. / Tor asks you to trust nobody.VPN's are privacy by policy. / Tor is privacy by design.VPN's can turn over data. / Tor has nothing to turn over.VPN's may ""not log any data"" and feign ignorance but their ISP ultimately does log even if they don't. Ross Ulbricht anybody? he used a VPN to connect to his SR server and admin it directly. if you read the court documents when they seized the VPN server (like they will yours) they noted how the server was wiped clean and there was nothing on it. however they just needed to view connection logs from the host and it was game over. if any of you think these people who are running VPN services will defend you when government orders hold them liable for actions you commited on their $10/month services you are in for a rude awakening. how did the people of old carding forums get arrested way back when? they got convinced to use VPN services from an LE who gained reputation on the forum. if you run a VPN in conjunction with Tor you have probably done nothing to aid your anonymity. you've merely bottlenecked all of your traffic before you enter the Tor network to a company with flashy webpages and big promises. if you did it after, you now have a permanent exit node whom you bottleneck all of your traffic through. sad to say history is doomed to repeat itself, but that falls on the resposibility of the individual.p.s. keep shouting out what VPN providers you use, I am sure LE would love to know which services may be hosting users of the most interest to them."

While I agree that going through TOR first is the best course of action, I wouldn't want the IP of a VPN provider to be linked to the sites I am browsing on the darknet.  VPN is a necessity ONLY for the fact to escape the recent attacks on TOR (though the concept has been known) on controlling the ENTRY relays and EXIT relays. (Using a VPN first has its advantages though -  even if someone controlled the ENTRY and EXIT relay they would only see the VPN IP and not your own.) That being said, if you go through TOR > VPN > TOR then you increase your protection exponentially as it is not likely (but still possible) that all 4 entry/exit relays used would be compromised. Even if the first 2 nodes from the first TOR connection were compromised all they would see is the encrypted VPN traffic (though they would still have identifying data about you), if the second set of entry/exit relays were compromised as well it would still be okay because all they would see is the VPN identity data along with encrypted traffic from the VPN. The reason I like this setup is because  1) You are not placing all of your trust in a VPN provider by blindly giving them your Real IP (Though, going through VPN first would prevent your identity from being compromised if the first set of TOR exit/entry relays have been compromised - I would take my chances with TOR before trusting a VPN provider) 2) You are adding a second layer of encryption that protects you from the tor exit/entry relay vulnerability and using another service completely separate from TOR to add a level of security (VPN) 3) You are routing your VPN traffic through TOR again. This prevents the VPN host from seeing where you have been browsing (in the event that for some reason they disable your VPN's encryption and spy on your traffic and have your IP address / browsing data from the first Entry/Exit Nodes if compromised) because you are going through another encrypted service (TOR) so all they would be able to see (even with VPN encryption disabled) would be the encrypted TOR information from the second pass through.  4) You are exponentially increasing your security, and decreasing the chance that all of your Exit/Entry relays are compromised.",""

I've seen lots of posts by noobs asking about raids, warrants, what the LE do and what they search, so I'll help you guys out here. This is a general short guide for this, but I might add more or if anyone has information, I'll probably add that to it. This is mostly based on western raids. But you'd think that most LE everywhere use most of these tactics. I've already shared all of this info many times before. But now I'm just going to post it here so I don't have to repeat myself and to help noobies.  LE are not entirely stupid. When they have the warrant for the raid, they have everything prepared and know what to look for. They've obtained a floor plan for your building already, had detective(s) watch you or the building over time, and they have good reason to believe there is some bad activity in there. They will have researched all escape routes you could possibly take and will have them blocked off as they move towards your building, so you can't run away. They will search your walls, floor, vents, roof, and food packages. Before, during, or after they may ask your neighbors things about you and phish for any information they can get. They most likely won't dig around your yard, unless it looks like you've dug up somewhere there before. They may or may not use dogs. Usually, they'd had to have found at least 1 illegal thing such as drugs or bombs before they'd do that. If they do, then there is nowhere that you can hide those items anywhere on the property without the dogs finding it or people.  If they find even one thing illegal there/suspicious, they will do the whole 9 yards in the search procedure. Your car is covered in the search warrant as well. Doesn't matter if they destroy shit. If you don't have anything bad, they will cover it, but it will take a longgggggg time to get refunded for what THEY say the item is worth. If you did have something bad, lol then they will see it as the raid was justified and they don't have to pay for shit because fuck you. They will not fix things before they leave. They will leave your windows broken and your door bashed off the hinges, wide open and you will be sitting there at 5am angry that you were too lazy and high to secure your OPS. The scope of the warrant lets them re-raid you over and over at any point after they've raided you too and it even extends to the future residents of that building. You should move if that happens. You basically have aids. Another trick they do is they tell you that you have to look down at the ground at all times as far as your eyes will go down, like at your own body (yes, for the entire time they are there [hours and hours]). If you fail to do this, they say that you were disobeying officers and then they'll have an excuse to arrest (process) you. Once you are processed, it's over. They have your fingerprints in the database and you would have to be pretty retarded to go back to this line of work. Again, if you've ever been arrested; you should not be on the deepweb. Being processed even once = 10000x easier to catch you in the future for anything. A lot of people see it as they would kill themselves in this event if they possibly can before they reach them. And for those people, I'll tell you one thing you could do that they won't be prepared for. You could set up traps just in case this kind of thing happens. Because LE are NOT prepared for that kind of thing. That's rare and you'd kill a bunch of them if you had traps at the exits and all around. At least you could kill some before you killed yourself to evade capture. So you have to think about these things when you are preparing your OPsec and counter them. This is how you never get caught and be a pro 360 no scoper  And remember kids, to keep the feds mad !",""

A lot of people take LE for fools, and yeah, some of them probably are but it's nothing new having all the escape routes blocked, the typical ""Hey, he's trying to bail out of the window, everybody over here!"" and if you have committed serious offenses then I'd presume they have a layout of your building but you aren't talking buying a few eighths of pot here and there, you are talking BIG TIME stuff. Then again, it's not hard to evade them if you know what you are doing, best off not being in a location they know you for, if you've got previous then move from that address, move somewhere else, never spend too much time in the house, if they never see you leave then they are always going to know someone is in at all times. CCTV is a good idea, the same car pulling up down the street is definitely ringing alarm bells, notice different cars that your neighbors don't drive and the friends and family they have don't drive, if your area is a 'safe' zone and you don't get much police attention, know something is definitely wrong when they start patrolling the area. Don't use your bank account, use cash, ATM transactions, store transactions can easily be logged, making the mistake of paying for a hotel on your card = FUCKED. Don't let everyone know where you are all of the time, only those you really trust like your wife, girlfriend, brother etc. The more mysterious you are, the less chance your friends/family can rat you out. People make the mistake of bailing themselves out to their family homes, only for their family to be asked where is he staying now and for them to give an honest answer. I think it's should be mandatory for anyone to have this down as simple 'planning' more than anything else. Look at those that go out shooting up people and go on the run for weeks if not months if not longer, they didn't just watch the Rambo series, they relived every possibility in their head twice over, read books, read facts, knew their enemy, knew their weaknesses and look, they play them for a fool for a good few months at least.  But it's best to always live with the mentality ""One of these days I will get caught"" and that will definitely keep you on your toes. Number one mistake for anyone evading LE = Getting too relaxed, taking advantage of their freedom. Plan escape routes, know the area you live in. Know the best places to hide, it's always good to know this stuff even if you aren't doing anything wrong. Suppose who call it survival really, in any eventuality, most people aren't prepared from evading their next door neighbor if he/she comes round with a shotgun to blow your brains out (it can happen right?), what if there was an electricity outage for a week, people would be rioting, who's to say your house wouldn't be next?

By that theory, they would be there for drugs, and yet they got other stuff. You think if they see other illegal stuff, they are just going to let it be there lol? That seems like stuff you read, but it's not actually how they will be. Even if they throw it out, you're still arrested and on their radar forever and you still lost everything. It's up to them if they don't want to announce themselves or if they want to knock. If they are silent, they'll handcuff everybody and you won't be able to tell them not to do things or read the warrant until later. This is what they do. LE are criminals.

I think that's an old fashioned way to look at it, like when the gas lamps went out and there were literally no lights on the streets until the policemen with their portable gas lamps could come and search for the culprit, by then because of the lack of cars the culprit would be long gone. Things have changed since then. A woman and a boy got raped (not connected with each other, different time, different place, different day - could of been the same guy who knows) in the middle of the day only a few months ago, the man was identified for one of the cases and the other is still being hunted down. That's just an example. Cars are stolen in the middle of the night and are then tracked, some even without tracking devices within a few hours or days. Nowadays I think it's safe to live with the fact that anything can happen at any one time, only what you know and what you can put into effect whilst you are committing crime is what can possibly save you, if not allude you from the law for a specific amount of time if not indefinitely. Police work all hours now a days and depending on where you live and what area, will patrol certain areas more but you can guarantee there is a police car within the vicinity if not on scene in 5 minutes or less. Look at those coming back from Syria now from different countries, how is it even possible a government can trace people when they are thousands and thousands of miles away? And you think you are safe behind your computer? That's the reality of today. If people can be tracked and monitored with little effort and are thousands of miles away then anything that happens in your hometown or around you can be analysed and determined. I just think it's about who you are dealing with. If you are dealing with your local police department then chances are, you will beat them but if you are talking about the likes of the NSA and GCHQ, secret services then, count your blessings. There isn't much those guys don't know, then again it's also about what you know. Think it's safe to say, knowledge is power in this game.

It's easier for them to pull you over too. No traffic because night time = nobody blocking them from zipping out of where they were sitting. A lot of times, you can't get pulled over because you are surrounded by traffic and there's also traffic behind you  So it's just best to avoid night. What if they do an illegal search? Doesn't matter that you weren't high or weren't speeding or x, y, z. What if they don't throw out that evidence? The whole idea is that you take control of what you can control.

If you'd like to improve your OPSEC, I'd purchase a VPN (mullvad is excellent), spoof your MAC address, use a VM with a linux distro, and then connect to Tor. Alternatively, you can just boot into TAILS and you'll be set. Vendors should be layering all of their online security so if one part fails, they are still untraceable (VPS --> VM works well, but there are many different options).

Are you speaking strictly of anonymity? I suppose TOR was designed for that. However,do you concede that they other things are at ALL helpful? Or are they a waste of time? Let's consider that a VPN can allegedly hide the fact you're using TOR from your ISP - doesn't it matter if your ISP knows?

That way you get a tracking number which you can give to the customer who can see where it is and how far along it is. Just standard to get someone unrelated to you in your 'field' to go to the PO and send the package, eventuality is using a fake name and a safe return-to address. From a customer perspective, you'd probably just have to use a fake signature or get someone else to turn up at the door, or just not order it to your address in the first place. And pay someone else to sign it. Rates at the moment are about Â£5.50 per letter and Â£6.20 per large letter, if you can fit your products in those sizes then you are good to go an that's International Business Mail Tracked & Signed. But for parcels, with PO is International Business Parcels Tracked & Signed and start at Â£6.50 per item or Â£6.70 per kilogram but to be honest, you need to be spending Â£5k a year and more with Royal Mail to be able to use their business services. Again, fake name, fake address or middle-man name and address but you get decent rates and never had a problem leaving the UK.

I buy them online and pay by credit card. So I ask to receive the bitcoin to an Armory address 111111111111111QAUW8hU74VsaCZXoR3QhqmZx (i create a new address each time). Then I send them to the Helix address 22222222222222AMU8eAbQrMJ6qZduMDyk2gR to anonymize them. Question : for the bitcoins to stay clean and anonymous, can I send them from Helix back to my Armory on same PC to a new Armory generated 333333333333333s1KxHkTRbnusbCncwWAn4i address ?Or with this way, will the bitcoins become again linked to me and traceable ???

"Evolution Forums","Sensory_Agonist","29550","2014-10-26T03:32:46","Re: Washing bitcoins important question","Security & Anonymity","I would recommend using local bit coins (LBC) through Tor operating on Tails running from a USB, and storing your bitcoins in cold wallets on your persistant volume. On LCB you can buy bitcoins and deposit cash straight into the sellers bank account (Many countries have cash deposit machines outside bank branches, where you dont need to insert a card to deposit cash to someones bank account, since your not entering the bank its perfectly acceptable to wear a motorbike helmet that will obstruct your identity from CC cameras, or hell, since western countries are so politically correct these days, wear a burka, that way you can even enter the bank in a full disguise) Its best practice to never assoate your real ID with bitcoins (if you plan to eventually use them on a darknet marketplace). Some people recommend to use a VPN, but then your trusting the VPN's word that they dont log, I would try to find a clean IP by pointing Tor at a web proxy, of which may take a bit of searching to find one that is not blocked. Lets say you associated your IP address while buying bitcoins with your credit card, then you tumbled your coins without masking your IP address, when you received your tumbed coins they would again be associated with your original IP, so you would have wasted your time tumbling. The bitcoins you received would not presumably be associated to your credit card (If the tumber did what they advertised), but they would be associated to your receiving IP address, which, if you used the same PC, would be associated with the same IP that you used to buy the original BTC with your CC. And then assumingly you will send the BTCs to a market place, so the trail wouldnt be too hard to follow if some agency had reason enough to allocate the manpower to go digging into your activities. While tumbling your bitcoins is all well and good, and it is always best practice to use the best security possible, I think the most important part is buying from a vendor that takes stealth seriously, uses MBB bags that have been correctly washed for both polar and non-polar molecules. If someone (a small time personal user) gets busted its most likely to be from a tip-off they received from the sorting office, then at the drop address its easy to organize a sting where the receiver will be caught red-handed. That's far easier for LE than analysing transactions on the blockchain.  On one side you could argue that if your an extreemly easy target, LE may bust you to set an example to the community, otherwise I dont think they would waste their limited resources to go after small fish, buying small quantities for personal use. It would make much more sense to plan to bust big vendors who make millions, LE are, after all a business and would love nothing more than seizing a whole load of dirty BTCs/product that would up their performance rating, make a big buzz in the media and show tax payers that they are doing what they are being payed to do. How would the average tax payer react if they knew LE spent 100+ man hours, coordinated across multiple agencies to bust Mary in Oregon who ordered $40 worth of weed from the internet.

At least you can do this. Don't chain it if you're so lazy but at least do this. As TMS's said on first reply post, it's dangerous for you. By that case your ISP see an encrypted connection from your VPN provider and some malicious tor exit nodes can see not your real ip > just your vpn's ip. Some companies like airvpn provides a 2-layer connection with tor+vpn. Just google a bit and you can give lots of info about these.

I still don't prefer RDPs [despite what people, here, insist], as they are just another potential point of failure, plus insecure by modern standards [just like vnc, to that regard], in and by themselves. You should, however, be fine. If you are going the paranoid route, though, you might find solace in adding a VPN in BOTH the host AND the guest. They won't bypass tor, though. The most that could happen would be feds owning an exit node, or running javascript malware like CIPAV finding your IP out, if you leave it enabled [though it's required for many payment systems, so...], but if you have the VPN in the host OS, then it won't fetch your real IP, so you're fine.  VPN and tor is fine enough though. You don't need RDP. In fact, general rule of thumb for everyone, RDPs are horse-crap!

If the NSA wants you, they're going to get you unless you're backed by an advanced opposition state sponsor.  I think the bit of truth in this is that Apple is tired of regular LE getting info for free. Companies make money when they are served with legal requests. This is a way to make LE pay Apple to get info.  Not just that but there is more data now than ever and a huge market for selling that info to advertising companies. The new iphone collects every kind of biometric data you can imagine. Your fingerprints, heart rate, how long you stand, how long you sit, how many steps you take, where you go, what you eat and now what you buy with ApplePay. Up until now that kind of detailed info was never available before. Health Insurance companies are going to pay out the ass for that info so they can jack up rates on 'at risk' people. Apple implemented better encryption so they can be the only source for that info and charge a gigantic premium. A little story about the iphone. If you have one go to Settings>Privacy>Location Services>System Services>Frequent Locations. The phone keeps track of everywhere you've been and how long you've been there. In my girlfriends phone there were two locations that stuck out 'Home' and 'Work'. I asked her when she put those in and she said she didn't. Turns out that the phone can very accurately guess home because it can overlay that location on a map and tell if the building you're in is residential or commercial. Also, the phone stops moving for 6-8 hours - you must be sleeping there. Same thing for work. Bottom line, if you value OPSEC don't ever take your phone with you. Use it to confuse whoever might be watching.

Its by far the safest way so long as you don't lose the wallet key or there's a massive price slump. Hell of a lot less hassle than putting it all on iban cards or prepaids.  Edit : thinking about it if its in cash i see what you mean about the hassle although it could be done through localbitcoins but i assume you want anonymity too which rules out sending yourself a western union transfer unless your careful but then again if its in cash you gonna have to show your face somewhere along the line so WU would probably be the safest.

Making the code for starting a new wallet: or an existing wallet: Here is what those options do (via ./electrum -h)-1, --oneserver       connect to one server only-v, --verbose         show debugging information Without -1 I noticed that Electrum usualy doesn't connect to the .onion address on the first try, and then starts switching to the clearnet servers. If you don't connect to the .onion, just close the GUI and issue the command again in the terminal. It will connect eventually (3 tries usually for me).

I discovered my method by reading news articles about people getting caught for mail fraud in my country and was able to see how they were doing it and why it failed/how they were caught and to work my own solutions into that. It sounds ridiculous and there is that proverb of ""don't take criminal advice from someone in jail"" but the drop method works for me so far.  Sometimes all you need is the seed and you can grow it from there",""

Data Storage: Online / Cloud","Security & Anonymity","doesn't matter even if they tried, using spaces in the password protecting the archive renders bruteforcing useless. It interprets the spaces as characters, making it impossible to calculate the password. I've not even ever had a single dmca or malware notice from any of the hosters, and many even scan for ""illegal"" data in there. However, if you decide to crypt your malware stub, don't upload it to anywhere cloud-related and if you wanna scan it, use f#ckav's scanner. They don't distribute samples to AVs. and I don't even always need explicitly only-tor, because the file hosters I use for criminal activity don't keep logs. And they're almost always hosting anything and everything illegal, so they wouldn't even respond to a warrant, especially since there's no jurisdiction from U.S. feds in places like, let's say Russia. In fact, in some regards, using tor would only make it even more obvious of my darkweb identity, not less obvious, given I don't generate a new tor ""identity"" between visiting sites, if I use tor globally. I use a VPN hosted in a crime-friendly country, and privoxy set to forward tor through socks5t. I use octo-proxy-chain along with VPN still, for things like jabber. I siphon, however, for instance, jabber file transfer conference proxies from most private fraud forums. Different ones.

Linux, on the other hand, has great utilities for encryption built in, on top of being far more secure.",""

"Evolution Forums","themostseekrit","30097","2014-10-29T20:42:41","Re: Have problem with truecrypt 7.1a, help!","Security & Anonymity","Honestly in my opinion that's more of a personal choice than anything else. I mentioned Ubuntu because it's pretty, easy to use, and simple (again, the installer even gives you the option for full disk encryption and will seamlessly do everything for you), and even that is leagues better than Windows in my opinion. There are probably more 'hardcore' distributions that may be more robust, security-oriented, and possibly better, but really it's mostly up to you and you need to consider what you need it for, your technical ability, etc. For example, if you barely know how to use a computer, switching to Ubuntu would be your best bet and you'd still be doing yourself a massive favour in my eyes. If this is a dedicated computer just for secure shit, and you know what you want and your way around configuring shit, there is probably a distribution you can take more advantage of. Keep in mind even Ubuntu can be made pretty secure and serve a solid purpose. Or for all I know, you may want to use Tails full-time (which wouldn't require a hard drive at all, lol).","verysafeninja wrote:thanks themostseekrit. what linux should i use?"

And the best Rates","Security & Anonymity","Hey guys,  I'm a small time buyer, only personal use, only a gram or two of whatever here and there or a few pills. I never sell any of it. Recently I have been getting mail shipped to my house with no problems, but paranoia is getting to me a little bit, as well as my roommate wondering how I know all these people from around the country and world. So I was first thinking of getting a PO Box, but the guys on Reddit SR and Reddit DNM's gave me pretty mixed opinions of that idea, and in the end, the majority were against it.  But by reading these posts I discovered the Private Mail Box (PMB). Which gives you a real address (no PO has to go on the label), usually gives 24 hour access, depending upon who you go with they will sign for mail that requires signature (which takes some heat off), and maybe the best part is they will never reveal your true address unless they get a court order.  For me, this seems like it would meet my needs perfectly, the only issue I have is that most of them are pretty expensive, at least compared to PO Boxes. The medium size PO Box is around $75-100 a year, but the PMB, again depending where you go, is about double that and I have seen ones for over $200 a year. The most popular is UPS, but prices and even user agreements vary from store to store with them. So I wanted to ask the community: Do you think PMBs are a good way to go, and if so, where have you found the best rates?",""

Mount your log files and tmp folders in RAM. You can do this by editing /etc/fstab. What ever folders you designate here will be mounted in RAM and erased every time you restart your computer. I don't want to let something slip out here so this is a non-complete list from my fstab but you can get creative. Maybe a location that has thumbnails for example. I won't go into detail on the explanation so if you've a question Google is your friend. Two thing worth noting. I will point out that I have a large amount of RAM so simply copying this to your fstab might fuck things up. You can set the 'size=' setting lower if you don't have at least 12 Gb of memory. and 'mode=' does matter depending on what you're trying to mount into RAM. Another easy hack is to make it so the computer cannot write to the recently used files located at /home/$USER/.local/share/recently-used.xbel AND /root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel. This is accomplished using the chattr command. This means anywhere 'recently used' displays it will be empty.

To answer OPs question, it really depends on how illegal what your doing is. The company you might be scamming won't have access to the phone companies records, and won't be able to tell it's the same phone.  If the cops get involved, they will be able to link all the SIMs to the phone very quickly.

"Evolution Forums","kittendew","30615","2014-11-07T03:56:50","Re: Burner phones and swapping SIMs","Security & Anonymity","The irony of people who think burner phones are safe... sigh. If a phone is on, YOU CAN BE TRACKED geographically to an accuracy of about 10 feet. This should not be a surprise. A fundamental principle of cellular networks is that each cell tower needs to know your signal strength (so they can pass you to the next tower, or ""cell"", when you get out of range - and thus your call stays connected). A natural effect of this is that when you're in range of more than 2 towers... i.e., 99.99% of the time... your exact location can be determined by triangulation. Each tower knows how far you are from IT... so when there's 3 points of data, you are precisely pinpointed. And yes: this information is both collected AND stored by pretty much all cell networks. For over 15 years this has been used as a consumer feature in Australian phones. Instead of the provider's name or logo on the phone, you'll often see the name of the street or suburb you're walking through. This changes as you change streets. So it doesn't f***king MATTER if you have a ""burner"" phone; if that phone has been on and you've been in your house - you're fucked. There is now reliable evidence placing that phone in your possession. That's a standard of proof far in excess of what's needed for a search warrant or even an arrest warrant. Note that ""off"" on a cellphone is pretty near impossible. Most cellphones (and all smartphones) stay connected to the cell network even when ""off"". The only reliable way to prevent your phone accessing the cell network is to physically remove the battery. This is almost impossible to do on many smartphones. For example:you'll need a screwdriver, a spudger, a suction cup and about 5 minutes of work to do that with an iPhone. Bottom line: no cellular phone is secure. Period. You should think of a cellphone as your own, portable tracking device - because that's precisely what it is. It doesn't matter if the phone is registered in your name, or if the IMEI is forged or whatever: if that phone is in any way functional, you are 100% trackable. And, in fact, TRACKED. Even if you use a ""secure app"" such as TextSecure or Wickr, you better make damn sure you're also using a VPN over your cellphone data connection, ALL the time the app is installed. This is impossible on the iPhone (it drops VPNs as soon as the screen's off) and it's pretty much unheard-of on Android, because it will kill the battery... most VPNs require a heartbeat signal once every 10 seconds, so your phone is always transmitting and your battery life is going to be a few hours maximum. As for accessibility of data, if you're a member of any Five Eyes country then your police force has an open connection into the cellular networks. For example, Bell and Rogers in Canada are on record for openly admitting that the federal police have a permanent link into their networks, allowing them to access the entirety of their cell network data at all times. This has been the case for over 10 years. They don't even require a warrant to do this as such data is classified as ""non-private"" under the laws protecting privacy. The same is true for pretty much every other first world country. So if you think that the police have to have ""reasonable cause"" to start poking into telco's cell tower records to track your phone... think again. So: DON'T USE PHONES for sensitive shit. Ever. EVER.

All data is encrypted in transit; even Wickr has no idea what a message says. The only people who can read the data are you and the sender/recipient. This is achieved via public/private key (Diffie-Hellman) encryption which is the same thing that you use when you log into (say) your online banking. The solution is to drag all your clients into the 21st century and insist they use an app such as Wickr, PrivaText, TextSecure or any of the other numerous options. Almost all your clients are used to downloading apps on their phones... even chat apps like SnapChat and Whatsapp... so asking them to take 2 minutes to download one that saves your a** is not too big a demand. If the client won't take 2 minutes to ensure your safety, then you should let your client walk away. You don't need that shit. Encourage all your legit friends and clients to do so as well. This creates ""plausible deniability""... if you're ever ""caught"" with Wickr on your phone (which isn't a crime) you can easily explain it away as the simple fact that due to the NSA/Snowdon revelations, all your friends are using these apps in protest. That's completely reasonable and will defeat any ""reasonable cause"" attempts. Plus you gain by hiding your illegal comms in with legit ones. It's a perfect solution. Note that these apps all have autodestruct timers on messages you send... that stops people keeping months or years of your communications on their phone because they're too lazy to delete them off. They get deleted no matter what, as soon as the timer ends... poof!  As for going to pick up drugs, or deal, or murder someone or whatever... just don't take your phone with you, period. That way you cannot be traced to your pickup point/place of crime commission. In fact you kind of have an ""alibi"" you can use to suggest you were at home the whole time, since your phone was  For a few bucks you can also buy Faraday-cage style pouches which block cell signals. Place the cell in the metal-mesh-lined pouch and it ceases to communicate with the outside world. There are heaps of these around; search on Amazon.

There will always be a risk at any stage no matter where it gets delivered to, if it is your house, there is a risk but in small amounts it is unlikely they will pay any attention anyway.If you use an empty house/office or similar there is always a risk when you turn up to pick it up. To be fair there is no safe way to get anything sent to you, but it also depends on what it is being sent, the value of it and where it is being sent from. Large amounts of drugs for example can be risky if caught by customs as they may do a controlled delivery to catch you, but as said if you buy drugs in very small amounts even if caught by customs they will probably just destroy it as it will cost to much to come and catch you and then give you a caution for personal use. Just depends on what it is and amounts I suppose. I would always stick to smaller amounts if from outside the UK, but inside UK it will be easier to take larger amounts.",""

If you are going to be using your VPN router with any of those functions, then I would recommend the $350 VPN router. But you can just as easily get away with a $60 VPN router.  The DD-WRT routers work really great and are completely customizable. You can can crank up the wireless bandwidth if you like, run different types of DNS servers, etc. etc. The DD-WRT router I am using only supports certain types of VPN configurations and providers. You will have to do your research before you invest but it will be worth it in the end.  AIRVPN has a great walkthrough tutorial for DD-WRT routers.",""
"Evolution Forums","vaperman","23229","2014-09-08T16:00:32","Tracking provided immediately","Security & Anonymity","Hi all, somewhat new to the EVO forum, but not the DW marketplace. Recently placed an order for weed from one of the top vendors on EVO that has nothing but positivie reviews. After s/he accepted my order and marked shipped, they immediately provided the tracking via privnote link. Now this seems a bit suspicious to me as I've never had a vendor do this. I know they typically don't hand out tracking so you don't track from the clearweb and de-anonymize yourself, or track from tor and have your package potentially flagged. Considering the amount, I would doubt that LE would go to these lengths, nor would it prove anything so I'm not worried, but still approaching with caution. Likewise I don't intend to even look at it unless it doesn's show for some reason, but judging from the vendors rep, I doubt it will be an issue. Also note, I'm not naming the vendor here as I don't want this to seem negative against them since it's more than likely just good customer service that I've never seen before. So if you have any opinion or experience with this, please let me know.

An advantage to the DVD is that it is read only so no malware can written to it - which is not true for the USB stick. one suggestion could be to use the DVD to run TAILs and setup up a persistent storage volume on the USB (most people recommend encryption on the USB stick) i used to have to create every imaginable boot media there is. i like Magic ISO because you can load the ISO file into it and add stuff or extract the boot image (to a .bin file) that then can be used to make any USB stick bootable. or you can find boot images on the web that are generic for USB. another option is to install a VM on your PC and boot TAILs from inside there.

These devices can now perform tasks or activities that were normally being processed in a normal desktop or laptop computers. Attachment to such devices is immensely increasing in peopleâs lives. From a digital forensic perspective, these devices hold an enormous wealth of information concerning someoneâs activities whether it is personal or work related. The mobile devices are commonly being treated as mini computers as they possess a similar processing ability as normal computers would only on a smaller scale. However, in this setting, these devices are commonly portrayed as objects to the investigation. Suspected crimes or fraudulent activities can often be found in these phones or tablets, and they normally tell a story of what might have had happened. My recent MSc. dissertation project investigates the possibility of mobile devices of becoming a subject or tool to aid digital forensic investigations. Somewhat shifting the paradigm of viewing the device from another angle or perspective and see it differently. In this particular setting, the device will no longer be treated as an object to investigate; instead it provides the investigators with digital forensic tools capabilities while embracing unique features of smartphones or tablets. Someone will not always carry their forensic workstations with them, how about the likelihood of a phone or tablet with a digital forensic app? The initial idea was raised from a discussion I had in class during the course of my study at the University of Westminster. The functions and features of a portable forensic duplicator can potentially be brought to mobile devices, specifically Android which is built using a simplified Linux kernel. In addition, the USB On the Go (OTG) functionality has made plugging multiple USB sticks or memory cards (even portable HDD in some cases) possible to certain model of Android devices (http://www.usb.org/developers/onthego). Why not further utilise this capability in Android to mimic the portable forensic duplicator functionalities and possibly create forensic images of small storage devices? With this being said, some of the core bit level copy and verification tools such as dd and hashing commands are already made available through a number of Terminal apps in Android. Considering some of the existing open source forensic tools are built for GNU Linux and UNIX, I started off my experiments by trying to cross compile the source code of those tools into binaries that can be executed in Android. Some succeeded and some were not. Following a further discussion with my project supervisor, emerged another idea of leveraging the computing capability of these small devices in a triage situation. A setting of where streamlining several processes together to reveal information fairly quickly. This with the assumption that all of the normal forensic workstations are occupied processing other stuff, some USB sticks or memory cards will still need to be analysed for information. The additional resource of mobile devices can potentially be utilised in these types of situation to extract contents of these small-scale storage devices. This article contains the idea of the project and the implementation of the proof of concept tool that was built under the Android platform. The tool focuses on extraction and analysis of JPEG picture files from either digital cameras or smartphones. The result was a prototype of an Android app that can analyse the content of USB sticks, memory cards or raw forensic images by extracting image/picture files; visualise them as soon as they are extracted and reveals their metadata information as well as translating some of the metadata content into something meaningful. All of these activities are tied together in one simplified work flow. A developed Android application package (.apk) for installation, an example dataset and complete source code of the tool is currently available on Github (https://github.com/andritona/MobileTriage) to download under GPL license. A simple documentation to install the app and build or compile the source code is included. The app is designed to work for Android version 2.2 to 4.4 for both phones and tablets. Although some of the layout elements may need to be readjusted on certain devices.  Requirements and Design Components The proof of concept tool or app will need to have the ability to process picture files content, extract EXIF metadata and translate some of the items into information that can lead someone to reach certain decisions quickly. The following requirements were constructed in order to meet these objectives:     Locate any JPEG picture files (both allocated and non allocated (deleted), both complete and partial or corrupted JPEG files).    Decode the extracted JPEG picture files in parallel to the data extraction process in order to be visually analysed and bookmarked.    Extract EXIF metadata content and thumbnail data from the selected or bookmarked images, provide the ability to convert the GPS tags into location coordinates and further translate the results into an actual address.    Provide a method to view the extracted GPS location coordinates in a map application to visually pin point the address.    Multi-threading capability to allow parallel processing of JPEG data and metadata extraction as well as visualisation.    Provide a simple and intuitive user interface (UI). Method of Data Extraction Data carving was chosen as the preferred method to extract JPEG files data. Although the choosing did come with certain compromises such as the absence of file system metadata (filenames, timestamps, size and deletion status) which presumably could provide further insights to an investigation. However, due to the limited time constraints I had with the project, the approach seemed to be ideal at the time. An example implementation of data carving project using Java was incorporated into the tool (http://web.cs.du.edu/~mitchell/forensics/projects/data_carving/example_java_carver.zip). The code was examined, modified and optimised thus enabling the function to run properly within Android. This was a huge time saver for me. Multi-threading Android provides the ability of parallel processing using native Java thread method or a simple and ready to use Android thread pool method (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html). The latter will provide an Android managed threads or to execute any batch processes that we throw at it. Basically, it will just process any incoming requests and assign any of the available threads. Luckily, there are enough resources on the Internet and numerous good video tutorials on how to understand and achieve both approaches. (For someone who has no prior experience of using both Java and Android development, I found video tutorials to be most helpful). Visualisation + Metadata Extraction and Translation Fortunately (again), Android provides various built-in libraries required to perform the remaining tasks or activities for the proof of concept tool. Guidance on how to use these libraries are well documented in the official Android website, however finding examples on how to apply certain methods was a different story. One of the libraries used in this implementation was for the EXIF extraction functionality (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ExifInterface.html). The built-in library in Android only provides a small number of EXIF tags available, however I found that the tags were sufficient enough to represent the capability and well within the project scope. Putting Everything Together A simple pre-configured work flow was constructed with the idea that the overall process has to be simple enough so that no one would struggle in using the tool. Therefore, allowing even the less experienced individuals to perform such task. Individuals can focus more on the outcome or results rather than spending precious time on how to navigate the tool. This is the base concept that shaped and formed the intuitive user interface (UI) requirement. MobileTriage Workflow From the outline of the work flow, the individuals will need to do the following:     Load the evidence (this can be a block/raw device or a raw dd image file)    Visually review and bookmark images of interests.    View the final report containing bookmarked images along with their metadata content. The rest of the processes in the work flow are simplified and automated by the proof of concept tool. The Proof of Concept Tool - MobileTriage App 1. Load the Evidence File LoadEvidence After opening the app, the user will be presented with a prompt to select electronic evidence file. This can be a raw dd image file or a block device file in Android, assuming the appropriate permission is set for the corresponding file. After selecting the file, the carving process will immediately execute and read the file input searching for JPEG EXIF signature. Note: Accessing raw block device from an app in Android requires root level privilege over the device, otherwise the intended block device will not be accessible to read. There also a number of good tutorials on how to obtain root level access over a specific device, however this may void the manufacturer's warranty of the device. I have discovered that using a block device to be read in Android app requires the permission of the block device file to be modified in order to allow other users apart from root to read the file. Mainly because each app is treated as individual user in the ecosystem (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/). This can be achieved by incorporating the elevated chmod command in the shell through the Android app for the corresponding block device. However, I do believe that this is not ideal but can be considered as a temporary or workaround solution. I have not yet found other alternatives to this at the moment. For the purpose of the project, I decided to use a dd image file placed in the internal storage of the device instead of reading from raw/block device in order to get more testing done on different types of phone and tablet. Therefore, the non-rooting route was the preferred method of choice. 2. Data Extraction and Visualisation Carving2 After the process finds and extracts a carved file, the file will immediately be decoded as a picture to be visually analysed while continuing the carving process. These both processes run in parallel to one another with the use of threading. Each individual picture can be selected and will invoke the Android internal picture viewer application (another app can be selected as default, for example the Gallery app). This will give the user further flexibility of using the pinch to zoom in functionality for closer inspection of picture files. User will also be able to select or bookmark images of interests to be short listed for report generation which will immediately trigger the metadata extraction and translation process. The swipe gesture functionality provides a method in browsing or scrolling through the number of images in a horizontal movement fairly quickly. 3. Metadata Extraction and Translation (Report) reportLandscape EXIF metadata content and thumbnail data of the bookmarked images are then extracted in the report view of the app. Some of the values are translated into useful information. In this particular instance, the EXIF GPS tags are converted into location coordinates format which further translated into addresses values by using the built-in Android's reverse geocoding capability (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html). The ability to display the app in both landscape or portrait mode and the vertical gesture swiping functionality also provides greater flexibility in viewing the report. Each of the item that has GPS or location coordinates can also be tapped or selected to invoke the built-in Google Maps application. This will provide the visual pinpoint location of where the picture was presumably taken. In one of the examples, a possible corrupted or edited picture may still has the original thumbnail data intact. In addition to this, the address location of the where the picture was taken can potentially be more useful than the set of numbers in the GPS tags. All these values can possibly give inferences to reach certain decisions quickly. 4. Visual Location in Map Application GoogleMap The visual location or address of a picture may provide certain benefits to the individuals. Surrounding areas in close proximity displaying various landmarks, bars, restaurants, schools, offices and any other place of interests can be observed. This might end up giving further clues that can be followed up in certain event reconstruction scenarios. Of course these are some of the few assumptions that I had to take in when constructing the project as they might differ in real investigations. Known Issues and Findings 1. Data Carving Performance The performance of the data carving process is not satisfactory. The same carving code takes almost 10x faster in a laptop running OpenJDK on GNU Linux 64bit. Although the hardware and software specifications might not be an apple to apple comparison but this can roughly represent the behaviour. This is likely because the use of DalvikVM or Android Runtime that act as VM to the Java code is not meant to perform complex computational operations (https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html). It also adds another layer of execution between the code and the device. One way to possibly mitigate this is by outsourcing the intensive portion of the computation into a more low-level language such as C in Android. In theory, this can be done using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) to allow interoperability between the normal app and the native code. An experiment of performing simple Fibonacci algorithm was conducted using both Java and C natively in Android (https://thenewcircle.com/s/post/96/using_ndk_for_performance_dalvik_versus_native). The native code was almost 17x faster in its execution. The results seem promising enough to be applied for the concept and therefore bypassing the requirements of data carving through Android VM using Java code. Another way to resolve the issue is probably to implement a FAT32 file system parser. In theory, this would provide both allocated and non allocated (deleted) files and skip the need for the data carving functionality. In addition, it will also provide file system metadata that contains filenames, timestamps, size, location and also deletion status. The latter can be quite useful to demonstrate the existence of deliberate intent to remove certain files. The assumption taken in this regard is that the data is stored in a contiguous non fragmented manner. Both approaches can potentially worth to be considered, however, due to time constraints and my lack understanding of C programming language, both of them were not pursued further in the project. 2. Access to Raw/Block Device I have not yet been successful in finding ways to allow Java Android app to read the content of the block device or files that are owned by root. However, on a rooted Android device, it allows the su -c command to be invoked with another binary to elevate its privilege from within the app, but not elevating the app's privilege itself. The chmod command to modify the permission of the block device was tested using this method. A mount command can be invoked using a Terminal app or adb shell to identify the location of a block device and its mount point. It was observed that the raw or block device for the USB OTG will appear under the /dev/block/vold/ on the Android device using a numbered scheme. For example /dev/block/vold/8:0 will be the entire storage device and /dev/block/vold/8:1 is the first partition on that particular device. Root level privilege is required to access the content of the parent location. Anther alternative will be to have the whole code developed natively using C and not the Java SDK within Android. This approach will likely loose the Android's graphical user interface unique capabilities as everything will need to be executed through a Terminal app. This is done by issuing series of commands under root user privilege as they would on GNU Linux or UNIX systems. 3. USB On The Go (OTG) Auto Mount Feature In my testing, I found that the USB OTG functionality tries to auto mount a device when it is plugged or inserted to the interface such as USB OTG cable or powered hub. By default this behaviour only happens on FAT file systems variants. Unfortunately, these are exactly what most USB sticks or memory cards from digital cameras or smartphones be formatted under. This behaviour will ultimately tamper the integrity of the evidence in question. USB_OTG There are some good discussions in the forum (http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-4/orig-development/usb-otg-externally-powered-usb-otg-t2181820) on ways to enable or disable the auto mounting feature. The discussion talks about the techniques to modify initialisation files for mounting block device as well as performing minor modification to the kernel itself. Both methods likely require the mobile device to have root level privilege. Disabling the auto mount feature should be the main aim of the approach, although I believe that performing an auto mount with read only access will still be an acceptable solution. Another alternative that I could possibly think of is to integrate a portable or mini USB write blocker to the USB OTG interface. In theory, this could work and will not need any sort of modifications to the Android kernel or configuration files. Although, root access may still be required for accessing the raw or block device. Again, due to resource constraints I have not personally tested both of these approaches. Challenges and Ideas for Improvements There are a number of ideas that I believe can be useful and further implemented within the app. These items include:     FAT32 File system parser to extract file content and system metadata, allowing for faster retrieval and processing of small-scale storage devices.    Ability to extract more EXIF metadata tags from various different manufacturers or to integrate the existing EXIF extraction open source tools into the app.    Ability to create forensic duplication from the raw or block device which would provide bit stream copy of the device along with verification information such as timestamps and hash values.    Support for dynamic user configuration settings from within the app, currently some of the values are still hard-coded into the source code. These values are set as global variables that can be modified.    Ability to use compact database such as SQLite to store the extracted results. This would provide scalability and further flexibility.    Ability to extract the multiple coordinates into Google Earth's KML format (https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/mapsSupport). This would enable multiple locations of the images to be displayed in the map application, thus might be helpful in certain location-based pattern analysis.    Ability to export the report results into known formats such as Portable Document Format (PDF) and send or share the results through email or other app. In theory, this would provide information exchange to happen quickly between individuals (Assuming preventive measures were taken beforehand to protect and secure the information both at rest and in transit). Conclusion The app is far from perfection. There are still a number of findings and improvements that need to be resolved before thinking about putting the tool to a good use.  The MobileTriage app is just an example of how the concept can be implemented. Mobile devices with their unique features in various types of platform can potentially be utilised to assist in processing electronic evidence. Development of digital forensic tools under this platform can open up new possibilities, methods and approaches that can be applied following certain limitations. Being aware of such limitations can provide new opportunities as well as challenges for digital forensics practitioners, students and community to develop good mobile forensic tools that are acknowledged by the profession and industry. Thank you all very much for reading the article, I welcome any discussions or comments regarding the idea. I certainly hope that the article can be useful and wish that more ideas can be derived from this work.

Don't think your android has malware because it's open-source? Think again. There's such a thing as bootkit. Has real bricking issues but if they get it to work, then all phones have 'em.  I tend to agree with someone else in this thread, apple sucks because apple wants to suck.  But NSA will always suck the life out of ALL systems, regardless of brand or software. The saying is, what the leviathan wants, the leviathan shall get. Whether it's by consent or disallowed intruding, is not the question to be asked (except if one were to file a lawsuit). They used rogue ssl certs with google, so they'll backdoor communications, even when it's not authorized by the company, let alone the individual whose use of the service is almost undoubtedly, not even illegal. Battalion, against NSA backdooring? Or against general-purpose tracking-down? If it has a bootkit, then no addition will protect against it, unless you find a way to remove it, yourself.

If you're really paranoid, go to a friends house or public wifi to download it, check its signatuture, install it to a disposable USB, boot it, plug another USB and install Tails to that one via Tails itself, format the disposable USB, go to your nearest church and reflect on what you're about to do. Alternatively, you can detatch the HD of an old laptop and run Tails with only RAM memory. Note, if you dont want your ISP to know you're using TOR (and probblably Tails) use a VPN, I personally don't care as all outgoing traffic out of Tails in encrypted and through Tor, be sure the VPN provider is legit as well. Also, if you're going to use a VM on top of a host OS, be sure your host only allows connections through Tor, otherwise malware inside your Vm could bypass to the host and compromise you system. More on that here: https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/330/running-a-virtual-machine-vm-that-can-only-connect-through-tor If you don'e want to go through all the technical jargon, just get Tails, its your safest bet. For messaging, use a jabber/xmpp/irc account with Pidgin and OTR plugin, it offers the best security possible if used via Tor, it is also loaded in Tails as well. You can also learn to use bitmessage ( it requires manual install in Tails). Emails check here: http://www.hacker10.com/internet-anonymity/list-of-the-best-tor-email-hidden-services/

EFF: Taking legal action to protect data privacy rights and keep the US further away from an Orwellian state. I could go on, but I think those are all causes most of this community can get behind. The information stored on the blockchain is a double edged sword. On one hand I can provide proof without fault I have made a donation for a specific amount, by giving the customer the tx hash. However, if the 'customer' happens to be LE this takes a risk of revealing addresses connected either to myself or a marketplace, even when best mixing practices have been implemented.

I am interested in doing PayPal and just general carding but i'm struggling with my proxy speed and i'm not sure if its something i'm doing or using shitty proxies. My current setup is burner laptop-public wifi-vpn-socks5-website. I have only tested and haven't actually started any carding but after visiting particular sites and browsing i have found its incredibly slow and would prove hard to do anything within a reasonable amount of time. I'm using Mullvad, Vip 72 socks and proxifier. Any help would be appreciated.",""

When you use Tor, the ISP only sees that you have a connection using 127.0.0.1. Because of this, they can't see that you're using Tor, on a deepnet site, Carding, or even surfing for porn. They just don't know.FYI, nothing here is unethical. The only unethical thing you can do here is buy fullz and contact the owner of the card or profile to let them know their identity was stolen.

As it's been said, the most you could do is run through a VM.  proxifier works only with proxies/socks, NOT vpn...don't get the two confused. VPN uses a tap adapter and tunnels all traffic coming in and out of the OS. proxy is simply a set of servers through which your traffic is channelled...while you can use a proxy through a vpn and a vpn through a proxy, and a proxy through a proxy, you can't realistically run a vpn through a vpn, not on the same host.

Security expert Bruce Schneier points out that it is more than most people think, says Chris Baraniuk.RelatedDigitised dollar billSurprising way to get rich online(Thinkstock)Robot cars: Lifesaving invention?(Getty Images)Is tech making you smarter?(Getty Images)âWhy I want to die at 75â(Getty Images)Dawkins: What are aliens like?gettyHidden history of hackers The birth of the hacker sub-culture Do you have secrets? Security expert Bruce Schneier has little patience for those who say they donât. When asked about government and corporate surveillance, there are some who shrug their shoulders and say they have nothing to fear because they have nothing to hide. Schneierâs response? âI ask them their salary and they wonât tell me. I ask them about their sexual fantasy world and they wonât tell me. The whole âI have nothing to hideâ thing is stupid, thatâs a dumb comment,â he says. Whatâs more, your day-to-day behaviour is monitored in ways you wouldnât even realise, so these details and many more could be open for all to see â and use against you. And thatâs a problem, even if you happen to trust your government to use the data for good. Schneier, who spoke at BBC Futureâs World-Changing Ideas Summit on 21 October (see video, above), helped journalist Glenn Greenwald analyse Edward Snowdenâs leaked documents from the National Security Agency. The controversy was recently documented in the film Citizenfour, and consciously or not, Schneierâs sentiments echo Snowdenâs own words in an early email to the filmâs director Laura Poitras: âEvery cell phone tower you pass, friend you keep, article you write, site you visit, subject line you type, and packet you route, is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are not.â (Thinkstock) (Thinkstock) Indeed, pretty much everything you do can be tracked now, says Schneier. âEverything involves a computer. You know that your Kindle tracks how fast you read, right? Everything you do online, everything you do on your phone, everything you do that involves any kind of payment system.â As an example, Schneier told the World-Changing Ideas Summit that things as simple as taxi passenger and fare data could be easily de-anonymised once combined with location data, as the data analytics firm Neustar showed recently. Visit a strip club, for instance, and itâd no longer be private. In general, assume your movements are being watched. Itâs a fact already made glaringly obvious in London, when the local transport authorityâs public bicycle data was unwittingly made public. Individual commutersâ journeys were easily chalked up on Google maps. (Thinkstock) (Thinkstock) Sophisticated smartphone applications are now capable of building up detailed pictures not just of our location, but the context of our environment. In a recent paper, researchers provided the example of an app called CarSafe which is able to learn the driving habits of users by interpreting data from the two cameras on modern smartphones. Schneier also pointed out at the summit that many of the mobile phone towers in your vicinity may not have been set up by your network provider, but governments â both domestic and foreign â who want to find out whoâs walking by and what theyâre up to. The secretive nature of these masts makes it difficult to know how they are used, he says. âThe British government will not even acknowledge that they use them. We know they do, but they wonât even acknowledge that. The FBI does acknowledge that they use them, but is very secretive about how,â he explains. âSomeone found that there are 80-100 of these in Washington DC not run by the US government. We donât know whoâs running them.â Public wi-fi raises yet more issues, since routers that pick up your mobile phone signal are now able to triangulate your position accurately enough to tell which aisle youâre in at the supermarket. If the âMAC addressâ of your device â a unique identification code for your device visible to a network â can be matched to you then whoever has that data might know very intricate details of where you, personally, have spent your time. âIf the government said you have to have a tracking device, for certain you would rebel,â notes Schneier. âBut the government doesnât have to say that because you do it willingly and they just get a copy of the data.â (Thinkstock) (Thinkstock) And so might anyone else. The same vulnerabilities exploited by intelligence agencies could be similarly exploited by corporations, insurance firms, health providers, or even malicious hackers, criminals or terrorists â the very people surveillance is supposed to target. âWe need to choose between security and surveillance,â Schneier told the summit audience. Itâs just not possible to build electronic devices that keep data secret from everybody except, say, government officials trying to track the movements of terrorists. âEverybody gets to spy or nobody gets to spy.â Fundamental rights This is why Schneier argues that people have a right to defend themselves from tracking. That means the right to take protective technical measures, communicate via encrypted systems or browse the Internet anonymously using services such as Tor. But recently the rapidly increasing popularity of such tools has ignited consternation at the FBI. James Comey, the Bureauâs director, has said that encryption offered by companies like Apple and Google deprives law enforcement authorities of information which could be crucial to solving crimes or saving lives. For Tom Gaffney, technical director at information security firm F-Secure, which markets software that protects usersâ privacy online, the comments rang hollow. âEffectively, the government is forcing people down the route of using these tools because of their lack of transparency, their desire to track every bit of our data rather than concentrating on criminals,â he says. (Thinkstock) (Thinkstock) Gaffney also points out that data collected by private companies, whether encrypted or not, can still be held more or less forever, and thereâs no way of knowing for sure how it will be used or sold in the future. The point of recognising all of this is to better understand the consequences of using free services which rely on monetising our data via advertising to remain profitable. And Schneier argues that all government tracking should be legal and targeted to individuals already suspected of criminal activity, rather than having universal surveillance through which private experiences belonging to millions of innocent citizens are recorded and stored. The information we create as we navigate the world, both physically and digitally, is sometimes referred to as a âdata footprintâ. This sounds relatively benign, which is why the term is a poor metaphor. The true data footprint you leave behind everywhere you go and after practically everything you do is much, much more detailed than a trace in the sand.

Honestly, It doesn't even require a MITM attack or anywhere near $2500 to find the source of a tor browser request. Tor is not anonymity, its simply randomization. The end point has to receive in clear text what the beginning point is, and the second ""node"" to speak (first to receive encrypted information), knows exactly who the requester was and received it in plain text. With that being said, they can follow the ""trail"" so to speak right back to the beginning quite easily. That being said, they want to find the person sending/receiving BTC - they determine if they're using TOR - if so, and no more additional protection - boom they've got you. As coindesk pointed out, the attack isn't good enough to actually steal coins - it can only expose the original BTC wallet address (origination point/sender). Coin mixers/anonymizers to my current understanding (and correct me if i'm wrong) but simply work by basically using a multi-sig type token to send all of the coins off-site, mix them randomly, and bring back on-site to unsort. This in a very similar way works like TOR. So yeah basically, they can follow a huge papertrail (HUGE) but they can still do it, back to the source point with clear text. This includes both Tor and BTC. So yeah, Coins over Tor = not fully anonymous. Buyer's are okay to buy coins with cash or bank (mixing is best both ways to add additional security) and then spend them on Tor for the most part - as long as they're not doing anything that would be on the LE's radar. In order to be fully anonymous, other steps/precautions are necessary as well as changes to your browsing habits. Some of these changes include using a VPN/SOCKS5 that doesn't log before connecting to TOR (so that the starting point doesn't know who you are, and neither does BTC). Sellers on the other hand, are going to have a lot harder time combating this. They have BTC to convert into cash/other clean currency. I suppose they could always fully anonymize as much as possible (can never have too much), and then use a mixer, and then send to a BTC address belonging to a wallet who's never had an address used on the darknet.  I suppose there would still be a ""trail"" so to speak, but the beginning node in TOR/BTC wouldn't know who YOU are. I only worry about making it seem like you have a legit source for the funds. I doubt you could get away with ""it was donation"" to many times, or with too large of amounts.  This also brings the new ""Helix"" website by Grams to mind. Obviously no mixers are open source and let us know exactly how they work, but Helix advertisers that you receive coins that ""have never touched the dark net"". Something like this, and a socks5/vpn that doesn't keep logs seems pretty secure. This way, the starting point only knows YOU as the socks5/vpn (and the socks5/vpn doesn't know who you are or what information your sending/requesting - IF IT DOESNT KEEP LOGS). If they truly don't keep logs, even if pressed by LE they literally would not have the evidence to give (connection records, etc). If you used something like Helix rather than a typical mixer (which most have turned out to be scams anyways) your coins are technically ""clean"", even though you may not be able to prove how you got them - they shouldn't have reason to ask. What do you think? I have no idea with dark coin, but would assume its the same.",""

When they find your real IP they may raid your house to get hard evidence because LE knows an IP is not enough to send someone to jail for carding. But LE is smarter than that. They already know that hackers/carders encrypt their drives. So before they raid your house they may perform long/short term surveillance on you and match your IRL activities with your online activities.

Totally remove the password. Routers are rarely checked forensically, and if you've got an open wifi port, you can claim that you have no idea who may or may not have been using it. Even with a warrant, the moment you mention this to police, they're going to say, ""oh man..."" (seriously). Other things to do: Unless they're showing up with a swat team, which is unlikely if you're carder, they're going to knock. When you hear anyone knock at your door or ring the doorbell, shut your computer down. That way, the encryption kicks in, and you're safe. In the event that you do get busted, and they end up with your hard drive, whatever you do, don't post the details like length of your key, or whether you're using mostly numbers or letters ANYWHERE. I don't care how much you're freaking out. The more information you put out there, the more likely it is that LE will get a hold of it.  That said, if you do seriously suspect that LE is on your tail, do the intelligent thing, and stop carding for awhile. Take your winnings, go somewhere nice for a bit. Get your name legally changed too, when you get a chance. This may sound retarded to you, but the police, the courts, and the DMV do not cross check name changes against active investigations, or ever, for that matter. Warrants and summons have to be served in your full current legal name, or else they're invalid. If you change your middle name from Paul to Fred, any summons or warrant would need to reflect that. For best results, change your middle name and move. It will completely fuck up any investigation they're doing on you, if said investigation exists.

"Evolution Forums","mrblahblah","20797","2014-08-20T01:41:02","Question about tablet security","Security & Anonymity","So I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet that I'm considering using for illicit activity. I originally bought it and used it for legit matters that anyone would use a tablet for, so I registered my google account in my real name and payment information for buying apps in the play store. Now I'm thinking about resetting the tablet and creating a new ""phony"" google account. I would only be turning the tablet on when connecting to a public wifi to do my illicit shit. My concerns are a couple. For one, does resetting the tablet SERIOUSLY reset it and delete anything that could possibly link my new illicit account and activity to my previous legit one? I can't name how many times I've heard that restoring PC's doesn't actually delete everything and old data is still left on there. My 2nd concern doesn't COMPLETELY pertain to this as I would be only turning the tablet on when connecting to public wifi's, but it's something that I'd like to ask as having the ability to connect to my own internet would of course be convenient. My concern is that if I used a VPN on my tablet, is there anything that could de-anonymize me? Like maybe an installed app could see the network that I'm connected to and my real IP. Obviously I know that websites that I visit when connected to VPN are only going to see the VPN IP, but I wonder about other things like apps, the browser itself, even the google account connected to the tablet that maybe watches over everything you do on it. Especially if I'm using certain apps for my illicit activity. I would have a concern about them being able to uncover my identity when connected to my personal network since they're actually installed on the device and not just a website that I'm connecting to through VPN or even TOR. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks in advance guys.",""
"Evolution Forums","vaperman","20797","2014-08-20T23:23:57","Re: Question about tablet security","Security & Anonymity","IMO, using anything running Android for illicit activity is risky. I'm no software expert, but what I do know is that there is so much going on in the background it's very hard to secure. If someone custom designed a version of Android that closed up some of the holes, it might be better, but I don't know if there is anything out there like that and it's still risky even if you do. Don't waste your time with it. Watch your porn on it and do your real dirty work on laptop running tails or something along that lines. Regarding a reset, you are correct data stays. It only tells the system to lose the location but the data is still there. The only way you can completely be sure it's gone is to format everything or somehow overwrite the entire storage. Regarding you VPN issue, I'm not sure, specifically but with Android there's probably a 100 ways you can be deanonymized.

At least in the US there are plenty of prepaid anon internet avilable from your target's area, and you can be anon and not worry about RDPVPN,proxies,etc. Make your money and throw it away.

But there is always some help that's needed lol.I'm not sure that this will be the good topic for all my questions. In advance, sorry for my bad english.  I have install virtual box and then the two VM's of Whonix, but when I lauch both of them, I don't know what is the next step. First, do i need to have good ability on linux to use this, or is it possible to follow some guides to have good security?I followed a step by step guide for installation so I think I did everything right. I have the current problem, an error on workstation that's asking me "" did you start whonix gateway beforehand? please run whonixcheck on whonix gateway then restart whonixcheck on whonix workstation "" . In the same time i have a popup of timesync that do not begin (but i have internet connectivity functional)Do you know how I can fix it?  I want a good security to card, and i wonder if the following configuration will be good enough. Need to say that I am a noob so this lacks of details.. I will purchase a prepaid data card for my android, using cash. Then I'll pass by virtual box for Whonix, after that, at a VPN for finally join Tor. I have the free guide of Mountainhigh9 that I will follow, for the other ways to identify me. I guess I am not a big target for LE, but I want to be safe (at least the more possible). Thanks",""

I figured I could post here and see if any wizards out there had an ideal solution. I know there are several methods to change your IP address, and programs or network cards that can change your MAC address as well, but I'm looking for something that goes a bit further than this. Is it possible to be able to have multiple IP and/or MAC addresses on one PC simultaneously, and be able to choose which ones are displayed when connecting to a particular internet service? Websites or internet programs know your IP, and MAC address as well (I think?) when you connect. Sometimes I would like to be able to connect more than once at the same time, while maintaining privacy, and not associating them with each other. I hope my question makes sense. I'm not looking to do anything illegal, but my reasons are private and I would rather not explain them. Hopefully it's ok to ask this question or discuss this kind of thing here. I know you can change your IP address through proxy servers and such, but I'm not experienced enough to know when any web service has access to your MAC address as well, and masking both of them at the same time, and displaying different ones while connecting to the same service simultaneously is definitely outside my range of experience. If there is any tips I would appreciate it   Thanks!",""

"Evolution Forums","JustSomeNobody","22003","2014-08-31T11:29:02","Re: Tor Middle man attacks","Security & Anonymity","Your VPN connection will (presumably) be using encryption for that part of the trip, which may or may not be sufficient.  Supposedly everything but IPsec is broken, but that's just what I read on some wiki one day, so don't quote me on it -- I'm not very familiar with VPNs.  Anyway, Tor basically is a SOCKS5 proxy, so I'm not sure what you mean by VPN->Tor->SOCKS5 ...?  Disregarding the last bit, everything that passes through a Tor exit node will have no encryption after that.  So if you go to www.example.com with your setup, it's encrypted to the VPN, then through the Tor network up to the exit node, but after that there's no encryption.  A malicious exit node or somebody else after the exit node could get in between you and the site you visit without much trouble, yeah. Basically, anything that stays within the Tor network is encrypted, but as soon as you leave it via an exit node (as in visit any site without a .onion address), it's basically the same as it would be without Tor or the VPN (a little worse, actually, since the exit node is kind of by necessity a benign observer).  Does that answer your question?",""
"Evolution Forums","bingobongo","22003","2014-08-31T22:04:31","Re: Tor Middle man attacks","Security & Anonymity","thanks for your Reply.  Kind of, but its created more questions.  By socks5 i mean vip72 for instance. So vpn-tor-vip72 the vpn keeps the data encrypted and passed it on to tor encrypted ( so usually, if using a vpn only, this would decrypt the data once passed through the vpn yeah?) But as its passed onto tor, it stays encrypted. Now from that logic, i would assume if vip72 is then connected to tor it then force encryption past tors exit node and leave the vulnerability of Middle man attacks with the vip72 socks/exit?  Or would it be decrypted and therefore vulnerable on the tor exit node, sent to vip72, re-encrypted and then decrypted again as it progressed to the site?",""
"Evolution Forums","NotSuspicious","22003","2014-08-31T23:11:51","Re: Tor Middle man attacks","Security & Anonymity","Vip72 has encryption as far as I'm aware, this means it is encrypted between you and vip72. Therefore Tor only sees encrypted data and the vpn only sees tor data, so there would be no opportunity for a mitm attack. If I was you I would go tor-vpn-vip72 or take tor out of the equation completely if you trust your vpn. Edit: To clarify, a mitm attack would be possible from the socks exit unless the site you're browsing is https.

I found this out after depositing coins to the fog but have since found a secure way to transfer to Evolution but it comes at a price    (security always comes at a price).  the solution is another mixing service that works fast and is being used with out problems throughout the darknet. http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion is a new mixing service that is almost instant. and it sends all coins at once t to any address you specify. You even have the option to use freshly mined coins that have no history (of course at a fee). So what I did I tumbled my coins in bitcoinfog then sent them to bitblender then sent them to the market place. of course you risk getting stuck with a 6 % fee but for some noobs like me who don't have access to secure completely anonymous wallet just yet its worth it right now. regards,Dicktaster",""

Careful!!!","Security & Anonymity","My friend finally made first purchase after much research from highly rated domestic US vendor a few weeks ago. Did not trust his address for certain reasons so he got a P.O. Box. He made small order from DNM after ordering something on ebay to the box. He's sure he took all security precautions. Well his DNM order is taking for ever and he's tracking the ebay package. Finally ebay says shipped but no package so he goes into post office and ask about it. Turns out they made an error and didnt officially open his box. So box was still in the system as belonging to no one even though he paid for it and got the keys. He's freakin' out and tells the vendor who tracks it and tells him his package has been returned to some random business and to ""clean house"". Package was due at the return address last week but still no word and nothing more in his box. Was definately shitting bricks. He considers box at least burnt. So be careful newbies with that new box. Make sure that shit works before you jeapordize yourself or your vendor!!!",""

No vpn. No vm. No socks,stockings,knickers etc etc. Just a separate pc that you only use for carding. Nothing else. Should the cops/feds come a knocking they wouldnt even find the pc.

Paypal will check your card, and if the card is already linked to another paypal account, you will not only get limited, but you will also burn the CC. Best free method without vpn, proxies... just my opinion. You can actually card from anywhere, you just need to know what you are doing, Lets say the card holders name is on vacation in another country. You must proof that you are the card holders name and is in that country. Go to some internet cafe with your burner laptop 25 miles away from your town. Pay internet with cash. Turn on your Tails OS, change your computer date and time to the card holders country. Uninstall Tor from Tails (Open Root Terminal and run this code. apt-get purge tor. Then type Y), because when Tails connects to the internet, Tor is automatically started. You want to uninstall it to avoid suspicion. Connect to internet and start the unsafe browser. Register your favorite site with the card holders name, age, city, country, etc. The website you want to card should have SSL encryption to avoid eavesdropping. Choose your product, enter CC details, maildrop and you're good to go. I don't know if this method works and is somehow useless for most sites, but it's worth a shot if you are broke or something. It is vital to use anonimity software for carding, If you can't afford VPN service, then Debian + Whonix + Socks5 should be enough. The host OS should be clean (no malware) to run Whonix VM, nothing else. Get the latest version of Debian + Whonix. Then you install proxychains inside Whonix and use Socks5. It's ok to use default firefox configuration on Whonix because somehow cannot leak your real IP address, but you may want to add vanilla to iceweasel. Never use Windows for carding. Use Linux instead.","Xanax2You wrote:Please tell me your honest opinion..

"Evolution Forums","kittendew","30884","2014-11-22T16:51:44","Re: Underkill or Overkill on Anonymity?","Security & Anonymity","The Telnet service is not disabled by default. But it's ALSO not started by default. (and as of Win Vista, the Telnet server service is not even installed.) Since you can only start the service remotely if you have privileged access to the OS, it's a moot point because you'd then be able to do what you wanted without using telnet (which is basically just a pipe to cmd.exe ). At all times you still need to authenticate to the machine as the first step and (as a senior MS tech with almost 2 decades in the field) I'm not aware of a single exploit which leverages a weakness in telnet to that end. I'm sure your ""friend"" did do that but I'm also pretty sure this was on a domain or a LAN where he had the ability to authenticate with known credentials. So basically, your post is technically correct but realistically wrong.  As for telnet being a historical weak point - again, technically correct but misleading. It WAS a weak point because it was originally designed to work without authentication at all. However this was around 30 years ago, and those lessons did not continue to apply equally throughout the next 3 decades, so the history is irrelevant.  These days we SSH, which is simply telnet wrapped in an encryption layer so the traffic can't be sniffed en route. Which, if telnet was still ""insecure"" would mean any *nix user would still be fucked. Which they aren't. And all that applied only to *nix anyway. Windows telnet, being a simple wrapper for cmd.exe, uses the same protocol to send data on the wire - but that's it. Any vulnerabilities that existed in the *nix versions would not apply to the Windows telnet since they're totally different pieces of code. I believe the term for technically correct but misleading data is ""misinformation"".

"Evolution Forums","kittendew","30884","2014-11-22T17:27:07","Re: Underkill or Overkill on Anonymity?","Security & Anonymity","Honestly? It's waay overcomplicated. You seem to be concerned about your laptop being seized by police to such an extent that you worry about data in RAM being read. If this is the case, then your real danger is not related to your laptop. Police will only make themselves known when they already have enough on you that you're fucked. You can be 100% sure that by the time they show up to collect you and your physical evidence, there's already a dossier large enough to convict you. Any more evidence is just gravy for them at that point. That said, a few comments. 1. AES encryption:  yes.  But use something like Serpent-Twofish or Serpent-AES. And for god's sake encrypt your OS drive. And don't use TPM. 2. Your passphrase is the weak point and should be at least 30 characters long. 3. What exactly is a ""burner"" laptop? Why the f*** would that protect you? It's not as if police are going to ask you to pull out a freakin' receipt for the hardware and walk away if they can't find one. In fact using a ""burner"" laptop (secondhand) would be an increased risk as you don't know if it could've been stolen from its original owner. Just buy a regular damn laptop dude. With cash. 4.  VM: yes. Proxifier: no. Fuck proxifier because if you're relying on Tor as your first-level security point, you are sooooo screwed. 5. Here's how I would do it: a) Buy a regular laptop with cash. Get an SSD and not a spinning disk. Drill out the microphone and the camera.b) Install Windows 7 or your OS of choice on the laptop. Install all updates using an offline updater (Heiss' updater for Windows is a good one).c) Install an array of third-party malware programs such as MalwareBytes, and a good antivirus that has a high detect rate and is made by a non-Five Eyes manufacturer.Image the laptop OS in its pristine state to an external HDD. From this point on, never ever connect any device to this laptop that you're not 200% sure is safe. This means no foreign disks or USB keys. No opening Web browsers. No automatic updates. No wireless LAN (use a cable).d) Harden the laptop like a motherfucker (read up on OS hardening and apply it to the limit). Install your VMs. For extra points do silly shit like make the MAC addresses AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF or something.e) Install a VM platform of choice. Both VMWare and VirtualBox are on an equal level here. Install two VMs: one is a Whonix gateway (or pfsense) and the other is your ""work"" VM. This VM will be installed offline similar to the laptop. Instead of imaging it, you'll do a block-level snapshot. Disable loggong on the VM software.f) Purchase two VPN accounts at 2 reputable anon VPN providers that are based in a country which allows them to go log-less (this is harder than it seems). Use a service such as 10minutemail to sign up to each with a disposable address. Use Bitcoin for payment (for fuck's sake only load up your wallet over a VPN or you just traced a payment back to your IP).g) Purchase a number of security cameras. Set these up around your interior and exterior and link them to a PC in your location with a motion alarm, so you can detect incoming.h) Set up a router in your home for regular Internet traffic.i) Set up a router BEHIND this router and have it connect to the first of your VPN providers (i.e. once connected to this router, you will always be running over a VPN).j) Use your laptop on this router only. Load up your VMs and once up, connect to your SECOND VPN provider using that VM.  You now have this VM running a VPN over the top of your first VPN connection (on the router).k) You may now use Tor Browser etc. as per usual.l) Use encrypted containers to store all your data. Back this up to 2 thumbdrives which you plug into NO other computers EVER, and which you preferably store offsite or extremely well concealed.l) When done each time with your VM, you revert it to the block-level snapshot.m) Each week, restore your laptop from your master image. For extra kicks run third-party LiveCDs to check for rootkits.n) Avoid doing stupid shit like using your laptop at a McDonalds or at a hotel. Learn from Defcon's experience: this doesn't make you more secure. In fact it makes you more insecure because there is now a pattern of you accessing X from a number of places you are physically documented to be at.   This will not protect you against the full wrath of Five Eyes (nothing will). But it'll get you to the point that you're pretty much immune to everything other than a concerted global manhunt. In which case your computer security is not your primary concern anyway. Oh, and the #1 way to stay secure?  DON'T POST ON FORUMS.  The more you chat the more identifiable your cadence (the distinct way you ""talk""). This is as unique as a fingerprint and unless you have extensive training you will not be able to hide it. If you chat on Darknet forums and Clearnet forums, it's pretty fuckin' easy for authorities to match your two identities. Yes, it requires that you have an entire copy of the Internet you can search. Yes, this is exactly what Five Eyes has. This was done for DPR during the SR1 bust in fact, and also for Defcon on SR2.  If you want to be active on the Darknet you CANNOT be active elsewhere. No Twitter. No Facebook. No gaming, chat or geek foruming. Ever.

There are exploits that can get administrative access by impersonating a process, to run another process as admin, and it remains unfixed, even in Win8, let alone WinXP. See here: http://www.pretentiousname.com/misc/win7_uac_whitelist2.html telnet is still an issue as to security, BOTH in Windows as well as Unix-based OSs. It has no encryption, are you serious? SSH isn't insecure, but I'm talking plain-text-auth telnet...it doesn't use keys.The same applies to the client, as with the server [both use plain-text-auth] see here: http://windowsitpro.com/security/information-disclosure-vulnerability-telnet-client or http://earthwithsun.com/questions/110760/why-isnt-telnet-enabled-by-default-in-windows-7SSH isn't telnet. It's simply telnet-BASED. it's like claiming BSD/Mac is Linux-based, when it's not. BSD is Unix-based, Mac is BSD-based, Linux is Unix-based, but BSD and Mac aren't Linux-Based, just as SSH is telnet based, but SSH isn't telnet, therefore, telnet, STRICTLY SPEAKING, is INsecure. SSH is another point but irrelevant. Of course, you're supposed to use SSH [INSTEAD OF] telnet: https://catn.com/2010/03/23/why-do-we-use-ssh-over-telnet/   --- still doesn't mean SSH is the equivalent of telnet.

"Evolution Forums","anon2012","16173","2014-07-09T15:33:42","Security 101- Installing Tails LiveUSB with a Persistent Volume -Full","Security & Anonymity","This was taken from SR2. and apparently:This was taken from the original SR forums. I AM NOT the original creator of this post (original one can be viewed here:http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.msg775162#msg775162 ).I am merely passing on the information presented within, as I feel there is vital information regarding the preservation of anonymity and privacy. There is a lot of info out there, I am hoping to consolidate it and present it as coherently as possible here. I feel this is the least I can do to support the cause. All credit goes to Fallkniven (I believe)  Tutorial Part 1 - How to install Tails onto a USB drive.------------------------------------------------------------------- Tails stands for ""The Amnesiac Incognito Live System"". Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly. It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is free software and based on Debian GNU/Linux. Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: the pre-installed software is configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked. Tails is being constantly updated for security flaws - you WILL need to do this all over again soon to stay safe! This comes from the Tails website - ""It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes. The development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known security holes on a regular basis."" You will need 2 x 8GB USB thumb drives (4GB may pass), they are very cheap and available almost everywhere. 1 - Download the latest version of the Tails .iso file from here - remember where you save it (latest stable version: 0.19) -https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html 1a - If you are an advanced user, you can download the cryptographic signature on this same page and then verify the download with the Tails key from here -https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key 2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ 3 - Run the newly downloaded Universal-USB-Installer    3a - Read and 'agree to' the disclaimer    3b - Select ""Tails"" from the first drop-down list, it's towards the end of the list (step 1)    3c - Browse to and select the Tails .iso file (step 2)    3d - Select your USB drive letter (format the drive if its not empty already) (step 3)    3e - Click 'Create' button then wait for it to finish. Will be a few minutes at least. 4 - Restart the computer and boot into Tails from the USB drive (see below for details on Booting from a USB drive) Booting from a USB drive:-------------------------------------If it does not automatically boot to the USB drive, you need to select the boot order, some newer computers will allow you to select which drive to boot to with a small menu, without changing BIOS settings.  You might instead need to edit the BIOS settings, restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive' or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your changes and continue. Many Flash Drives ship USB-FDD formatted and some systems will not detect or even boot USB-FDD. Most systems can however boot USB-ZIP, and or USB-HDD. If you are having a hard time getting your BIOS to detect your flash drive, you can try to format it as USB-HDD or USB-ZIP using the BOOTICE program (or similar).(Caution - this is a very advanced program! Use with caution - follow links for the latest version) http://www.pendriveapps.com/bootice-partition-flash-drive-edit-boot-sector/ For more detailed instruction on how to boot from USB you can readhttp://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/ht/bootusbflash.htm If you have problems accessing the BIOS, read thishttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-access-bios/ I will not accept donations for this tutorial, I offer this only in hope that more people will start using Tor. If you have excess bitcoins you feel like donating to a worthy cause, please send them to Tor or Tails...https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.enhttps://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate/#bitcoin Tutorial Part 2 - Setting up a LiveUSB version of Tails, then an Encrypted Persistent Volume.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  5 - You should now be presented with a log in prompt for a temporary session administration password - this is reset every time you load Tails, it is optional to enter this, it is used to allow current session access to system functions, if you get any errors about access rights try using an admin password at log in. Also at this point you can optionally select to use a Windows XP camo 'skin' to make Tails look more like XP if you're in a public place for example, this is also optional. 7 - Once Tails is up and running, insert the second USB drive. Click the 'Applications/Accessories' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer'.     7a - Click the 1st option ""Clone & Install""         7b - Select your target device from the drop-down menu (your second USB drive!)         7c - Click 'Next', then wait for it to finish (however long to copy about 1gb to a USB drive - usually a few minutes). This will install a new copy of Tails onto your second USB drive, this will be your new proper Tails USB.     8 - Shutdown this session of Tails with the Power Button up in the right-hand corner. Don't forget to take out the FIRST USB you created and BOOT INTO THE NEW SECOND TAILS USB! You can format the first USB drive later on, that copy of tails is no longer required. 9 - Log in to the new Tails USB, once logged in click the 'Applications' menu, then highlight the 'System Tools' sub-menu, then click on ""Configure Persistent Volume"". (The size of the persistent volume is automatically determined by how much left over space is on the USB drive after installing Tails in the previous steps.)     9a - Choose your pass-phrase for the persistent volume - you will need to enter this every time you login to Tails. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a pass-phrase. Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not each time you start Tails. It is a good place to store sensitive materials. When choosing your pass-phrase remember that short, easily guessed pass-phrases are very easily cracked - it would take one Intel I7 2600k CPU over 200,000,000 YEARS to brute-force crack an AES-256 encrypted 32 random character pass-phrase using lowercase, UPPERCASE, 0-9 & ""$p3c|4!"" characters   )         9b - Click ""Create"" and wait for it to finish.         9c - On completion, a window will popup allowing you to select what Tails will save in the new persistent volume automatically, internet shortcuts, PGP keys, nudie pictures, application settings etc... I recommend selecting everything.     10 - Close and reboot with your modem plugged in and switched on, log back into Tails with your new persistent volume.     11 - Make sure your modem is plugged in and turned ON! Click the 'System' menu, then highlight the 'Preferences' submenu, then click on 'Network Connections'. Now, only YOU know what type of internet connection you pay for, I cannot help you with that! My personal internet connection was amazingly simple to setup (i was quite surprised by its pre-configured setups, it has many different countries options for local telcos pre-installed).     Another note - Tails is PRE-CONFIGURED to go through Tor! It is pre-installed with Vidalia and a Torified browser called 'IceWeasel'. It SHOULD automatically open up when connected to the internet. If not, Use the 'IceWeasel' browser menu shortcut to get onto the Road. Also, this operating system is NOT persistent for security measures, meaning that any changes you make (that are not saved in the persistent volume) will not be saved on restarting Tails! Example is Desktop Backgrounds and general GUI appearance settings (if you manage to get these settings saved and persistent, please let us know!)  If you have any relevant information pertaining to this topic, feel free to update and improve upon it. This was a response in the original thread (by Meatgrinder) that I feel is worth posting, using the dvd/usb method as an alternative to the 2 usb method of installing Tails. I did not need 2 USB sticks to make a persistent tails, only 1. I downloaded the tails ISO, burned it to a blank DVD, left it in the DVD tray and rebooted. Booted into tails, hit Applications' menu, then highlight 'Tails', then click 'Tails USB Installer' then clone and install (as directed above) It made the USB stick into a tails bootloader. Once finished, I plugged the USB into my laptop (the above was done on my gaming/media computer) once booted into tails on my laptop, I went back to ""Applications -> Tails -> Configure persistent volume, chose what I wanted, rebooted and it was done (encryption keys, password hashes etc all saved) tried it on my 3 laptops and my brothers too, all working fine with my tails USB as a persistent volume with files I made as a test. Must have done 30 or so reboots to test it.   Installing tails via VM: If you don't have a DVD drive or burner or DVD's to burn, but have access to a virtual machine, you could also install tails to USB using the virtual machine.It would go something like this:1) Download latest tails iso from: https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html2) Create a linux virtual machine and point the cd/dvd drive to the tails iso file3) Boot the virtual machine using the tails iso4) Insert a USB flash drive5) Connect the USB flash drive to the virtual machine: it will disconnect from your computer and connect to the virtual machine instead6) Go to Applications -> Tails -> Tails USB Installer7) Click ""Clone & Install""8) Verify that the correct ""Target Device"" is selected by matching the size of the USB Flash Drive you inserted with what is written9) Click ""Create Live USB""10) Click ""Next""11) Once installation is completed, click ""OK"" That's it! Now you can shut off the virtual machine, and your USB flash drive can boot tails on any computer capable of booting from USBIf you want to configure a persistent volume on a virtual machine, that's also possible! Though I doubt anyone wants to do it once they have the bootable USB with tails on it. If there's any interest, I can post how to do that as well. It's a bit more involved",""

Just the way you just said it.""I ended up telling the cunt to fuck off politely and describe it himself, then I'll confirm. He never replied. Also, he wanted me to send messages to his new pgp key.I have experience with LE and this one sounded just like one with all the typical words they love to use. Just read transcript or watch some DEA presentation and you'll know what I'm talking about.Lots of buyers from Katy, TX for some reason too. Oh, and you got the niggas asking what city I ship from.

A truly good cop would blend in hardcore. If I were LE, I would join the forum and post daily weighing in on topics or answering questions. I would ask questions myself, especially explicit ones like ""anyone know where I can find a hitman to kill a guy that my ex cheated on me with? I want it to be a painful death and am willing to pay good money."" I might even sell on here and build up a rep as a legit vendor. I don't know how far LE would go. Maybe they figure selling a bit of narcotics or even counterfeit money might be worth it in the long run to catch the big fish.

Here is the situationI am setting up whonix OS in a virtualbox whithin a windows host.  1. I configured the browser to be using ""custom proxy settings"" and changing this by clicking the green onion located at the left top corner of the browser, under preferences. 2. I then typed configure the browser's ""network.proxy.socks"" to blank, ""network.proxy.socks_port"" to be ""0"" and ""network.proxy.socks_remote_dns"" to be false. 3. Installed proxychains and configure using command ""sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf"" in this way, remove the ""#"" in front of dynamic_chain, and added a working socks5 proxy under the code # defaults set to ""tor"" socks4  127.0.0.1 9050. 4. Start tor browser by entering ""proxychains torbrowser"" in terminal, the logs in terminal was showing from socks4  127.0.0.1 9050 to the new proxy, then request dns and dns response, and ok blablablabla. 5. Go to several check my ip websites, all of them were showing my ip address to be the new socks5 proxy that I have added into proxychain during step 3, instead of the tor IP. Also all these websites were not detecting that I am using a tor exit node as they've detected before, instead, they are showing a ISP from Canada now. 6. So, I tried to remove the newly added socks5 proxy and left with only the ""defaults set to ""tor"" socks4  127.0.0.1 9050"", and started tor again using command ""proxychains torbrowser"", this time all the IP checking sites were showing that I am a tor exit node user in a middle east or Europe country and blablabla. 7. All the above works are done in the workstation of whonix.   So, here are my questions. 1. Is this finally a Me--> Tor --> Proxy setup? 2. Since the destination website only sees my added proxy instead of tor exit node, and thus DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM USING TOR? 3. Even if the proxychains stop working for some reasons, I would at least still behind the layer of tor's protection for my real identity, right? 4. Am I having any security risks by configuring the tor browser as mentioned in step 1 and 2? 5. As long as I am using whonix, DNS leak is nearly impossible right? Even with this setting? 6, Most important, how can I add another layer by doing Me --> VPN --> Tor --> Socks5 Proxy--> destination website. Is this idea possible and necessary?

For years I was doing a rather minor scam with personal deliveries, don't think more than 200-250Â£ per year.I was a bit afraid to attract too much attention. But now, spending some time in your lively community, I start thinking of doing it a bit more. Only problem is I'm alone, literary and don't have any access to alternative drops. My scam is 100% legit and can't be verified, unless they use GPS or something.So my question to you all is, is it too dangerous to attract too much attention to my home address ? Again bear in mind, there is no way they can prove me wrong. Unless they could start using recorded and ""no signature, no delivery"" approach to all deliveries, even free and fulfilled by Amazon. How much do you think is ""safe"" to scam that way ? 500-1000Â£ per year ?  Thank you very much for your time and posts",""

That would work, but would be very inconvenient. Unless you're using wifi that's within the range of where you live (like a neighbor's or nearby business), but they would have to be close which narrows you down geographically and LE can still pinpoint you. I mean they'll trace the IP which would lead to the neighbor or business, but if they really wanted to get you I think they have methods of seeing who is accessing the wifi and from where.  I thought about how using mobile broadband sticks or hotspots would be good since the IP is just the IP of the tower that you're accessing, but with this method they could of course narrow you down geographically, and then from that point I don't know if there's a way for them to trace where you're accessing the tower from (I think there is because I saw something on TV about how emergency services used the signal of a cell phone reaching a tower to pinpoint where someone in need of help was.) Ya I think that's exactly what people do. They buy BTC with their normal browsers and then use a mixing service to have them forwarded to a wallet that's only accessed anonymously. From there they send BTC to places like EVO. But people talk about how the actual process of buying BTC using localbitcoins is anonymous. I mean I guess when we're talking about the process of depositing cash into a vendor's bank account and then they release BTC to you, ya you'll be anonymous to them, but not LE if you're using your normal browser. And if you're accessing localbitcoins while hidden with javascript disabled to do the deal then you're going to have problems since localbitcoins uses javascript. So in the end you're not really anonymous, at least not to LE. Do all the BTC wallets like blockchain.info not use javascript? I'm thinking they don't. I'm not an expert, so I'm not really qualified to say whether that's safe or not, but my stance right now would be don't do it if you're unsure.

"Evolution Forums","mrwaterhands","12560","2014-06-06T21:01:41","Newbie Guide for Prepping to use PayPal","Security & Anonymity","From Agora: Hey there guys! I will apologize in advance for the amount of reading that is about to follow. I know its a pain in the ass but I cant stress enough how important it is that you follow every rule to ensure the process runs as smoothly as possible. Its also to ensure your safety as well as mine. So get comfy, get a coffee and a smoke and bear with me while I take you on a wonderful journey  Card DetailsYou cant card a card if there is no card to be carded. I bet that woke your brain up didn't it? There are plenty of CC dealers out there who sell all sorts of details. In order for the process to work, you will need the following details:      - Full name      - Billing address linked to the card      - Card number      - CVV      - Expiry dateA contact number is usually optional, but it definitely helps during the verification process. If you know how much is on the card, or even have a rough idea, it will also help immensely. This means we don't have to charge out the card in increments and risk burning it after a short while. Remember we want to get your moneys worth out of the card! PayPal DetailsI am running PayPal tests this week, so this section will be updated when those trials are over. However I would assume the login and password for the account is essential to make the purchase. Paypals are easier to clear as you can check the balance of the account before we begin, then charge it all out in once purchase. I'm not sure how the purchasing of PayPals works, but if you can find out the billing address of the PayPal before you log into it, this will be super helpful later on down the track when we get to âsocks and proxiesâ. E-mail addressesWhen making a purchase, the site will ask you for an e-mail address. This is so it can generate an invoice once the payment has been received, or if there were any problems with accepting the payment. I suggest opening an account with Safe-Mail, Hushmail or GMX as they specialize in security and anonymity. Card ChecksIf you have a death wish, you can always try calling the banking institution of which the card was issued by (if you know it), otherwise checking if the card has been burned or not can be done by signing up with netflix, or trying to make a small donation to charity. If it works, you know the card is good. If it doesn't, well better luck next time. There are vendors out there who claim they can do balance checks for you, however I am uncertain of whether or not this is true. But feel free to try anyways.  MAC ChangerPlease note: This method has been tested by myself on a Windows operating system. There are methods out there for Macs and Linux, however I have not had experience with them. See here for a Linux MAC Changer: https://github.com/alobbs/macchangerA MAC changer is an optional security measure. Its pretty quick and easy to do.  Simply go to: http://www.technitium.com/tmac/Download and install the software, start it up then follow the prompts to select a new MAC address. Try to find something in the area of your CC holders billing address. This helps in the verification process.  Proxies and SOCKS5Please note: This method has been tested by myself on a Windows operating system. There are methods out there for Macs and Linux, however I have not had experience with them.So heres the fun part that everyone loves! People seem to make out that SOCKS and proxies are a difficult thing. Its the 21st century people! Computers do everything these days!  vip72.org is going to be your best friend in all of this. I know you're going to whine that its a service you need to pay for, but you gotta spend money to make money, and quite frankly $3 is a damn good investment for what you get in return. After you sign up for an account on VIP72, simply download the software and follow the instructions. The beauty of VIP72 is it lets you do a geological search of IP addresses. PayPal has a ruthless fraud detection system, that detects whether or not you are using your card or paypal from your own town or not. If your CC victim lives in California, and your computer is telling PayPal you're in Paris, then you're screwed, your card is burned and you leave with nothing. Check the suburb of the billing address of your CC or PayPal, and try to find an IP as close to that as possible. If you cant, then the same state should usually suffice. Once you have the location set and search results obtained, make sure you select your new IP address on the following criteria, Age and Speed. Ideally, you want to find one thats young and fast (like my women). Old IP's mean there is a risk they have already been blacklisted, and Slow IP's mean there is more of a chance of the website timing out and canceling the purchase. System ClockPlease make sure your Computer/system clock matches the timezone of the billing address of your Card or PayPal Internet BrowserI know you guys are probably going to feel naked without it, but unless you know how to edit the proxy settings and everything in your Tor Browser to coincide with your SOCKS, you're just going to break your Tor Browser. Firefox is a lot easier to use in this instance, as it loads the pages quicker, and also looks less suspicious to PayPal. Virtual MachinesAgain an optional security measure. If you know how to use it then go for it, but to be honest you wont really need it, your part in the carding process takes about 2 minutes.  Ok guys thats it! Hope you're still with me! Below I have included an updated FAQ section on the whole process. If you feel your question hasn't been answered, please PM me and I'll do my best to answer it for you. *****FAQ******How does the process work?I have set up an ""online store"" for you to make purchases with your card or PayPal. The money is then taken from the store account, sold for bitcoins which I clean, then send to you. The whole process can take anywhere between 3-5 days But I will keep you informed every step of the way if there are any delays. Does the process involve PayPal?Yes. However you do not need to register an account with them (if you are using a card). Paypal is merely there to process the payment, like an eftpos machine  Do you need my card or paypal details?No. At no point will I ever ask for your card or paypal details. Can you just cash out the card or paypal for me?At this point in time no. There are a few reasons behind this:1. To make sure the process runs as smoothly as possible, I need to be on the receiving end of the funds to ensure I can clear them out as quickly as possible, in case the paypal is frozen. I cant log out of my store, change my MAC, SOCKS and Proxy, process your payment, Change back my MAC SOCKS and Proxy, then log back into my store and move the payment (then repeat).2. My computers don'tt like me running multiple MAC', SOCKS5 and Proxies off the one  internet connection. It pisses them off and shit runs slow. Page time outs can ruin everything.3. You might be LE trying to set me up, and I don't want to embarrass you when I take the money and you cant catch me... Is this a scam?No. If you feel that it is though, there is no need to lecture me on it, so feel free to take your business else where. If this isn't a scam, why are you doing this?Carding is a very risky business, hence why not many people offer the service because they're scared of not doing it right and getting caught. I know I can do it right, So if people want to pay me to assume the ""risk"" for them then I'm ok with that, because at the end of the day, I get my cut and move onto the next customer. Where do I buy cards and paypals from?There are a few vendors on the market who sell Credit Cards and PayPals account. However Ive never bought any off them before so I cant vouch for how good they are. Why do I need to pay you $100?The $100 down payment is a bond of sorts. It remains in escrow until your Credit Card funds have been received. If you feel I have ""scammed"" you in anyway, then the escrow system is a good place to start to have a dispute put in with Agora to get me kicked off the market, plus to get your $100 back. If you think your card is worth more and would like to pay a higher bond, then please let me know. I will not cashout any cards or paypals unless the bond/deposit is in escrow. This is so Agora gets their commission for me advertising on their market. Why are you slow to reply?I live in Australia. I'm probably sleeping if its daytime where you are. Also, I'm doped up on Oxys. Can I have some of your Oxys?No.",""

Even if a house is empty it's hard getting in, nevermind trying to open the motorized gate when the delivery guy pitches up (awkward).",""

I mean yeah you can be hit with time based doxing so that's why we learned not to log into personal accounts at the same time we are doing our thing (also personal info on the same dirty exit IP). We also don't use username's from when we were young and signed up with e-mail accounts(that could have real info) and ip's that could be traced to us. If god forbid they did show up, everything should be heavily encrypted. With no other evidence on hand (which I know is hard and not always possible). In the US they can't force us to give up non physical items such as passwords. Honestly though unless your the top dogs there is probably very little interest in you. There's just limited funds and so many different crimes going on (much nastier and violent ones).

Let's say you took 100K using that bank site. You took it by random amounts, but with same setup. Maybe VPN -> TOR -> VPN -> socks5. First thing first they (the bank) must understand that you are not a group of people, but ONE single individual. How can they do it?Let's say you write a guide and release it here on the market. Know there are other you around that site. How many are try to get money from that site? How the company can know who is who? They call LE. LE comes into the scenario. What LE do when @ PP everyday there are thousands of illegal transfers? They go deeply into each one? I think the victim (PP, bank, website, whatever it is) will simply improve they security checks and leaks. Because if victim will wait LE, victim is really fucked. I'm not saying this to raising arguments... I don't know much about this topic. It's just a legit question i think. We are concerned of sec stuff (of course we are!) but When LE will be really interested in us? I honestly think LE is working more on catching big .onion sites, not a single carder who earns 10K per month.  Setup is: VPN -> TOR -> socks5 when need itHow exactly VPN is able to see what are we doing? They keep log of your activity PLUS they have setup your system to connect to THAT compromised tor exit node?    Setup is: TOR -> VPN -> socks5I don't understand why VPN here is needed. Honestly we risk more to increase our chance of getting our actions logged by VPN? PLUS NOT ENCRYPTED? SERIOUSLY? Better to do TOR -> socks5 don't you think? If you are not sure you can still do VPN -> TOR -> VPN -> socks5 when needed  Or VPN -> Different VPN -> TOR. Honestly I think this is the best.

Tor and vpns are used for diff purposes. Vpn=privacy tor=anonymity.  Your 1st layer is the most crucial, connection! Anybody attempting to do any (keyword) illegal shit should not be using wifi that can be linked to their true identity. With that being said, who cares how u connect (vpn-tor, tor-vpn) as long as ur shit is delivered . #1 key to be and remain anon is to be private, blah blah blah read my posts in security sec. If ur worried tho, I recommend vpn>tor>vpn>(socks/tor/nothing) depending on ur needs. Fresh lap, bootable usb, vm, etc. If ur worried, u can run whonix in vm from bootable usb=no hdd traces. Why? Vpn 1 hides tor from isp (privacy), tor hides ur identity(anonymity), vpn 2 hides ur activities from tor and vpn 1 (privacy). So vpn 1 knows who u are but not wat ur doing, vpn 2 knows wat ur doing but not who u are since ur connected via tor. My point is, if ur just using tor to browse and speak u don't need vpn (optional). (Keyword) hidden services protect u and (keyword) shouldn't log ur fake ip anyway, so ur pretty much safe. If ur carding u cant use tor anyway. Honestly, spoof mac+bootable usb+public/hacked wifi will probably yield best results. Just saying...

Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency, but many people mistakenly believe that Bitcoin is fully anonymous.   The main problem with Bitcoin anonymity is that every transaction is publicly logged by design. Anyone can view the flow of Bitcoins from address to address in the blockchain. This data alone cannot be used to identify you because the addresses are just random numbers, but if any of the addresses in a transaction's future or past history can be backtraced to a real identity, it may be possible to find out who owns all the other addresses. Such identity information could be derived from network analysis, surveillance, or a quick google search for the bitcoin address. If you buy bitcoins using an exchanger, the bitcoins you purchase can be traced back to the exchanger, which may have your real identity information on file, including banking data. All exchanges require the user to scan ID documents, and large transactions must be reported to the proper governmental authority.

Do NOT download TC 7.2. Download TC 7.1a here : https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm -------------------------- Using TrueCrypt 7.1a, the most secure method of encryption is : AES-Twofish-Serpent cascading encryption with the XTS method. Use the Whirlpool hash algorithm. (SHA-512 is a very close 2nd place here. It's debatable. I'm leaning towards Whirlpool because SHA-512 is already having a successor developed because of fears that it is based on an older SHA-1 that has been compromised.) Most important is to use a very strong password. 20 to 30+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols. Use Microsoft's online password checker for a strength test. You can also use keyfiles to further secure your password. You should use the AES-Twofish-Serpent over the Serpent-Twofish-AES because you want the outermost encryption (AES will be the first layer they need to break) to be the most standard in the industry. That one is the most tried and true and the most tested of all of them. Plus, if someone assumes a file is encrypted with AES, there's no way of seeing that is is then encrypted with Twofish... so they do all this work to break the AES, only to find that Twofish stands in their way now. And then again after Twofish they run into Serpent, which is the biggest beast of them all (even though it is less used / tested than AES, it still has a much higher security margin than AES) If you do use Keyfiles, have TrueCrypt create 3 keyfiles for you. Create one keyfile for each hash algorithm they provide. You might also add some .jpg's and some .mp3 files as well. You should make sure to make each keyfile read-only. ______________________ arcana.",""

Does any one have any familiarity with shipping to a UPS private address?  Also do you think it would be safe to ship about a pound per trip to a UPS private address(assuming seller is good at stealth).Are there any precautions I should take besides not signing for anything/ Not picking it up for a week or 2?

And UPS asks you to pick shit up within 5 days otherwise they get mad about it or charge you extra fees and I think after a certain amount of days they will just send it back.

My first question is can i use this OS for online anon and secure operations. Making it dual boot on UEFI with Linux Debian is a pain in the ass.  I also want to keep using my laptop for private open usage. Or is that a no/ no ?  My computer skills are quite good. Its just putting the pieces together.  What i have so far:  Windows 8.1 laptop VPN PIATOR browser  I tried using tails via USB and running the bios in legacy mode.  If i say a lot of stupid things here above just tell me, just want to get to learn the trade and get experience :-)  Hope you guys have some good tips. Anon1612",""

It is the most widely used, thus the most attacked and riddled with issues.  If you use Tor at home your ISP can see that you are, which may be regarded as suspicious. Best practice is to always use an access point unrelated to you. Once you create a second USB with tails on it, made from the first USB using Tails Installer, you must create a persistent volume.  Tails USB through a laptop using public WiFi should be enough to keep you safe. If you want to go the extra mile, set up a burner laptop paid in cash, have no internal hard drive or one with only a Linux OS that you use for NO personal info or activities. Spoof MAC, HD serial, use public WiFi, Tails, TrueCrypt, VPS, SOCKS5.",""

Most of the payments I accept are from obscure or odd transactions, very little or no detection whatsoever related to fraud, many are sent weeks after a transaction is done -- and have only seemingly a few random 'deposits' from moneypacks. However recently I tried opening a Second GD account, concurrent with my first, which is legal and acceptable by GD, not even for fraud necessarily, however My SSN was 'rejected' - and it was not allowed. I then tried Netspend, 'GoldPremier' Vanilla reload, 123rewards - and every time I tried to verify a permanent account, it said denied again and again. I even called with a new GD card on the phone with an agent, who transfered my information EXACTLY from my current GD card over, and it was denied showing apprently the SSN was blocked. I have pretty good 'credit score' yet i dont even think these companies take this into consideration.So this is somewhat of a warning to me and maybe anyone else experiencing this that it means one is on some kind of 'radar'.I posted earlier about an encounter with possible LE related to something in Vegas, but had nothing whatsoever to do with any MP - went back and searched all deposits, the few I had were not traceable for 'fraud' - I was doing more 'large scale' operations over several months, and were not related to MP, but somehow have put me on watch somewhere with my real SSN, thus being blocked.  I dont know if anyone has experienced this, but this is alarming if someone has my SSN 'blacklisted' and if its not from 'credit' then its definately higher LE. Something to keep in mind if your being blocked they might have you ons ome kind of 'radar' - possibly.
