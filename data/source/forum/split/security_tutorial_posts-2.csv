Pretty much manipulating people by words, body language, reverse psychology, pretending to be somebody you're not, etc, to get what you want. And usually the best hours are in the late afternoon - evening. So for you if there's a 6 hour difference I would recommend you do this around 10AM - 2 PM.  There will always be some vendors that are hard but depending how far you go with the method you can be guaranteed to get your item. If the vendor is saying the item is currently not in stock (as baffietaes said) it's very likely that they are back ordered and truly aren't in stock. The greatest thing about this method is that it costs no money, so you can do this as many times you want and you're bound to have x amount of successful operations.  If you're ever talking to a vendor and get stuck you can message me and get some help with what to do.","obpulsive2 wrote:What does SE stand for?Well I tried and failed but it gave me experience for next try - I tried for a phone (can't go into too much info).  It knocked my confidence a bit.Also, I am wondering what time would be best to phone from UK as china is six hours ahead (well generally but probably depends what part of china) so I found myself doing it at 3am so it would be around 9am there.  I suppose 10am here-4pm there."

People to trade Amazon orders done for them for BTC or other currencyPeople who sell BTC for Amazon GC'sOr any other 3rd party    All i needed was some investment (you get back after the 1st sale) which can be any amount so please   do not ask me about amounts you need to invest because it all depends on how much you want to see in   return, but the best thing about this method after the 1st few cashouts, i was able to just have profit profit and   more profit, without having to reinvest and best of all, it was 100% clean money.  A full guide written by me which teaches you how to turn ""Amazon refunds"" into a full working business (on the clearnet)Full Amazon refund tutoringPlus a lot more Tips & Tricks    To all people who purchased my PayPal guide it is not one of the methods in the guide, this is an entirely different   method i have been using for the past month, the reason for selling is simply this method could not be saturated   so why not share the love ? lol

I have read over, yet to implement, will be putting in place the systems required over the coming days and will hopefully see a ROI within 3-5days from today. This guide to date is the best one I have recieved. Easy to read, easy to understand and very well written. Vendor has stepped this out making it easy to understand. It's a great method, but what's even better is the way it is written. No guess work needed. It's all there. I may have a few queries once implementing but have no doubt this very very helpful vendor will be available to assist. This method and guide would be great for someone who is entering into the fraud world and doesn't have as much knowledge on carding etc. Its a great entry level method to help build confidence and skills required for other avenues. I take my hat off to this vendor for once again providing an A+ service. For anyone with limited btc to invest. SPEND it with this vendor safely knowing he is the real deal! Thanks again Mountain High. I will update feedback once I have had a week to test and see ROI.",""

I looked at it and I can give you a fast review. -Level: I would say that this is an easy method as you can outsource the refund process to any vendor here, and the refund is the only hard part.-Security: Very simple, just Virtual Machine and VPN. Remember that this is not as dirty as carding or anything like this.-Investment: You need to invest about...100$ (this is probably the minimum)-200$ + the amazon credit/gift-card/money but you will get this back with the refund. +this guide-Money earning: You can earn money with this, this is one of the simple ways to get money.-Earned money: You will earn clean money, but you still need to clean the money to get it yourself. But it is clean money so that will never be a problem or hard.  -Cons: Spelling mistakes, high cost for the guide, nothing ground breaking.-Pros: Easy, clean, good beginning, doesn't need that much time per day (as much or as little as you would like) but you still need to login in every day as you are running this but you can stop when ever you please. Summary: I will use this method my self, it is not a revolutionary idea or anything ground breaker. You can earn money with this easy, and I really recommend this for beginners as this is so much easier than carding or anything like this. As for you guys that are not beginners, this is still a way to earn money, simple and clean. 8/10 , simple but the price is high for the guide, but you will earn it back within a week. My recommendation is BUY.

I have also baught MH9's Fuck Paypal guide and after reading the 2 went for a little tutoring course with the man himself, there are alot of slack vendors out there who sell the same old recycled methods and after wasting a couple of hundred on them I have now found 1 of the best teachers on Evo, seriously no need to go anywhere else, in the past week my brain has been stormed with so many fucking ideas its making me crazy, this guy will turn you into a money magnet. I have just got everything ready and will be putting it into action this week, big respect to MH9 for putting up with my countless newb questions and patiently guiding me through the set up process. I will update this week with my progress",""

MH9 manages to make a plethora of information and methods easy to read and comprehend without being to overwhelming. With this guide, you can most definitely expect to make plenty of income once you're up and rolling. The idea, setup, and application are all very clearly detailed in the guide so even someone brand new to this type of activity will be able to understand it without issue. If you're looking for a good place to start with fraud, or are looking to augment your current income with Amazon, I would highly recommend purchasing this guide. MH9 is an excellent vendor, teacher, and overall person, so you can feel comfortable that the information he's offering will set you on the right path. I will be reviewing v2 when it comes out shortly, so expect a detailed review on the new version soon.",""

I can say that this one has a unique take on the concept. And an extremely clever one to boot. It is expensive and you'll have to decide how seriously you want to take the whole thing. I suspect for those that just want to do the odd refund because they can or just to make a few dollars, then this guide is probably unnecessary but for those that want to create a real income stream it's all you need. His customer service is great too and he has a nice friendly attitude. There are a lot of twats on EVO but MH9 isn't one of them.

Plumsauce mentioned some good ones there. I had good luck with vpntunnel as well.I'd do some extensive research before committing to any provider as your mileage may vary. Just my two cents. Most, if not all paid services will walk you through setup. Although on TAILS you may have to re-enter the configurations each time you boot up, as everything is wiped upon shutdown.

It is naive, at best, to trust any VPN service that you do not run yourself to not log or roll over on you. While VPN providers like Mullvad may claim that they do not log (and very well may not), don't forget that Mullvad is run by humans who have the basic instinct of self-preservation. Sorry, but if you become the high priority target of formidable adversary with leverage in their country of operation, your measly ""dirt cheap"" subscription is not going to stop Mullvad from complying...and I don't care what their publicly facing/marketing policy states. A VPN is an important component of a good security setup, but there must be other failsafes and crucial opsec steps taken.

Your IP is still visible in the logs. Presuming:- the VPN provider really does not store logs.- you are a high-valued target.You can get tracked via any of the spy programs (prism,xkeyscore etc.) and no onex  will ask the provider itself. Seeing an ongoing OpenVPN (fingerprinted via DPI) to the VPN server address, timestamp it with posts, jabber, icq messages (does not matter with or without OTR), they will see where it comes from and come to your door. Of course, they will not say they used such resources but do parallel construction in conjuction with physical surveillance (which you most likely lack the skills to counter).Always use TOR before connecting to the VPN provider so that only tor exit node servers are seen in the logs (if any).DeSnake, for DNM activities, what are your thoughts on the following setup:Linux host os running Whonix virtual workstation/gatewaySpoofed MAC address on open public wifiVPN (purchased anonymously with BTC) --> TOR (via torified whonix gateway)And more generally what are your thoughts on TOR over VPN, assuming VPN is always accessed from a public AP with spoofed MAC and constantly changing locations? This is a controversial topic, I know. Using a VPN kind of introduces an unnecessary permanent entry guard...making one much more trackable via prism, xkeyscore, etc as you point out."

"Evolution Forums","Z0l4f","36034","2015-01-15T17:51:07","Re: {Revered Guide Maker} Vobinator's Master Guide to Cracking Sites","Guides Vendors","My official review: Overall the guide is worth the purchase. Do not be fooled though, if you think you are just going to be able to start cracking sites right away and making phat monies, you will be disappointed. This will take work on your part, and time.  The only issue I have with this is the price. It's steep for what you get. A lot of this information can be found on some of the clearweb cracking sites, and also a lot of the info is given away for free. On to pros and cons. [PROS]If you know nothing about cracking sites, this is definitely for you. If you don't want to take time to learn how to use the tools properly, this is for you. If you want an automated way to check your combolists, this is for you. Learned of a new site that I didn't know existed, and it pretty decent for what you get. You can monetize on this pretty easily by selling accounts, and hopefully once the Amazon method gets fixed, you can start ddipping to drop addresses and refunding once you hit big Many different accounts to check. I snagged some Newegg accounts, pretty fun.  [CONS]Does not include any working Sentry configs (important for new users, not used to the tool). Does not include a way to crawl for email or user:pass combos. Does not include a way to scrub your own proxies. Is not very detailed for using Sentry correctly, or teaches you how to debug or create configs. Pricy.  [Requested features]Include Sentry ConfigsInclude tools like morCrawler or EZLeecher to scrub combos. Include Proxy CheckerInclude graphics (get with me if you want me to help re-write your document to include graphics) Also, you claim to offer support via ICQ and PM, but you rarely answer.  Score: 7/10 This is not meant to offend you in anyway, I am giving my honest and upfront thoughts about the method. I went into this knowing a little bit already and didn't learn much, but I am overall happy with the purchase.",""

You have not released the QUAD update? Then why is the title of the thread... ""{MostReviewedGuide} GODLY Amazon Guide by Vobinator! Quad dips out! "" You're full of it right now man. I've given you an opportunity to make good. Used your combolist, nothing. Your guide is not a masters guide. I could share a clearnet guide that I found afterwards that has more information on sentry mba.  I'm trying to be cool, but you aren't handling business. All you are doing is marketing and playing damage control. fake glowing reviews from users with 2 post, ignoring PMs. I already gave props for your amazon guide. I'm not a liar. I have no need to, or interest. But I'd like to at least make some money from this shit you call a masters guide.  You advertise amazon, but it's not working on the site you advertise. The private site you gave me produces no results either.  For $175 I'd expect something. Guess I should move on.

Firstly I had no experience at all at cracking. Do I now feel experienced at cracking? No. Have I managed to use the guide to obtain an e-mail/password to certain websites? Yes ZOl4f has posted a great review above and I agree with it. The guide focuses on two ways to crack, the first is a link and fairly basic way to crack a site, this I've had some success with, but nothing as yet that I'm going to make Â£ from. The second is a a little more difficult and I've had no success with however as stated in ZOl4F review, it does rely on having Sentry configs and good user/pass lists. The guide does provide hints and tips and how to try to source these but I feel it could be extended further on how to do so. It is useful for beginners and is a useful read, however since purchasing the guide I have seen that much of the info is available on the clearweb.",""

""Low level"" members doesn't automatically mean bad reviews. Poor judgement is.If i wanted to sell my own guide, and give my vouch copies to the same people, askingfor vouches in every damn thread, i would invest time to see if their reviews are actually good. For all i know, these are the people leaking and killing the actual method. Their poor reviews will only damage the vendor's status. Why are you concerned about getting vouches in the furue? Invest in yourself. Good information deserves the price tag. You must have a busy ""testing"" schedule. I've seen you asking for vouches in a lot of topics.When you ask for a vouch copy, you know the OP wants you to test it right? Sometime soon, aint reallyfair towards the Vendor.  Lets say. The next time you ask for a vouch, say it like this: ""Can i have a vouch copy, i will test it sometime soon"".Chances are you aint getting the vouch copy. So what you are saying is, the guide is incomplete. Not giving or pointing buyers towards the right resources is like writing a step-by-step guide on how to use google.  I share that opinion. A users post count doesn't say anything. Vendors should pick out the right people, doing their reviews. Check out their early reviews, etc. This makes the DW community better, for it is now a broken thing.","awesomepp wrote:Man why gets the OP so much hate?;Void_Draw wrote:I am planning on testing the guide sometime soon.

Bullshit)I think (without heaving read the guide), if the OP adds a section where he tells how to find the informations on the cardholder, this guide would definitely be worth the $50 (even if its hard to set a price on infos you already know).BUT if you guys would stop hating for one second and start thinking out of the box you would soon recognize that you are not only able to card WU with this informations, butalso are able to e.g. open US Bank accounts and EVEN fund them with the cardholders CC, cause they follow very similar security questions.If I remember correct Ozzyz is selling an ""How To Open Bank Accounts""-Guide for $75, so I think $50 is a really fair price."

It just doesn't make sense that they would do this for personal use drugs (in the US). I would be surprised if there weren't LE accounts which sold lots of personal use stuff, never busted anyone and now only sells quantity and busts the buyers. If you bought a commercial amount of drugs from the Darknet and were busted for it you wouldn't find out how they caught you for several months. At that point in time you would probably have very little interest in accessing anything like TOR or coming back to the message board to tell all about your bust - point being that they could continue an operation such as this without it being reported on for a very long time. I would be terrified to order quantity this way. I'd need a LOT more security than I use today that's for sure.","gastroz wrote:Out of curiosity ... couldn't LE:1.

Set up surveillance on larger targets to collect additional proof *they* are the ones doing the ordering. 5. Then do a sweeping round-up of buyers?These conspiracy laws are probably the worst humanity has ever invented. Ironically they came from the land of the brave.

I doubt it would ever be a justifiable defense. LE will literally talk you into doing something, encourage and convince, provide you with any help necessary (e.g. materials), then when you have sufficiently committed to doing it - bust ya. Not in all cases, mind you, but for high profile stuff that is how they operate. Of course, you must admit, we live in a new age where there are real threats out there. They are just trying to keep us all safe. On a vendor as LE, they get a bunch of addresses to watch at the least. On lower level druggie stuff, for local LE, they can even sell you stuff, then buy it back from ya, and charge YOU with dealing. Whatever to make the strongest case they can against you. It's a scary world. LE budgets are higher than ever. Militarized. They have to justify that with arrests. Doesn't matter if it's the 'right' person. Doesn't matter if it's fair. Doesn't matter if they destroy another life. They know they won't win the war on drugs, so they just have to bust someone. That's why I don't have the balls to do illegal shit, even if I think it's something that should be legal. I know what the system does to people. It's disgusting. Once you're in it, nobody looks at you as a person anymore, you're just another number - another case - and extenuating circumstances don't mean jack. Everyone here should be cautious. Keep your opsec 100% tight. Probably that won't matter, but at least it'll help. Best probably is not operate at all.

That means all those that continue to send their shipping info in plain text (and other violations) OR those addresses acquired during prior busts. There are real technically naive people joining now, often making newbie misakes, or not even caring at all about opsec. I'm new too, but like to think I'm different. THESE are the people they will do a big round up of, the general public that doesn't have the tech skills to have decent opsec, and are too naive to realize just how draconian the penalties are (at least in many parts of the world). And that's all it will take to accomplish their goals. Bottom line though, these 'what ifs' can drive you insane. I have mad respect for those that can do this type of stuff and keep their cool. I wasn't born to be a 'smooth criminal'. I think the Darnknet Markets, in one form or another, are here to stay. So is LE. I hope that everyone else remains safe, and free.

The guide might be confusing to a complete newb, I wouldn't call it total noob friendly, however it is easy to follow and the whole thing can be done in about 3 minutes, from the moment You get all the tools on point. This stealer MIGHT steal something, but it needs spreading. And spreading is pain. If You are willing to bare the pain, I rather recommend setting up a rat or a botnet as it's way more profitable and fun. But then You need to crypt it (preferably FUD) and that would cost something. To sum things up - This is bitcoin stealing for noobs. The Guide - 4/5 (could be more noob friendly)The program - 3/5 (I saw that You are twisting it, so it might get better)  PS.

I would like to keep you updated on the development process. As I stated recently a few times, right now I'm working on address similarity, meaning:   if the target's address is something like this:   14Dhs1bNFEzidY5V1YrVyvYW1jszT5oFUD   your will be something like this:   14DhsByi63GfXwFRsxdPh8rAh8rAh8rAUfXD At first I wanted the software to generate the similar address real-time, when the target clicks copy, but then I've realized, it'll be much more effective, faster, if you generate a bunch of addresses in advance, then our software will only choose the most suitable one from them.I've already implemented this solution, however I've been struggling recently on checking the balances of 100000+ addresses.There are two path, I can take here. The first is to download the blockchain and check it. It is not a very appealing solution. I don't want anybody to download the bitcoin blockchain (right now 20GB+ and it's growing). So I have to use some API, some blockchain indexer. The problem is, they're not really let you to request 100+ balances in a few secound, but if they do, they do not let it anonimously. So right now I'm going from library to library and hoping if I can find one that let me do it.If I can't find, I think I will have no other option, but make you download the blockchain.

I'm hacking, scamming and boring since 2007 and now I'm about to make up-to-date, quality products, softwares only for profitable scams and hacks, make tutorials for them and make it easy-to use for everybody. It is an easy-to-follow, comprehensive, step-by-step guide. If you follow this you will never have to worry about finances again.The guide is based on a malware that watches Windows clipboard for Bitcoin addresses and replaces them with your own, this way the user will send the coins to you by mistake. This is an advanced, tested, professional hacking (more accurately phishing) method. This is the first (and right now the only) guide that makes it possible the first time for an average person to use this classic and effective the method. This software is unique, developed by me. The reason why this method is not being used by the average Joe is because you actually have to hardcode your btc address into the program and then build the project by yourself.The good news are, if you have the source code and clear instructions, it is not difficult at all.The package contains the source code (C#) of a malware (BITCOIN STEALER 3.1) that watches Windows clipboard for Bitcoin addresses and replaces them with your own.Also there is a trick that makes your bitcoin address looks similar to the copied address...For example, if the target's address is like this:1JRCnFwbr4wwtzGJ1gkqpVgwCZg9MSwdJEYours will be like this:1JRCfyjr1yvZzH9JuoEYZyYY5tWconhyhpgIE An other advantage of having the source code is that it keeps you safe (from me), because you can revise it yourself, also you can trust it has been revised by others many times before. This guide also will show you how to use this software effectively. The package will show you the social engineering and phishing methods in order to reach your goal.Your only goal is to make the targets to run your exe and from there you can lay back in the rest of your life, go to Malibu and watch the money flowing in. This guide is NOT for you if*you want to invest your money into illegal activity*you want to take risk This guide is for you if*you are average person, who wants to make easy money*you are an average techie, who wants to know how to use an advanced hacking technique*you are a programmer, who need the source code of a masterpiece It is important to know, the developement of this software is continious. As itbecomes more and more powerful tool, the price will raise simultaneously. Well,I have good news for you. If you buy this product and then contribute to itsforum topic you'll get the next version for free, you don't even have to buy the price difference. All you have to do is to send me a pm with alink to your forum post when you notice a new version is out. Hold my hands, I'll make you rich!

I just want to tell you guys since this is an ongoing project, so it's constantly being developed and I don't want you to pay twice when a new version come out, I've figured I'll give the new versions out for free to anyone who bought and somehow contributed to this guide here in this forum topic. Since Evo doesn't store sales more than 2 weeks, it will be the only way to keep track if you've bought the guide before or not. One more benefit of getting it early is that, I'll keep the price rising, as significant improvements happening but you'll still get it for free when the price is higher later. All you have to do is to send me a pm with a link of your post when you notice there are new features in the product.

I appreciate any kind of information/tips that you can share with me. |o| ""11 Hacks to Increase Your Email Open Rates The grim reality of email marketing is that very few people actually pay attention to the messages they receive.  Email is the primary mode of communication for so many businesses that an opt-in just doesnât have the value it once did.  100 people might claim they want your newsletter, but when it comes time for the mental investment of opening it and reading whatâs inside, maybe 5-10 of them actually do. 1. Make sure your newsletter looks good. The idea behind this hack is that, when a user signs up for your  mailing list, theyâre going to open the first message you send.  If they open that message and they discover a newsletter that looks broken or skewed, theyâll figure your message is broken in some way.  Maybe theyâll let you know, maybe theyâll just delete the message.  Either way, that bad experience lingers, and the next time a newsletter comes by it languishes in their inbox. You can test your newsletters using Litmus, to see how it will look on various platforms, including mobile.  Litmus will also tell you if something in your message or subject line will trip spam filters. 2. Keep your subject lines short. According to a survey presented by Salesforce, your email open rates will almost definitely be much higher when your subject line is short.  A subject line under 10 characters is enticing enough to give you a nearly 60% open rate on average.  Chances are this is well above what you typically experience. What can you do in ten characters?  You only have two or three short words to play with.  Fortunately, short language is enticing on its own.  In a world of subject lines that run long enough to be truncated, a short subject line stands out.  It almost doesnât matter what you write. 3. Use title case capitalization in your subject line. Use-title-case-capitalization-in-your-subject-line Itâs much more attention-grabbing to use title case â that is, Capitalization of the First Letter of Each Major Word â in your subject line than it is to use a standard sentence.  Treat your email subject line in the same way you might treat the title of a blog post for your rich snippet.  While a subject line should be short, it doesnât have to be, and a compelling question can break the length rule and maintain a high open rate. 4. Send and send and send again. Whenever you send out a message, track who opens it and who doesnât.  Anyone who doesnât open it should be added to a new list of people you can target again.  If they donât open your  message, itâs as though they never saw it in the first place.  It might be buried in their inbox, they might have deleted it without thinking or it might have ended up in an archive.  In any case, you can safely send the email a second time, potentially drawing quite a bit of additional attention.  You may not want to send a third time, however; the rule of threes lends extra potency to a third dismissal. You might like:How to Turn Your Mailchimp Subscribers Into CustomersHow to Turn Your Mailchimp Subscribers Into Customers Your mailing list, as powered by Mailchimp, is one ofâ¦5. Proof your message, and have someone else do it. When you spend a lengthy amount of time working on a single project, you grow a sort of mental blindness to its flaws.  Your mind fills with the concepts and thoughts behind each word you write, rather than what you write itself.  In the end, you might end up with a message you think is perfect, with a prominent typo you keep missing.  Enlist the aid of someone, it doesnât matter who; just someone who will put a second pair of eyes on the piece and proofread it for you. 6. Satisfy the subject line. The point of a subject line, at least a good one, is to stir thoughts in the reader.  Your goal is to make them ask what could possibly come as a follow-up from that subject line, with the promise that the answer is inside the email. That means you need to live up to your promise and follow up on your subject line in the message itself.  You canât draw in attention with one concept, only to disregard it in the body; itâs a bait and switch that leaves users disappointed. 7. Invite replies. Invite-replies Hereâs one thing you donât see every day; âIf you have any questions, feel free to respond to this message.â  Most emails from large companies are sent from automated accounts that no one checks.  Users are used to needing to find your contact information on your site if they have a question, and thatâs too much work.  It means a lot of questions go unanswered.  Instead, open up your newletter as a two-way communication.  Even if you then forward the replies you get to your customer service email address, youâre still giving users a direct route back to you. 8. Use bright, colorful buttons for your CTA. Your call to action should be preceded by a question, and it should take the form of a bright colored button.  Users tend to gloss over plain text links in their emails, just as they do on your landing page.  And, just like your landing page, you need to optimize your CTA in the newsletter.  After all, itâs the newsletter that helps funnel traffic to your landing page. 9. Segment your newsletter mailing list and test variations. Split testing isnât just for ads or landing pages; you can split test your newsletters as well.  Segment your audience into groups and send variations on your message to each.  Try to keep representative groups if youâre testing general changes, like tweaks to your subject line or the color of your CTA button.  You might skew your results if you segment by demographics to run your tests. 10. Donât forget the other messages you send. When a user decides to download your white paper or ebook, do you send them a confirmation email and thank-you letter?  If so, you might be missing out on a great opportunity.  Consider that content delivery message as a chance to include more hooks for future actions, both in the immediate short term and the long term.  Thereâs always something you can encourage the user to do to support your brand. 11. Maintain a consistent voice. Users feel like theyâre interacting with an impersonal, robotic corporate face if they receive drastically different messages from different marketing channels.  If their experience with customer service is much more casual, how are they to trust that itâs not some outsourced company doing the work?  A consistent voice allows them to trust your business that much more. ** the text above were got by a clearweb blog",""

Eg, if the target's address is this:1NvJCYn4YVMytZtjxckS9y7mibJTF2hNcjThen your address may be like this:1NvJdandYWTs6UXLyc6H52R8e43NSVcj As you can see, this will make the software extremely powerful and effective. Just to reiterate: when a significant improvement is utilized to the guide, I raise the price. If you has already bought an earlier version and contributed to this topic in some form, you don't have to buy the price difference or the whole product again.

I tried to make this pack from Newbie Level to Intermediate and i think everything is going ok for now. Thank you again for your kindly great feedbacks! Here's my some of very recent feedbacks.  ******************* 5th Update of package is coming soon. This time, i've focused Paypal and Amazon refund basics more than others. Update will contain, [+] A mini package about paypal's mechanism includes your lots of  ""how to"" question. More than 5 pdf's and each of them is about page of 15. Complete detailed package for paypal beginners.[+] Amazon refunding techniques and some SE ideas/methods & helpful scripts- receipt generators / Refund chat transcripts etc. (i've already added a *HOT-NEVER SEEN ON EVO* tutorial into my package on my 4th update and i want to continue this kind of stuff because of anyone have an idea for Amazon Refunds with cheap price.[+] Experiences & warnings and ways to increase your success rate on semi-clean paypal transfers. (This is a self written tutorial by me. I signify some effective tricks for increasing your success rate on semi-clean transfers.)[+] Some new websites for your fraud actions will add on to my pack's old documents. Some editing and revisions will do. It's good for searching sources.[+] Lots of other stuff about carding / opening bank accounts for free / finding right sources- fake documents for SE'ing stores / making money guides and more. Update is almost finished, and i'm planning to publish it soon. It takes lots of my time because, i'm also trying to find additional info's for my other services at my routine day -ex. U.S Personal Fullz. And it's really hard to organize, edit more than 75 main pdf, tons of additional pdf. Because i want to create a category scheme for this huge pack. For example, i want separately to edit,  - Hot and still working private methods *never seen on evo market before*- Paypal methods / Paypal  - SE ideas/methods like Amazon refunding.- Carding strategies- Sources/Websites for new carders- Cashing out strategies. etc. I can't decide about category scheme's sub-titles because it's really a big guide pack and i have to think more about this on my free time. My only wish is create best package with this fantastic price and a  [still $25 and will be so for lifetime] Meanwhile, i'm still seeing that some of tutorials in this guide pack selling for ex. $10, $8, $5 on market one-by-one but i think everyone going his own way and i can't do anything for this. I'm only concerning about my some of private guides or self written tips/tricks which includes in to my package. i've already seen that some of them start to selling for high prices and separately! If this continue to go this way, i absolutely will think again about my lifetime-subscription policy for my updates. i've never want to jump my price or to prohibit updates to new customers. My future plans for this package is really impressive for dear evolution members. At summer, maybe i publish my 25th update and want to grow this package for everyone to use (newbies and experienced carders) with valuable tutorials. I'm experienced at webmaster stuff in my other ""legal"" life and still searching for making fake stores (never saturated quickly), SQL'ing tryings for my local stores etc. i just want to create/collect/add easily understandable guides for you which will give direction to your carding survey. So, my price always will be same but i just don't want that people abuse this.  Anyway see you soon friends.  * My delivery time is nearly instant unless i sleeping or going for outside. (Check feedbacks please)* All of my customers still can benefit package's updates FOR FREE. This is an lifetime sale.* Never pay more for single tutorials! This amazing and booming list will continue to grow. Thank you for all your kindly feedbacks and trust. I wish happy weekend for all Evolution Community.

"Evolution Forums","yummy5656","2509","2014-05-02T20:17:38","Re: [UPDATED 03/02] YUMMY'S HUGE Guide Pack + SUPPORT","Guides Vendors","Hello Cypher, thanks for your comment but this is not apply for my guide pack. But you're right in just one point. Yes some of tutorials on evolution market are really old and useless, even so, their price expensive. But you can't say this for whole tutorials on evo market. Every vendor has his own way/own policy for selling. logically, imho, there are two kind of ""guide"" on dark net markets. One of them is collected guides or guide packs and the other is private/never seen or self-written guides. Of course nobody can't claim that ""you can earn $10k with a guide which priced at $5"" If somebody want more easy money, he/she have to pay more for a private detailed step-by-step guide. Collected guides are very useful for especially beginners. They could give very very good viewpoints to them. i'm selling a huge guide pack for $25. My goal is, i'm always trying to make updates for my pack. i add some very valuable tutorials in it which are selling alone for prices like $20. and for last, i always try to help my customers. You can check my feedback, if u want to see a proof. i want newbies can collect these informations with a cheap price and start their fraud adventure without scammed.There are lots of paypal or fraud ideas in my guide pack which are still working (never chance saturate) But as i said before, i can't do more with this price. if anyone want to buy very private tutorial or a guide focused on just ""X subject"" have to pay more friend. For example, i'm selling a private paypal method but it's price $100. or old and reputable vendors like yasuo, moka, wefinance, sniperfox etc. selling good private guides. This is so because, this kind of guides must be have a sale quota for avoiding saturated quickly. even so this guides are burn, still useful for give ideas to members-newbies. in each cases, guides are needed for fraud adventures. these are only my ideas. i do not want to interfere with anyone's work. Regards, sorry for english.

But nothing beats actually going out and doing it yourself and learning from experience. And only other proper way I can think of learning to card besides that is to have a private tutor. But those are extremely hard to come buy since people don't want to waste their times on newbies who aren't going to get it right 99% of the time. But if you're one of those people dedicated to teaching and stuff, then good for you. Newbies just must not expect to instantly become rich without doing some proper effort in learning. Cause that's the biggest problem out there. Any idiot can card. But if he puts lots of his time and effort into learning more than just carding, the possibilities are huge.",""
"Evolution Forums","yummy5656","2509","2014-05-08T18:26:21","Re: [UPDATED 03/02] YUMMY'S HUGE Guide Pack + SUPPORT","Guides Vendors","templenetcover35 thank you very much friend. glad to business you again. Cypher i agree with you at many points. Trying it to own self and make some experiences are always the best way for learning. And yes, people may lazy for doing anything even so reading anything sometimes. There's no ""click and profit"" button on this world. i mean what you say i think. And for last, yes, everyone could card somewhere if he/she put his/her time into this job. Carding is not a hobby. People must put their effort /money as investing/ and time for success-learn. in addition i don't like people like ""hey guys i've 0.00000000000000000000001 btc and need quick $5k what must i do?"" Anyway...i try to mean, a newbie still need to read something for improving their minding about whole this things. That's why starting packs or private tuts are still necessary for starters. Without this belief, can we say ""everything is easy"" ? For example Amazon refunds are easy and there's no needness to read or buy anything any service? Just tell them , - Hello i received a package from you but nothing inside blah blah...- Hey i throw that package with an angry mood and can't take a picture or for old items - Hey i've gone to Afghanistan for my military obligation / go for a holiday / and when i arrive my home i've seen that the package in my pobox and it's empty-broken ant other shit etc.. or ink method, or sperm method...Taking photos on items, finding empty delivery boxes from mailing companies..Handwriting methods on to empty papers with photoshop, additional se skills with amazon support, creating pics without metadata with PS, amazon receipt generators etc etc. if a person like to read, of course he can do his own refund and improve his refunding strategies in just 3 months. but we can't claim this is easy for all people. That's why people still pay for refunding services or buying some documents for a STARTING POINT. some people read everthing, tries evertime and make their own service with experiences, and in the other hand some people use refunding services or paypals for 100 times.i don't know how we must called this, laziness or what. i dont know. i can not interfere with anyone's preference. i just angry with VERY VERY lazy people.  for example i or other vendor selling a guide about ""free amazon GC"".. some lazy guy bought it and do not bother change any fucking word into that tut. that guide could give them great ideas or he can easily find a new ideas but he's lazy. even so, he use same of the example gift code numbers when he chatting on amazon voucher site. and than he say on here ""hey man it's not working blah blah"" i hate this laziness. so i agree you with this. everyone have to read more. meanwhile everyone still needs beginning points for having any ideas about stuff. my only difference is if evolution open for years, my guide pack still growing for years with same price. i'll plan to add lots of more tuts for creating a great begining pack for newbies. that's my price ans sale policy. and i try to answer my customers questions as well as i do. that's only it. Thank you for your thoughts again, which cause this good conversation for me. Cheers.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against guides. Just dumbass vendors who rip newbies off by asking like $200 for a guide and guaranteeing that they will easily make $5000 a week, but the newbie doesn't have enough experience to do this so he loses quite a lot of money. So if you're someone who's into teaching new people about carding and not just after their money, then that's great! Good for you!!

Small purchases are always better for avoiding flags for fraud activities. There is no exactly limit for that method if you mean the method called ""CC TO BTC METHOD:. ***HOT-FRESH*** Need some preparing and working"" in my 6.3 update? But it's hard to execute for beginners as i said. It need some preparing process like finding , - BURNER PHONES- FAKE SCANS (ID, CC or Bills) And SE for possible verification steps. I don't want to sell any info to buyers different than i advertised. So, please FOCUS this if you want to buy my guides pack.  If you want to more private guide for ""CC to BTC"" and ""Step by step support for all process"" you can search for Evo. i've one private guide for this.As i know, ""Altair"" have one guide nowadays and he's old and vouched member for selling this kind of guides. You can search and decide on Evo market.  Just be careful about new vendors or non-vouched things for avoiding possible scams. Always use escrow. ------------ If you want to buy my guide pack, you can take whole huge pack and future updates and support for your beginner questions.

You're welcome again. @Oneclamp, you can PM ME from EVO MARKET whatever you want. I usually trying to reply all my answers within 24th hours. I noticed that you're already one of my customers who choose +support and subscription option. @gaychat, absolutely some of websites which i added before 4-5 months are burned or improve their security measures but sometimes are still fresh and accept almost like all kind of CC's includes some cheap non-vbv cards or non-avs etc. This is regular situation in this world except some of biggest sources like walmart, tigerdirect etc. Main point is CC's and drops for physical items as you guess.  ""bill=ship"" term is only a  ""trickery"" for some people who claim this. A clever website always has a chance for calling for verification or aks for some really hard photoshop proofs like ""webcam proof with your cc"" That's why i'm trying to find new cardable sites per 3 months period before they saturated.----------------------- Today's questionns replied and you can ask me via PM for new amazon guide and other questions.

I thought about your idea a few more times in past. But it's really very very hard for me and most of my customers. As you know there are tons of guides in it and also some big files, some bir *rar packages etc. My connection is so slow because of my security measures/layers and uploading whole pack to a single rar is so far for me at this moment. Also most of customers having troubles to download even a file for example 60MB. I think it'll be hard for all to download a single huge file.

Especially i really like some way in it.GET ANYTHING EBAY FOR FREE Old shit. I just put this for very noobs for improve their mind about Ebay. ****************************************** RULES / POLICY CHANGES / ADDITIONS ABOUT MY THIS SERVICE. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND DO NOT ASK ME ABOUT THIS!  First of all, high probably you'll purchase / or purchased biggest & cheapest pack in deep web with this price. From the first day when i've added this package on Evo Market to now, i always try to make changes/news about this package and also i've added lifetime support and subscription chance to my all customers. I know that kind of package and service may sell more than $200 on darknet but despite this i'll still keep my price for only $25 for a while. You'll exactly take, * A huge guide pack (more than 500+ guides/sub-tutorials and methods) with collectible and private guides (written by me) and some fresh (non-saturated valuable) guides still this price. * Lifetime Subscription (Once you purchase you can take all future updates) * Support for your beginner (or other) questions about almost everything. * Quick and good customer service. * Some good freebies in future when i'm suitable for this.  Thank you for your all interesting but since my sales growing and i've more and more customers which are purchased my service, i have to clear something and have to make a few policy changes about my sales after now. So, All my old and new customers STILL could take all future updates for FREE. But after this, i'll not sent updates to inactive customers. It means, ""all orders auto-deleted after 1 months"" via Evolution Market's policy and if a new customer buy and run my service and after 3-4 months later if he/she request me about news, i simply will not sent anything. It's a time waste for my limited time. Sorry but I can't make an effort for this kind of requests no more.My support is still going on and will be. Ask your questions only from EVO MARKET with PM. I'll not reply questions via Evolution Forums  or will not reply ""jabber conversations"" etc requests. You don't have to use PGP if you will not write very spesific information about you/country etc. But if you want to use PGP, it's not problem for me. And i suggest do not write to me or any other one any private info which is related to your real life on deep web. Don't forget first rule. Don't trust anyone on here.I usually try to answer that day's all questions within 24 hours. Please be patient. If i missed you, you can remind me again from Evo market PM or with writing this forum thread. I can't waste my time anymore with kids, some rude or impatient or LAZY people, some stupid/weird questions and requests. That kind of questions/people will not reply and if you still try to do same you'll banned from my all sales or will reported to staff. For example, >>> Imagine that, someone, purchased from me this service and it includes more than 550 guides in it about almost everything. If a regular person try to read all, it may takes 1 weeks to finish. More 2 weeks to understanding. But after 10 seconds he/she PM me with a question ""hey i'm lazy to read all man. Tell me what guide is best for quick money"" What a great customer. If you lazy even for reading, just go to any other market or vendor and take a guide with $4.33 about ""How to hack twitter 100% working!"" Don't steal my time.Another example,>>> I think there're more than 10 guides about socks5 as an example. And my buyer asked me ""Hey, where can i buy socks5 and what is socks5 pleaseeeeeeeeeeee?""Another potential buyer act,>>> ""Hey bro i asked you a question 20 minutes ago and i see that you're online at forums. Where are you reply my question ASAP!!!!!!""(After 10 minutes)>>> ""If you don't reply my question i'll do this, that blah blah."" TL:DR, i'll not give support or reply any question this kind of kids/weird questions after than.-----------------------------------------------------Remind that, i'm giving this service for this price and you're not my only customer. There're more than 50 active customers which are asking/requesting me something per/day. That kind of questions/people steal my lots of time, i can't focus my really honest and loyal customers because of this and i can't allow this no more. Please keep my words in your minds.----------------------------------------------------- My loyal customers, could be able to take more powerful support and some new private tips/tricks/guides. I like people which are active in this community and really want to learn and give something to others. So i'm glad to say you're already welcome again.Delivery is as fast as possible as always. Most likely instant. Not more than 8-10 hours. (sleeping or working breaks) ------------------------------------------------------- Coming Soon [+] I'll add two more self written guide about Paypal (one of them is about avoiding PP's phone verification shit and other auto-security measures.)[+] Lots of blackhat making money guide will add on next update.  I just need some time to prepare this until next update.-------------------------------------------------------- Thank you again for making this guide pack BESTSELLING on Evolution Market's Guide section. Never pay more MONEY for single tutorials! This amazing and booming list will continue to grow. Thank you all for your lovely feedbacks and trust. You will got the MOST UPDATED AND POWERFUL guide pack with my amazing price!  I wish good week for all members.RegardsYummy.

Paypal Blackjack will contain 21 famous questions about Paypal which are asked frequently by every single member in here. (Newbie or intermediate or even experienced level members.) This questions will be for example > - How can i perform my own semi-clean transfers?- What's the best security setup for Paypal? (What can i do)- How can i bypass Paypal's famous errors?- What's the sources for adding VCC/VBA on to my middleman accounts?- How to create a good fresh Paypal. What's my invest for this etc..- How can i create my own strong MM Paypal accounts? Whats the conditions? etc etc. I'll reply the 21 most asked question in my this guide with lots of details. I hope my customers will enjoy it as always. I just need a few more days to finish my trials and give all the best. Because i don't want any expired url or any review missed point in my new guide.  Also, as you guess i'll give my old other cashout methods with this package.

You can still buy this package for $100 within this period. My  old customers (within last 1 month) not to have pay more. I'll give updates to them for free. * Quota is 5 for the first scale.

Dont get me wrong, some of  it requires some work and some of the other metodes is quick if you got the stuff. But after first time i think its auto pilot job.  How much can you earn and how long time does it take?I have only read it, not tested it yet. Will do it soon and return to answer this question.But it seems like some of the metodes is pretty quick if you do it in the right time. (When they are open)But your are advice to keep it ""low"" but you can still eat good.  What do you need beside the guide?If you got verified pp accounts this is perfect for you. End of story.And security ofc My opinion?I like yummy and he has been very helpful to me so once again i vote up for this stuff and glad that guys like him is here for us newbies.

I paid for this guide just like any other ordinary user.This guide beats anything in its price class. Yummy describes a multitude of different and original ways to cash out. I have not tried out all of them ( so many things to do, so little time). But following this guide you will get your money x times back.You need: PP accounts, middleman pp accounts, VPN and at least socks, better use RDP. And a basic understanding of the underlying principles and OPSEC.What could be improved on: the guide is a bit unstructured. Yummy writes a lot of interesting details and tips. In a slightly chaotic way. BUT: if you are not able to connect the dots you should seriously think twice if you really want to mess with Paypal.my personal verdict: 8 out of 10 points."

As the author said, you don't need much to start doing this. However, you must put some effort into it, like every other thing you should do in this fraud world if you want to be successful, lol. I don't see any reason why this wouldn't work. This will require you some creativity, but ADIDAYZ already gives you ready-to-go models in which you can change a little and use it. In my opinion, anyone can do this, but it's always good to have an idea on how to paypal works (what you can find in many topics here on evo). Overall, these (in my opinion) are the pros and cons: + Low investment needed: some mm paypal accounts and the fullz he's saying comes with the guide,+ Simple to set-up: if you have all the resources you can finish the set-up and start in one day,+ After all the effort you must put into this at the start, later on things will be pretty easy. - You need a bit of knowledge on how to cashout a paypal account (but you can easily find this info for free on evo)- If you're a dumbass and don't know how to act like an average person on the internet, this is not for you, lol.",""

This vendor account used to be MINE about 2 months ago but I never sold anything on it and I was low on funds so I figured I might trade it for a service for something enticing under interest check. This guy here ADIDAYZ posted something about an E-commerce website so I asked him if he needed a vendor account I would give him mine in exchange for a site...so weeks go by and this dude spins me and spins or just ignores me completely and says he doesn't want to do business with me. So I am like WTF I helped this kid get started that's a pretty shitty thing do do so I post on his thread about it as a warning to not deal with this guy because if he does that shit to someone who helped him out then how is he going to treat his customers. FYI I am not a bug I would go for days without messaging this dude as I know people get busy but anyway back on track. He reads the posts and messages me saying he didn't know it was me and he is sorry please remove it. So I give this fuck head the benefit of the doubt and delete the post. He does the same shit again saying he is going to add me on Jabber but never does just keeps saying later later I will. Now I see people starting to say he scammed them. I am really sorry for giving this punk ass kid my old vendor account an I suggest nobody do business with this joker. Lucky he is too stupid to do real damage!

At first I hired a few people to do the refunds and then went back and read the customer service chat logs. I refused to believe that it was that simple. So over the last year I purchased at least 3 guides, still looking for that ""secret sauce"". There is no magic, but there are some things you must know.This guide is well put together and covers most information you need to get this sort of thing done.

He's even offering his support if you mess up the first time. Worth buying for anyone thinking about it, every single time. If you were to add anything to the guide TF, atleast for me, it would be more on drops, some quality info is already included. At the very least your recommendation of where/who to seek further information regarding them.

There are no fillers, nonsense or outdated methods that no longer work and just being sold as the author makes his exit and attempts to squeeze the last few dimes out of it. I contemplated whether or not I should sell it, yes there are already free versions of refunding guides available on the dark web but how many actually go in depth? offer various methods to execute a refund or dip? how many show you how to keep on refunding after you have exhausted all your methods? How many teach you about security? about amazon staff? The answer is ZERO and that I GUARANTEE.

Most of these methods don't work if you sign your package. There is no example conversations about doubledipping! Actually there is no ANY info about doubledipping. What method you should use first and what method after or any other explanation. I'm pointing specificly to amazon guide. Also there is no part how to refund items like TV or fucking fridges or whateder - huge items.Worst thing is that i brought this guide just because of these things that are missing. and they are: Double-dippingExample conversation of doubledippingMethod for replacement and method for refund in terms of doubledipLimits on doubledipHow to refund/double-dip Large items . TV's, etc.There is no explanation why doubledip requires sold by amazon and refund just fullfilled by amazon.  You are good refunder , no doubt , but about guide.... there is no use from guide if there is no info about doubledipping.This is good guide , but its good for JUST refunding taking out thing that couple promises are missing (Large item refunding) Meh...

Double dipping is covered quite clearly All the points you have made are because you are not using common sense or logic. The example conversation of refunding that is included is the basis of the double dip, you just use one of the MANY methods included and swap them. Use 1 for replacement and use 1 for the refund, they can be different or the same What do you mean 'There is no explanation why double dip requires sold by amazon and refund just fulfilled by amazon' - do you really need me to explain this or are you just taking the piss? It's just AMAZON policy, I can't understand why you feel I should have explained this in the guide. Large items will be included in V2 I am actually quite pissed that you would write this crap Kesh, especially considering the favor I did you last week. At least make some valid points.  Meh...",""

Double dip is just refund x2 (but first time asking for replacement) - YOU ARE MAKING IT COMPLICATED. Ignore emails about returning original items, it's part of the process - amazon will tell you the same. Are you that stupid, you need this in a guide? Investigations are part of the process, even I can't avoid them when doing. There are some techniques that I might include in v2 but really it's just part of the process.","turboklizma wrote:Like i said , you are good person. Very good.

AMAZON,ASOS,ZAPPOS & MORE Handbook V1","Guides Vendors","So I bought ThinkingForward Guide and also used his double dip service. Slight delay on my part due to a slight confusion but never the less I have got my first email in the double dip process.  His guide is laid out very well and for me is easy to follow along. I under stand people are bit confused about him not explaining how to do each part but you actually just need to follow his steps. He clearly explains different scenarios in which they can be used for. Looking to give it a bash myself on a small order soon.  With the update of V2 also coming also look forward to learning more. All in all I would say its a good guide if you apply yourself. Like he says above double dip is just the replacement method then the refund method. SIMPLES Cheers",""

"Evolution Forums","Draconem","20314","2014-09-13T21:21:54","Re: [AWESOME] CARDING UNIVERSITY VIRTUAL EDITION [CUVE] +FraudFox","Guides Vendors","So here is my personal review... This is the only investment I wish I ever made on the deepweb. The return from this investment will easily make up for the initial price to become one of his students.  Before I actually signed up for the classes I was very skeptical as to how much information he could give me to become successful and I also thought that maybe I should just spend the cost on my own trial and error experiments.....Let me tell you, DONT! To gain this kind of knowledge  will cost you more than what these classes are going for.  With that said here are a few things i loved about the classes -He answers every question you have. Even stays after class to chat and throw in some extra knowledge that wasnt on the agenda for the day.-classes are fast paced. Dont get me wrong, he does not rush through the materia, it is lnoob friendly but this is a carding UNIVERSITY not carding ELEMENTARY-very knowledgeable teacher, has tons and tons of personal experience you can learn from- Many different types of carding topics that are covered. honestly the information is virtually endless and will leave you on your path to becoming a successful carder. For complete noobs, there will definitely be a learning curve, but dont let that scare you. The price of this class could easily go for 600-700 usd. If youre a noob and new to the deepweb I understand ur skepticism but i wish something like this was available to me back in late 2013 when I joined tcf.  Bannedebooks is indeed a professional, breeding nothing but professionals through this University. And sorry if it sounds like Im over selling it, Im not that great at writing reviews but I was just really satisfied with this investment. 10/10.

What can I say that hasn't been said already. This course is the real deal. Bannedebooks really knows his stuff. If you are really serious about becoming a high level carder, than this course is for you. Even if you spend your money on 10 or more guides I doubt you will be up to the pace of someone that took this class. Believe me, I read every single thing that I can get my hands on and still never even came across any of the secrets he taught me. Don't be worried about the cost as this is money well spent.

After the 4 classes he'll even give the attention that you need for an eventual doubt, that's awesome! I can only say that now I have the basic and the advanced knowledge to start a real carding experience! This week I'll start to put it on practice! No more theories!   You'll have not only the knowledge, but a dedicated person who will give you the necessary attention that you're looking for my fellow noob, and more, this guy is so great that you'll probably get not a teacher but a friend!!!

"Evolution Forums","spectator5","20314","2014-10-03T09:57:40","Re: [AWESOME] CARDING UNIVERSITY VIRTUAL EDITION [CUVE] +FraudFox","Guides Vendors","I've just had my final lesson in the carding university and I can tell you it was the best investment Ive made so far in my deepweb career.  What bannedebooks can offer is more than just lessons, but rather years of trial and error. I'm going to tell you right now, to all the newbies here, thats all this carding game is about. Trial and Error. You're gonna lose alot of money, especially if you keep on being these bullshit guides advertised on the forums. Thats how the game is, youre going to lose lots before you win some.  No guide offers the wisdom given by bannedebooks. What convinced me to join the carding university was the IM chat we had before I even purchased the lessons. Banned was very keen to detail and there was no glorification of his lessons. He told me what he offered, why it was superior, and cleared any doubt I had.  I'm a very meticulous person, organization is very important and it should be to anyone here thats trying to make some real money here. The lessons offer ideal ways to keep all your data (fulls, cc, cardable sites, autoshops, etc) tightly knit together and easily accessible. I personally loved his carding setup, efficiency at its finest.  The resourcefulness of bannedebooks is definitely impressive, he really teaches you how to get the best bang for your buck. I mean god damn, I really wish I could start my career all over again cause I seriously wasted many of my resources. The best way I can describe these lessons, for me, is making the transition from a part-time fraudster to a career fraudster. Banned provided the contacts that only very few carders have a hold of, teaches basically the ins and outs of most fraud ventures offered on the market (pp transfers, bank drops, carding setup, REAL FUCKIN SOCKS, ecommerce fraud), and helps you get into the mindset of how to card successful in whatever field you want to try.  The last thing I want to say is that after youre done with the lessons, youre not going to have to scour these forums (either here or tcf) for methods because you'll have all you need to create youre own. If youre tired of waiting for the veteran carders throwing you a guide on a method that they already probably burnt, its time to enroll.

First of all I would like to thank BannedeBooks for this 4 day tutoring. He has turned me into something I never thought would have been possible, a carder who can actually card the items he needs. Here is what I have learned from this- Organization-More links to sites than I know what to do with-real checkers that dont kill cards-how to find balances-merchant carding-paypal transfers for real not just some silly guide, real explanations- creating real bank drops-all kinds of guides from first hand experience-he goes though the tutoring as if you were his student-teaches you the dos and donts-how do card online among other ways-find eshops to killand much much much more He guided me from day 1 to day 4 explaining every little details and every question I had he answered quickly and it makes sense. Its not just some class where you dont learn learn anything like all the guides here on evo ( most )He talked me though everything form start to finish going though every day focusing on a couple different parts. By the end of the entire class. i have mastered the site that gave me troubles the the first try. I successfully put an order for 12k worth of Apple products.  Im not saying this is typical but he provides everything you will need to become a successful carder. So for all you  NOOBS and Intermediate carders!....STOP dont waste any more money on burning cards for small items, no more guessing available credit, no more wasting time and money. TAKE THIS CLASS! you wont regret it! Most of you wont take this class because of the price and what I say to that is..RAISE THE PRICE!! This is worth a damm hell of a lot. I will update my review with photos of my 12k successful card ones items arrive. If you ahev any questions PM me and ill answer them but I suggest taking this. You will take years off of failing. Thank you BannedeBooks for this. Amazing guy, great vendor. 1,000 out of 10 GravyCat",""

"Evolution Forums","bannedebooks","20314","2014-08-23T10:01:10","Re: [AWESOME] CARDING UNIVERSITY VIRTUAL EDITION [CUVE] +FraudFox","Guides Vendors","Hello, first at all many thanks to GravyCat. I was very fortunate to have him as my very first student. I loved to find that he was an intermediate level user that has spent many countless hours learning everything that the forums has to offer, and still, I was able to give him so much valuable new information that he never got somewhere else and that will never be publicly available. I think I was able to close a circle of what used to be a lot of scattered ideas and made his knowledge something more solid, preparing a nourishing land for seeds that will grow trees full of money. I know you will hear a lot of this guy in the future. The best part of being a teacher is to learn from his students, and at the end GravyCat amazed me with a huge and profitable method that he developed for himself. He also told me that he is cooking some ideas that might be later sold as guides on evo and I'm sure we won't be dissapointed. This guy only goes and think in big. Not only I made a client of my course, but I think I gained a great friend in business. Thank you GraviCat.

I loved to find that he was an intermediate level user that has spent many countless hours learning everything that the forums has to offer, and still, I was able to give him so much valuable new information that he never got somewhere else and that will never be publicly available. I think I was able to close a circle of what used to be a lot of scattered ideas and made his knowledge something more solid, preparing a nourishing land for seeds that will grow trees full of money. I know you will hear a lot of this guy in the future. The best part of being a teacher is to learn from his students, and at the end GravyCat amazed me with a huge and profitable method that he developed for himself. He also told me that he is cooking some ideas that might be later sold as guides on evo and I'm sure we won't be dissapointed. This guy only goes and think in big. Not only I made a client of my course, but I think I gained a great friend in business. Thank you GraviCat."

"Evolution Forums","BareMonk","20314","2014-09-03T01:45:53","Re: [AWESOME] CARDING UNIVERSITY VIRTUAL EDITION [CUVE] +FraudFox","Guides Vendors","Here it is... First off, I would like to thank bannedebooks for this experience. I went from being all over the place to being extremely organized. His methods are truly amazing and unique.  If you are into carding to get physical items, ENROLL RIGHT NOW. Bannedebooks' method to card physical item is so rare that maybe 5% of the carding population uses it, if that. You will also be provided with the tools and knowledge to properly check your cards without fucking up and also finding out the balance on your cards. The university also provides knowledge for autocarding. *You will learn how to do PayPal transfers* Within this university, you'll learn something that most people on Evo are trying to learn; you'll learn how to make bank dropz. Knowing that I would learn how to make bank dropz was one of the main reason why I enrolled and thank god I enrolled.  On to the juicy stuff. From day 1 to day 4, bannedebooks spent his time explaining everything to the teeth and not only did he answere every single one of my questions but made sure I knew why the answer was what it was. Bannedebooks is completely organized with his teaching because he sectors everything into separate days, at first I didn't like that, but after day 3, I understood why he did what he did. He essentially builds you from bottom up and by the end of day 4 you'll have enough knowledge to make back the money within a week at most.  Best part of enrolling in this university is that bannedebooks will help you and answer any questions you have even after classes. If you are fairly new to carding, dig up the money and enroll now! This will save you tons of money.  If you read up this line, stop reading and enroll already, seats are limited and price increases after each student enrolls.  QUIT SLEEPING ON THIS.

I started out at ultra nooby and he was very patient explaining every step and going over concepts that at first, were difficult to understand. He is an excellent teacher, who offers a large amount of resources for students to read in their own time and answers any questions you might have. The 'university' part of this course, is that some of the things he teaches you wont think are useful or you will not be able to understand them right away. However we enough studying and practicing, everything he says is put into action. He also gives students tips about maintaining motivation and productivity. I have learnt a ton about carding and this is much better than waiting around to see if a new guide or method is being released on the general market place. This is a mindset and educational course, in addition to teaching proven methods. Money well spent",""

Thank you for participating Tiger... Guys, price will rise again for $100. New classes starts this monday. PM me if you're interested. Cheers.","TIGER30 wrote:I completed Bannedebooks Carding University and I have to say that I received a top notch education and a thorough breakdown of the process of carding in multiple ways.As a complete noob, Bannedebooks was hesitant to even accept me as a student bc ""you have to go to high school before you enter the University"". After proving my committment (bothering him relentlessly), Bannedebooks decided to let me take the course. What I can say is this...as a noob it can be very difficult to connect the dots and clarify the valuable information from the BS guides and shitty vendors. Bannedbooks course is golden because he starts from the proper mindset and approach to carding and lays out how to structure your carding endeavors for success all the way to completion. At times I was mad at myself bc I wish I had more questions to ask. He was willing to answer any questions or address any doubts I had about his lessons. He was also very flexible as far a our schedule for the course which I deeply appreciated. He shares resources, his prior experience, and even gave me some cvvs to get started! As a student I could not ask for more. He basically gives you the information AND the means to get MORE than a return on your investment. It's kind of like the carding stimilus package lol. This university should be your first and last stop for information on successful carding. The rest is up to your creativity, determination, and application of what he tells you.The better part is that Bannedebooks remains available as a resource to help you as you apply his teachings. I really can't really put a price on the information he has shared with me..but I know he is giving you 10x the value of your average guide for a fraction of the cost. This investment is worth it!"

No have, sorry. I invest all of my free time giving support to my graduated students, researching new methods and making of this course the best thing any carder would ever dream. They can testify. Anyway, if you're asking about basic lessons, all the basics can be already found all over the forums and internet. When you want the hidden and fresh content, you can then come and contact me. However, I have some drafts on some nice articles I might release. Mainly about opsec. I'm also building a nice resource tool for carders which will have free and premium content. Something never seen before, and I'm sure will be loved by any serious carder. Im about 80% complete with this project, and of course, all of my new students will benefit of it. In other news, is confirmed: CUVE is going to be out for public next week. Current students are already benefiting part of it.  I also partnershipped with HugoChavez, creator of the FraudFox Spoofer Machine, to give a voucher of 1 full free month of his software service, valued at $100. I also created a full guide for it that I'll be sharing with my new students. 1 month old students will still need to pay for the update. Newer students will receive this update for free, along the FraudFox voucher.","coderiver555 wrote:Do you have any free lessons available?"

And fuck, why there's nothing more ? I want more ! Everything bannedebook will teach you has his importance, everything he will teach you is linked to each other, nothing is useless. Everything is great, you understand what separate a pro-carder from the newbies. He will covers from how to organize everything you need to success to how to create bank drop, passing through how looking legit from the eyes of companies like PP, and autocarding. About me, before the course I would consider me as a mid-carder, I bought few other guides, I had knowledge but that one was wobbly, I still had some questions. But banned answered them all. He also strengthened some knowledge I thought complete. I also was teaching wrong stuff. Due to the jet-lag, it was first difficult to attend to the classes, I did some sacrifice like reducing my sleeping time (and no one know how hard it is for me ), but damn, that was worth it. Someone said quit sleeping on this, I would say quit your everyday life for this, at least during four little days, you won't be disappointed.  Today after the 4 Days classes, I feel like a pro carder, and I'm ready to rock them all. I also -I hope so huh..  - made a business friend. If you want to make the cash flown, this course is what you need. Put your house on this, it will be a return on investment.",""

I havenât quite reached the golden streets of Eldorado yetâ¦ but when I get there I suspect Iâll have much more to say. That said the information you receive in this course is invaluable in terms of learning curve. I canât imagine how long itâd take me to figure out all this stuff on my own. Its like having the information uploaded to your brain. As long as your willing to learn. Banned will teach and with PATIENCEâ¦ Which for me personally has made this course invaluable. In fact Iâm still learning because banned is such a nice guy. This is the selling point. He sticks around. For me this had made the course worth it becauseâ¦ its essentially gaining banned as a friend that will make sure you make moneyâ¦. so many of the experience guys are cocky, of no use/help to noobs, and canât be botheredâ¦ but banned is guiding me to light and letting me pick his brain and assist me as I see fit. This is where the VALUE is in the beginning just in case anybodyâs wondering. I almost donât want anyone else to sign up because if banned is as nice to everyone else as he is to me. Then honestly evo and the noobs are lucky to have him but Iâd like to think Iâm getting special treatment. Anyway raise the PRICE! Lol. - Winnnn

What I can tell you from my personal experience is this: Life teaches you a LITTLE bit about a lot of little things, but a University... like this University, teaches you everything you need to start becoming an expert in something NO ONE else around you can do. All truly successful people go to some type of higher education to get what you need & become who you want to be.If you're reading this, please think twice before you sign up, cuz this course is SO GOOD, that I just don't want the competition.;raphlavoie wrote:I paid for 4 courses and I have not had 4 course ...

I've been relatively busy with other things so I have not been able to put much of the valuable theory I've learned into practice yet. As many other students have confessed, at a price of ~$600, you will learn things that are nearly priceless. Will you suddenly transition from a noob carder into a pro overnight? No, this isn't magic. With that said, Banned provides lessons and resources that will SERIOUSLY help you progress and become much better at what you currently do and what you didn't do before. It is crucial to be organized and precise in every aspect of your projects and Banned will teach you how to adapt this mindset. He is knowledgeable, friendly, thorough, and always willing to assist. Please note that not all of the topics are easy to grasp immediately. Much like a real university course, you need to continuously study, re-read, ask questions and put what you learn into PRACTICE. There may be pieces that you may not fully understand right away, but this is natural. If you have any questions during the lesson you can approach Banned with them and he will tackle them immediately (but please, remember as a student, focus and listen to Banned carefully before drowning him with questions that could be avoided by focusing). There were times where he would go out of his way to do research to provide me with the best possible answer to my question and I can't thank him enough for that. Banned provides you with more than one route to tackle a project. This is priceless as we all know how important it is to be flexible as a carder.  Besides the different routes, Banned provides methods and tactics that you may have never considered otherwise. He really opened up my eyes to different opportunities and the steps to help me succeed.Banned is flexible with his timing and I had very little trouble scheduling lesson times that worked for me, him and other students. There are no lessons on the weekend, but for someone who works so hard during the week it's completely understandable.Besides his lessons, he is a constant source of support after completion of the course. As others have mentioned, you are not only buying four lessons with Banned, you are also investing in an EXTREMELY knowledgeable contact and friend (if he wants to be your friend that is, lol).Best of luck folks."

I think this can interest anybody. I achieve my grounding a little bit more than a month ago. I really started applying what I learned at the beginning of the month. It was the very first time I attempted a card.  Today I received my first transfer from Stripe thank to what I learned from Michael.  Setting up everything properly took me a lot of time and money, $250 for VPN, Socks, CC, Host, IDs etc... (All you need to success is explained in his course anyway) But today, I reimbursed all my setup AND the University. That is to say more than 800$. And that's only the beginning, my account is still alive and in good shape. With only one attempt. I don't think it's luck. I rather said I was correctly trained. Don't be afraid to put the money on this course, I swear to God it's an investment. Today I can start thinking buying something really great for my girlfriend for Christmas. Not some shitty earring which cost 70$ max.  Thanks for all Michael. You learned me so much, I will never be enough grateful to you. You're the real MVP.",""

I would really like to just bypass this process of telling you guys of how GREAT THIS CLASS is & also how AWESOME IS THE TEACHER !!!!!Why ??? Because I really would prefer to keep this info TOP SECRET!!! To start I am a SUPER SUPER SUPER  NOOB ( special ed. ) LOL!!! Had no clue of how this particular game was even played . That all changed in a matter of days ! The wealth of knowledge is so extensively detailed and taught with such patience that I believe ALMOST anyone come become a pro ..... if they can just follow directions , do a little independent research and execute the instructions. Information can be more powerful than gold , that is exactly why I did not hesitate to cough up the coins to get access to the proper protocol for efficiency! I've seen associates dabble in this carding games for years with inconsistency ....because they did not  have the proper recipe (KNOWLEDGE)! Well this has the possibility to be a life changer if applied properly!!! This class is PRICELESS !!! Its like learning martial arts in a matter of days !The best part is knowing that you can come back to the MASTER if you need any guidance or words of WISDOM! That's right he doesn't just disappear after your sessions are done ...HE REMAINS A CLUTCH... he is a true PROFESSOR!!! This whole experience has been SURREAL !!! The professor is too kind for even sharing such INFORMATION OF VALUE ! The way assistance was provided , there is no question in my mind that he wants all his students to be thorough and  successful !Once the sessions were over I IMMEDIATELY MADE MY MONEY BACK !!! The only complications that I may have suffered were do to me be a noob lol ! HA , but it didn't matter because I was taught by the best!!! I AM A PRO NOW !!!!! I can go on & on & ON & ON of how great this class was ..... but if you don't get it ... you just don't get it !                                              THANKS BANNED , YOUR THE FUGGIN MAN !

This is my personal review of the Carding University.  I took the course just before Christmas. Before I took the guide I was a super noob at carding, I barely knew any carding terms, I didn't understand how to card at all. I thought it was a walk in the park and that anybody could do it. However, Banned showed me that there is a lot involved in carding. Believe me when I say this guy gives you more than enough knowledge to do it. He covers every aspect in it. However,  don't be fooled, that does not mean that that after you complete the course that you'll be a pro. You have to be realistic about this, everyone has to spend time learning and training to become good at any skill. You have to work hard at it. I am still learning more and more everyday I read over what he's taught me and being patient and organised are very important if you want to be successful. I had so many questions to ask this guy and I didn't hesitate. It doesn't matter how stupid the question might sound, he will answer everything. Banned makes sure that you are comfortable with what is going on before he moves onto the next topic. Even after we finished the course I didn't fully understand everything and I contacted him days ater the course and he was there to answer all my questions, and I have the confidence in him to be there for me if I have a question for him tomorrow. I think this shows what kind of person he is. It is difficult to trust people on this, but I  vouch for this guy. I haven't put into practice what I've learned yet, but I want to be completely organised before I start. You gotta invest money to make money. An investment of about $600 is nothing if you put it into perspective of how much money you could make from this. Thousands.. it's completely up to you how ambitious you are. At the end of the day it's the customers decision, but Banned is a good guy who'll put 110% into working with you. Thanks again Banned for all the help! I'll be sure to buy my cards from you when you're back in stock!   chocolatedroppa",""

Its very professional the tutor explains to you even the smallest details while keeping it coherent and not jump between subjects. That eases the process of understanding everything. After every session you have a question time where he answers whatever question that could have about the subject. If its gonna be explained in the second session he will tell you that he is going to take up that subject in another session and he does it. He doesn't just teach the methods. He teaches a mindset that helps you to become very successful in this line of work. It have helped me tremendously these few days that I've been using his methods and way work.  The amount of information he teaches you are insane. Ive took courses from other sources here and his material covers all of that plus a little extra. Keep in mind im not a beginner in this line of work. I knew most of the methods but he teaches you those special things that needs to be in check to make it work. Everyone here knows probably what they should do but not how. Its those small details that define if youre gonna be successful with something or not. And this course explains all of those.  The amount of material is actually tremendous. From the start you will get a bunch of very informational and helpful notes and new ebooks where the stuff he teaches you are explained in even more detail. Im not the guy that usually writes reviews because i usually feel cheated when i buy stuff here from evo. Many here will just give you two lines of information and call that a guide. But here everything is explained to full extent. Its truly a from NOOB to PRO CARDING UNIVERSITY DEGREE i guarantee you lol I dont think I have to tell you its worth the money. 2 weeks and you will triple it if you worked like 4 hours in total those 2 weeks. After the information you get here its only your ambition that stops you.  This review is from a guy that isnt a noob in this area. Ive cashed out alot before getting this guide but i was interested to see how others worked and it opened up my eyes. Truly revelating",""

I was able to make a basic setup and card things like a pair of adidas shoes or things like that , but have no idea about such thing like auto-carding exists.Then I bought Alpha02's Carder Science the lates version which gave me the picture of auto-carding and good opsec setup. but it didn't let me see the whole operation in wide perpective .then I saw that bannedebooks was offering his ""Carding University"" .I was already his customer for balanced cvvs which is also a ""100% go for it "": and  A+++ product. 1.Mike will give an ultimate tool to keep your whole operation in one place and literally turn up your performance for 1000%. just this one thing makes your carding abbilities level up as you will be able to run 10-20 operations simultaneously with a perfect organisation which is crucial here. 2.Mike will share with you his own method for carding high priced goods which is not burnt to a crisp and really you won't find it anywhere on the forums.3.you'll get a really up to date secret formulas about the whole autocarding dealings and you will get it also in the biggest possible picture when you add his own authorship guides I'm telling you only the sky is the limit!!!4.You won't need to buy your bank drops for 150$ on evo anymore as he gives you a methods to open them easily by yourself which is unspoken saving and makes your invesment return even here.5.you'll get guides and information worth at least 1500$ which makes your investement in carding university return even better6. you'll get Mikes support which is literally priceless. You'll be able to clear your every doubt with a real PRO .You won't need to desperately look for info on your every doubt for hours in the forums. Honestly I feel like I abuse his patience a little but he's very patient.7.After month from finishing CU I run 15 operations and for now just from 3 of them I have 4000$ in my bank dropsand 12 of them I didn't even started to card them .8.If you're lazy you won't have success here. I work like crazy cause I really appreciate how priceless is mike's support here .THE CONCLUSION Carding University is most def the best invested 600$ in my life .With your  honest dedication and work to your project you'll get a really good success rate  in your Carding operations and most def you will not call youself noob anymore(however not a real pro since yhat needs you to invent your own methods , but you get a tools to do that so it is only a matter of time when you become a pro). I'm telling you GO FOR IT FOR  100% !!!!!!!!BTW Mike is a really nice and straightforward person to know in Deep Web and just like that.Cheers.",""

Bannedebookâs mentorship is truely OG. So far, there hasnât been any filler - no useless chitchat that adds as a distraction. Just a steady stream of detailed information. Attached w/ the info are resources & thereâs one in particular that will serve you well throughout your carding career. Iâm not very talkative (been very focused) - so it was pleasant to see that I was being asked if I had questions throughout our sessions so far.  As of today, Iâm getting what I paid for - Itâs clear to me that thereâs experience because when I have questions thereâs no hesitation in responses. And I try to push the envelope when I have questions. For me, I believe that Iâm starting to see the bigger picture & how the puzzle pieces will be fitting together. When this happens youâll have multiple thoughts/ideas & those will distract you from other key points that can kill your career. Stay strong & resist those urges to rush! Those ideas/thoughts can be later tested once you have your security down (thats my noob advice for other noobs).  All that I can say is Thank You - and - this is a great experience.",""

It's not a prerequisite to have 2000 posts before you can buy anything, right? I'm not saying to NOT do your due diligence but it's not necessary to label things as fake all the time.

You might even improve it!! in my case what bannedbooks taught me is enough to keep me busy for a couple of years without buying any new guides! already made 1387$ in 9 days!BANNEDBOOKS is a TRUE PROFESSIONAL!!!! ohh and most importantly hes got all his courses prepared in advance and adapted to everyones special needs!STOP WASTING TIME.

"Evolution Forums","datsdatshit","20314","2014-12-06T04:06:15","Re: [AWESOME] CARDING UNIVERSITY VIRTUAL EDITION [CUVE] +FraudFox","Guides Vendors","Hey everyone, I finished Banned's course a few days ago. I've been relatively busy with other things so I have not been able to put much of the valuable theory I've learned into practice yet. As many other students have confessed, at a price of ~$600, you will learn things that are nearly priceless. Will you suddenly transition from a noob carder into a pro overnight? No, this isn't magic. With that said, Banned provides lessons and resources that will SERIOUSLY help you progress and become much better at what you currently do and what you didn't do before. It is crucial to be organized and precise in every aspect of your projects and Banned will teach you how to adapt this mindset. He is knowledgeable, friendly, thorough, and always willing to assist.  Please note that not all of the topics are easy to grasp immediately. Much like a real university course, you need to continuously study, re-read, ask questions and put what you learn into PRACTICE. There may be pieces that you may not fully understand right away, but this is natural. If you have any questions during the lesson you can approach Banned with them and he will tackle them immediately (but please, remember as a student, focus and listen to Banned carefully before drowning him with questions that could be avoided by focusing). There were times where he would go out of his way to do research to provide me with the best possible answer to my question and I can't thank him enough for that. Banned provides you with more than one route to tackle a project. This is priceless as we all know how important it is to be flexible as a carder.  Besides the different routes, Banned provides methods and tactics that you may have never considered otherwise. He really opened up my eyes to different opportunities and the steps to help me succeed. Banned is flexible with his timing and I had very little trouble scheduling lesson times that worked for me, him and other students. There are no lessons on the weekend, but for someone who works so hard during the week it's completely understandable. Besides his lessons, he is a constant source of support after completion of the course. As others have mentioned, you are not only buying four lessons with Banned, you are also investing in an EXTREMELY knowledgeable contact and friend (if he wants to be your friend that is, lol). Best of luck folks.",""

I was arrested recently (but found un-guilty due to a hell of a lawyer) and haven't been active on anything. I'm not LE, nor has LE taken over my account. Ironic that I get arrested for committing a crime, then I pay for the legal fees that got me out of it, by committing another crime... lol. No bullshit is going on here. I'm about to release the most raw and profitable method you can find on the market. Before the game I was in an industry that some of you may be familiar with, however I won't disclose. I worked behind the scenes and dealt with fraudsters and people trying to work the system. I know almost everyone and how their platforms are performing and what fraud detection they may have in place.  Guess what? I'm going to teach you how to exploit them. Ever since I left I have been trying to find a way to make money from them, as a fraudster. Nothing is better than being a fraudster and having the knowledge of those who you're trying to fraud. For the past 4 months I have been working on a way to do this. I've found this way. What I've done is built a bot to automate the process and make the money practically come in automatically. Carding is involved with this method, however the bot automatically does this all by itself.  The best part is you are making a 1700% profit on each card. To sum it up, have you heard of JungleMoney? Moka's guide? Well it is about Stripe carding and his system is automatically setup to auto-card Stripe payments. My guide/method/bot is pretty much his guide, without Stripe and Stripe's stupid security features and with me having contacts with Stripe's Staff and knowing how their platform works in-and-out.  For $950 (2/5 copies sold, price changes on every sale) you will receive the following: Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/48233 I cannot communicate via ICQ or Jabber as I had to ditch all electronics I had. Please use PM via marketplace or forum only.

This method contains everything from getting started to how to transfer the money to your bank! It has nothing to do with any payment processor you are familiar with and has been discussed on the EVO market (Square, Authorize, Stripe). For this method you will require time, basics of carding, CC's and a bank drop.You will be hitting each CC for $20-$30 The method pays you monthly on the day it's set by the company you will be carding.

It's not meant to compete with the PayPal transfer services.

This intensive guide has enough info to keep newbies sucked into all the new data and veterans thinking of new ways to modify and expand their current operations.  The sheer volume of different methods is impressive. Itâs like he shows you how to make each individual puzzle piece then a few different ways to arrange them. He explains how to build an environment, populate it, work it then cash out. Other guides sold at comparable prices by other vendors (at the same level) are nowhere near in depth as Jungle Money.

The best thing about this guide is that it will teach you so much more than just doing transfers and cashing out. You will also learn how to get a US drop, a US bank account, document scans and how to check your CVVs correctly.The only contra is that it's very US centric. If you don't have drops in the EU to receive some of the required components, you will have a much more difficult time cashing out. But whether you have the components or not, I would still advice anyone to buy this guide + The Four Horseman, because it gives you so many ideas to develop your own methods and that's what makes it so valuable to me.",""

I must say that I'm continually impressed by the stuff moka puts out. If all guides were as well thought out and structured as this man's stuff LE would have a much bigger problem on its hands than it currently does. There are multiple methods shared and explained as well as all of the necessary setup needed to be successful in milking these paypal accounts. The guide and methods are all clearly explained. You can tell he put thought and care into this shit which is rare for any of these guide vendors (including a lot of the hyped up popular ones). If your a newb you'll make money, if you're a veteran you'll make money. What else do you want from a guide?

And it included Ladron+ and his updated CVV to Paypal guide as a bonus. Now I've just finished reading Moka's new guide, JungleMoney, and I'm even more blown away. I learned so much from both guides that it's enabling me to piece together my MASTER PLAN in my mind and how I want to proceed. The God of Cash is now looking down upon me and the cloud of cash, hookers and blow is ready to rain down on me.

At first I thought it was going to be the same stuff that I already knew but since I bought Moka's other guide, the 4 horseman, I took a chance on it and glad I did.  Great for newbies but alot to learn for vets also, quite a few unique spins on the actual cash out part and with even a little creativity you can apply the system anywhere in the world. Thanks moka!

This is the answer to people interested in the Four Horsemen guide but are opposed to eCommerce administration.  Many components are the same.  It's written from a US perspective but easily applied to anywhere in the world.

The guide is straightforwards, to the point, detailed and I do not doubt functional. The methods described are somehow simple yet genius. Is the guide a completely flawless noob to pro guide? No (You still need to be smart and do your research!). Is it the best guide I have ever purchased? Absolutely. Your money is well invested here, really, this is not another bullshit 10$ CC>>BTC guide. It lays out a simple yet powerful method of cashing out CVVs, also in big style, using PayPal or Neteller (The focus is mostly on PayPal, though). If you do things right, you could probably move almost any amount of money, but it could become labor intensive. What I liked the most about Jungle Money is the large number of great sites and detailed explanations of how they work and why they're bad/good. As a small comment, I would have added a small chapter on staying secure, as I think noobs doing what this guide suggests without a VPN or similar are probably pretty vulnerable. Then again, if you don't know how to stay safe, you shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff. Moka always gives an alternative or two to basically every step of the path, which is great. To those wondering how well this would work outside of the US: If you are in the US, you get a pretty powerful method to cash out a lot quickly, but Moka being the weird carder genius he is gives us a nice method to acquire that same method overseas without very much hassle. But it's definitely not required, I won't be using that method for example. It's easy to do everything completely virtual, maybe slightly more labor intensive. Overall though the methods describe are not very labor intensive and mostly require you to do one thing for 10mins or so and then wait for a day or two. The guide also includes a few awesome extra infos such as good sites to use and a PayPal fraud trick. The only (extremely minor) complaint I have is perhaps that I had a bit of difficulties understanding some things at first due to the way the chapters were formatted, but I'm foreign so it might have just been my bad English  . And since Moka promises customer support after purchase, I have no doubt I'll have my minor questions answered easily. Do note future purchasers that (of course) just buying this guide won't magically give you all the resources needed to do what it describes. I would say to expect to pay around 200-300$ before you can fully apply the methods in this guide, but if you're lucky and the carder gods shine on you, you could make that (and the guide's cost) back in just a few days. Overall I can only highly praise this guide and it's amazing wealth of knowledge. Thank you Moka for making this wonderful guide, and expect me to be buying the Four Horsemen soon!",""

I'll try to explain it as detailed as I can without spoiling anything about the guide (Moka surely wouldn't like that!). First I'd suggest reading this: http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=13656 It's really an amazing resource. I even made an offline copy I liked it so much! Basically, my problem here is that at one point Moka talks about RDP, but the way it is done I as a paranoid cypherpunk find a bit unsafe. Here is what I'm gonna do to stay safe: 1) Buy about 100$ of BTC, and immediately run that through Bitmixer2) Get myself a year of Mullvad VPN (imo the best of the best, doesn't log anything, no payment info saved, 100% anonymous. 6$ for a month, 70$ for a year) with bitcoins3) Install a copy of win7 (get the iso on piratebay or something) on a virtualbox VM inside of a hidden truecrypt container configured to always use Mullvad (You could also just set your entire host to use the VPN, so the NSA has an even tougher job finding you hah)4) Buy an ****** (Chapter 1 b, if you know what I mean) acc here on evo (about 5$) and register it for you-know-what5) Only connect to ****** and do all Jungle Money/other carding related activities through the VM running through Mullvad Many people will be a little iffy on using Win7 as the OS (I'm iffy too), so if you have the know-how, I'd suggest using a Linux RDP client, but I have no idea how good Linux supports RDP. Just installed Kali on my USB stick myself, lovely system, and have Whonix running in a VM on it. I'll report back if I get RDP working on it (Maybe use Teamviewer? Hmm, I must experiment). Just in general, whenever doing something fishy or illegal, be behind a VPN, and better yet inside a VM inside a hidden container, which gives you full plausible deniability. I haven't tested this all in this context but I see no reason for it to not work. Stay safe, and if you have anymore questions I'll do my best to help.

Since it's moka's guide, nothing but stellar information. However, I'm going to keep my thoughts as brief as possible. Basically, if you do not make money from this, I suggest that you just quit and get a 8-5 job. It's basically free money. It's extremely flexible. Also, the more you know the system and the more you're familiar of how the system works, the money just flows in and it multiplies weekly/monthly. If you invest $1000 into this(including the guide), your cashout probability will be around AT LEAST 300% and it doesn't stop there.",""

You have to do your own configuration, RDP is just a way to get some extra benefits but after your safe configuration, I would bet moka is not recommending go from your PC to RDP directly."

Furthermore, I'm releasing an extensive FAQ today or tomorrow (I'm 90% finished). This FAQ will give you a few free tips on how to age your accounts, so you should definitely keep an eye out for it! The guide will also show you how to easily build your own transaction history (one method). Here is an outtake from the FAQ regarding your question: ""Can I get the same results from Jungle Money, but using semi-clean Paypal funds from the marketplace instead? Sure, If you're not very good at carding or simply can't be bothered with it, skip the 3 CVV to PP methods and use a PP transfer service of your choice instead. Once the money is in, use the methods provided in the guide to successfully cashout. Rinse and repeat. Having said that, Jungle Money is not meant to compete with the PayPal transfer services on Evolution. If you look at my post history, you'll see that I was complaining about not working with PayPal 6 months ago when I saw people throwing around figures like  2 or 3 thousand dollar transfers. I wanted to get in on it too but I only knew eCommerce so I took what I had and started building an environment similar to what I did with the Four Horsemen guide.So, in a way this is the alternative guide for people who don't want to work with eCommerce and web development, and have better access to e-wallet services rather than bank accounts."" I hope this helped you out!","wesley91 wrote:Hello I'm looking to buy for receiving semi-clean transfer, would this guide cover that? (like how to age paypal accounts etc.)thanks"

You guys have given us so much praise, it' incredible! And we're more than grateful for that. However, in my humble opinion, the best way to make a business even better, (which is my personal focus at the moment) is by encouraging you, the customer, to also give us some constructive criticism. Do let us know what lacks, what sucks, what you think we could do better and what you would like to see next. It would help us immensely. If you would like to contribute in this way, please contact MonkeyBusiness directly via the marketplace, where we can talk things through in detail. Alterntively, you can always through in some ideas here in the discussion thread, after all that's what it has been created for other than reviews.   What's Next 1) 99% of support requests have been answered today (and in general), I will go through 2 more PMs today and then:2) I'm finishing up the free administration handbook for you guys, that I unfortunately had to delay, due to the heavy workload and personal life shit. Since, I have now efficiently dealt with my personal crap, things will move even better and faster now.3) The continued production of my stores is scheduled for tomorrow and I already have two customers selected for that. That's all I can say for now on my web stores. It is currently just a part-time gig, but I hope I can eventually offer them to everyone. It's just difficult to deliver both, quality and quantity at the same time, while also having to run other money-making ventures. I'm sure you understand.4) By the end of November, The Money Business FAQ will be updated with more information, in particular questions regarding the AWS RDP set-up, as most people seem to have issues with that. I'll make this crystal clear to you. The Jungle Money section will be also extensively updated with more information.5) On an end note, keep the support requests coming, the average respond time is 24 - 48 hours. Don't worry about annoying me with your questions, it takes A LOT to actually break my patience and out of probably 100+ conversations it only happened once where I had to put someone into place. The most important thing, especially if you're a newbie, is to study the guides thoroughly, make yourself notes, a step by step to-do list and some heavy research via the evo forums, TCF and The MonkeyBusiness FAQ. If you still have questions after that, Moka and I will be here to give our best in making everything perfectly clear to you. _______________ Thanks everyone for your attention, support and feedback and apologies for the wall of text.

I see that you say one week might be over zealous but reading Prince Oberyn's ""The Grand MonkeyBusiness FAQ"" it states: ""Using the jungle money methods, you can realistically make back the cost of the full guide in just one or two transactions/ one or two days"" followed by a contradictory statement: ""Build a progressive transaction history over the course of 2-8 weeks. Do daily transfers below 10$ and then move up slowly until approx. 500$. It's recommended to send and receive funds on a daily basis to give your account an active transaction history."" Maybe I am misunderstanding but how can the cost be recuperated in one or two days if a transaction history needs to be established over the course of 2-8 weeks?

Figured this seemed like a good place for my first post. I have no experience with carding/cvv but I'm a quick learner. I've got some coding experience and enough funds to dive in. Besides a lack of knowledge and experience, the main thing that would hold me back is paranoia but I guess you develop some comfort level over time. I'm also very skeptical. I don't doubt the veracity of the reviews here but I'm a little concerned that I might be showing up to this party pretty late since the guide was first released back in Aug (and I'm sure PP has been exploited far longer than that). Has PP gotten better at shutting this down? On the subject of Cashoutmoney / Transfer Services: why are they willing to sell money for 25 cents when they could keep all of it themselves? Do they just have a ton more CVV than PP accounts? Why don't they buy every PP account on DW? One last question... being the noob that I am, would you recommend starting with JungleMoney first and building up with 4 Horsemen later? I read the faq and understand that JungleMoney is more accessible. I guess I'm wondering how much overlap there is between the two. I have no idea what a fraudulent e-commerce platform even looks like. I'm afraid trying to process all that info at once would be overload. But I'd be willing to if it meant greater security / success.  Sorry for noob. Thanks for help!",""

"Evolution Forums","d33poutside","6531","2014-04-03T15:51:36","Word of Warning -- All versions of PGP are NOT created equal","Security & Anonymity","Copied from Sr forum and credit goes to OC. The version lines that are usually shown by default in PGP keys and PGP signature blocks, often reveal which OS the person is using. PGP/GPG Version strings: You can tell a fair bit about a user's PGP/GPG setup from their Version: string. Here are some typical examples: Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux) This key belongs to a Linux user. Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32) This key belongs to a Windows user. Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin) This key belongs to a Mac OS X user. Versions that should make you nervous: Version: 9.9.0.397 This person is using the official PGP version, as published by Symantec. I've read statements by Kevin Mitnick that he no longer trusts PGP, since it was acquired by Symantec.   In his post, Mitnick refers to the case of Diskreet, which back in the early days, was an encryption package sold by Symantec. This software purported to use the full 56-bit DES cipher algorithm, which was quite strong for its day. Mitnick stated that he acquired a copy of the Diskreet source code, and discovered that the actual key was nowhere near 56-bits, but was incredibly weak. He went on to say that based on his experience, he would not trust any version of PGP published by Symantec. His caution is only underscored by the Snowden revelations earlier this Summer, which set out the NSA's campaign of attempting to weaken or backdoor crypto.I, for one, would not trust any closed-source crypto software published by an American company -- that goes double for companies with a history like Symantec. To the best of my knowledge, Symantec does not publish PGP source code, and as an American company, their crypto software is now suspect. Versions of PGP  that should make you run away screaming: Versions of PGP with these Version: strings are based on the BouncyCastle Java crypto libraries. They should be avoided like the plague. Version: BCPG v1.45Version: BCPG v1.47 These versions of PGP are absolutely NOTORIOUS for generating MASSIVELY UNSAFE PGP keys by default. These versions typically generate DSS/Elgamal keyswith signing keys with a size of 1024-bits, and an encryption sub-key of as little as 512-bits. 512-bit keys are so unsafe, that they were being broken by hobbyists on spare hardware a dozen years ago. 1024-bit keys were deprecated by NIST more than 3 years ago. Version: BCPG C# v1.6.1.0Copied from SR2 forums and credit goes to OP.  This version of PGP generates by default a PGP key of 1024-bits, with NO encryption sub-key. Again, these keys are unsafe/obsolete. Recommendations: Any software that uses the Java Bouncycastle crypto libraries (like PortablePGP) should be avoided like the plague. These typically contain BCPG in the Version: string. GPG4Win/Kleopatra/GPA are also deprecated -- Kleopatra generates RSA keys without an encryption sub-key. Dual RSA keys, with one RSA key for signing, and the other exclusively for encryption have been standard since the Fall of 2009.GPA will not generate keys over 3072-bits in length. GPG4USB or Gnu Privacy Tray (GnuPT) are recommended, as they are: * Easy to use * Standards compliant GnuPT, in particular, is frequently updated. Usually, when there is a new GPG version (e.g. 1.4.15), the GnuPT developers issue an update with a day or two, reflecting the change. Download links: GPG4USB: http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/index.html",""

I'm not 100% sure if it applies to PGP keys but since its related to encryption I wanted to put this out there.  Besides, if you use ecryptfs this is good to know because when mounting your directory/partition it asks if you want to use AES with 16, 24, or 32 key bytes (128, 192, 256 bits respectively)   ** CLEARNET **https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.htmltl;dr: if given the option, use AES128 (AES with 16 key bytes)  PS: Out of curiosity, is there another algorithm that's better than AES?   I think he was referring the insecurity of downloading executables from Tor because it's theoretically possible for a server or Tor node to send you malicious data instead of the actual file you were trying to download.  You are absolutely correct. NEVER download any executables from Tor. NEVER accept JavaScript or Java applets when using Tor. Personally, as a general rule, I would never use a PGP key that was *not* generated by myself on my own computer. There's no telling who else has access to it if someone else created it for you.This also ties into what I was saying above: anything that's executed on your computer (.exe's, linux executables, javascript, java applets, etc) should Never be used/executed when you're on Tor  Here's how you guys can create a PGP key w/ 4096 bits: The process might be the same for Windows if there's a Windows version of gpg.

Its interesting I have been reading gwern's site a fair bit and he lists all the DNM arrests to date across all countries and jurisdictions.  Apart from site administrators and mods, almost 85% of all LE take downs of vendors or buyers have been when they import drugs or contraband from another country.  The only exclusion to this would be the US where it would seem some buyers really are just unlucky and maybe one or two instances in the UK.",""

What does the method contain?The method contains all you need to know to cashout hacked paypal accounts, it contains step-by-step info on creating the necessarry assets (middle-man/ghost account, making it usable for big funds), cleaning the funds, cashing them out safely and without worries.

"Evolution Forums","BASICALLY","47966","2015-02-06T19:01:32","WARNING: Browser Security Hole Detected","Security & Anonymity","/////////// TEXT FROM NORDVPN.COM ///////////  Recently the research was announced on Reddit, claiming that Firefox and Chrome browsers for Windows have huge security hole which may cause the real IP address leak, even when using a VPN. The detailed information about this security hole can be found in Github website here: https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips Here is what Github claim about this security hole:  âFirefox and Chrome have implemented WebRTC that allow requests to STUN servers be made that will return the local and public IP addresses for the user. These request results are available to javascript, so you can now obtain a users local and public IP addresses in javascript. This demo is an example implementation of that. Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery. This makes these types of requests available for online tracking if an advertiser sets up a STUN server with a wildcard domain.â  In short, the IP check method that is used by Firefox and Chrome browsers allows websites to reveal the real ISP issued IP address. It is claimed that websites can determine the actual IP address by running a WebRTC JavaScript code within the web browser without the visitor knowing about it. However, this security hole was only detected in Windows Firefox and Chrome browsers and no IP leaks were discovered for Android, Linux and Mac OS versions.  Since this security hole can affect many VPN users, we strongly recommend to read the following information, explaining how to overcome this issue by taking few simple steps:  Chrome for Windows.If you use Chrome browser for Windows, we recommend you to install the free browser extension, which you can find here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-block/nphkkbaidamjmhfanlpblblcadhfbkdm?hl=en After you install the extension, it is recommended to test if WebRTC was disabled. In order to do that, you should visit Browserleaks website and check if the WebRTC is enabled or disabled.   Firefox for Windows.In case of disabling WebRTC in Firefox for Windows, you should make few more steps. At first you will need to type âabout:configâ into the URL bar and press enter. Then look for âmedia.peerconnection.enabledâ and double click to set it to ""false"". ////////////////////////////////////////////////  Here you can test if your real IP could be leaked or not (this is scary):https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/

Iâm quite new to all of this dark web criminal activity business, but so far I find it rather fascinating and Iâm particularly a bit intrigued by the all the vendors who are offering paypal money transfer services. Intuitively it seems almost too good to be true to pay less money and receive more, does anyone have any idea about just how big the risk is and what would happen if you get caught receiving money from services like this? Or overall if anyone has experiences from doing it and could talk about how it works? And Iâm not sure If there is a standard way of âwashingâ the money, but I thought of one method that in my mind seems to be pretty safe: 1.    Get a VNP on the outside of TOR, so you have TOR>VPN which I guess would hide the fact that you are using TOR from paypal and your ISP and others so it doesnât look suspicious. Plus it should be even safer than just TOR right? If anyone contacts the VPN provider all they would be able to get out is the TOR IP address right? 2.    Buy a pre-verified paypal account from a vendor on dark web. This account should then only be accessed behind TOR>VPN so that paypal never has a log of your personal IP-address using the account.  3.    Receive the dirty cash on the paypal account and then buy linden Dollars with paypal on VirWox.com. You donât need to send id or anything to verify a Virwox account so I guess if an account is created behind Tor>VPN with a fake name and email it should have no trail leading back to you? There is a pretty low limit to how much you are allowed to buy each month from paypal but I guess you could use several accounts. 4.    Sell the linden dollars for bitcoins on Virwox and withdraw the bitcoins to your wallet on the dark web for example on Evolution. Not that I know at all how bitcoin transfers leave trails but Iâm assuming if Virwox sends it to evolution or some other dark web wallet it doesnât have any personal connection to you? And to see where the bitcoins went from the dark web wallet someone would have to access the Evolution server? 5.    Send the bitcoins from the dark web market wallet to your personal bitcoin wallet and do whatever you want with them, for example buy normal currency and put the money on your bank. The money should now have no connection to the original paypal cash at all and since the only step that involves your real personal accounts/IP is the last one then nothing should be leading back to you? Is this how it works or am I retarded when it comes to internet trails/security and this is totally traceable? Iâm pretty short on cash so it would be nice if this was possible, but getting caught is not really an option in my life right now. So how safe is this?",""
"Evolution Forums","dopeman419","55710","2015-03-17T00:00:00","Re: Transform dirty palpal cash to bitcoins without anything leading back?","Security & Anonymity","It's an ideal setup, one problem with virwox I hear is that it takes up to 3 days for first time paypal buyers. So if the PP owner reports it in that time, the account will be toast for you. Another option would be to use your real paypal account, but make sure nothing leads back to you (tor, vpn, possibly tails or VM) and then just claim unauthorized payment in a few days after all is well and good. I would avoid logging into your paypal account for a few days before attempting this. It requires some money to start, but you will get everything back AND the btc. You won't even need to call paypal if done correctly; you can just log in and one click ""unauthorized transaction"" and they will side with you no question if you did everything correctly. Be sure to use a VM or TAILS for this to avoid the flash cookies. Also beware that paypal uses ""beacans"" in their emails, so disable images if reading paypal emails on a different IP. They can link/ track you that way! You can also just look for someone on bitcointalk.org privately to scam with the paypal unauthorized shit. Make an account and post for a while, and then attempt to buy some bitcoins from someone for paypal at a marked up price. Greedy people will make the trade, and you win! Can use your own paypal account, or hacked accounts if you want to go that route.",""

I already knew things in the guide and they are working. I waited a little more info, but the main things are there and i'm sure Heinrich will answer all your questions, if you will have them. Method used is very good.  BUT Saw also other vendors selling ""opening new cc"", and i don't know for how much time this method will work easy. Of course, with a little creativity, you can make everything to work forever, but i'm feeling this have a big chance to get saturated, because a lot of newbies are trying to it by themselves, without carding knowledges or without knowing how to do it properly. So Heinrich bro, my advice is to rise the price. 200 $ was a good price, minimum 150 $.",""

I'll teach you how to take any  good  high credit fullz, and turn it into a high limit credit card under the card-holders name. Fresh to your drop, really easy and simple. The investment, is really small. Almost nothing. I will also discuss methods of cashing these cards out to cash, and other means.  Price, will be 100$ for a limited time. And I will teach you the following:  a) A Good Fullz Vendor for thisb) Operational security c) Getting the credit card to your dropd) Cashing out  The process and time it takes to invest into this method and get the card on the way for each fullz is low, around a hour with a 85% success rate if you have good data. And I've gotten cards with limits as high as 10k never less than 3k once I started getting consistent data. This method, is quite simple and could be ideally be executed by anybody with a basic understanding of a carding setup. Along with this method comes a few hours of consultation time in case you were to run into and issues or fail to have a understanding of the detailed but simple breakdown contained in the guide. Once you get a good system rolling, you can be cashing out 20, 30, 40k a month. It's quite possible with a crew and focused coordination. You'll be able to purchase things with these cards, you'll receive the pins to these cards, you'll be able to get cash-back with this cards.  Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/101899

Its next to impossible to get a cardto another drop without Chase or Citibank or Capital One or any of the US banks not calling the card holderright away if there is a new card out or address change or wtv change. And they can call any number likecellular or work or business. So its all by luck. Then any new uses it gets flagged. So in the US how canyou say this works. You have to be a expert and gifted carder.","SPARTANZ wrote:Ok, so i received guide.I already knew things in the guide and they are working.

Of course, with a little creativity, you can make everything to work forever, but i'm feeling this have a big chance to get saturated, because a lot of newbies are trying to it by themselves, without carding knowledges or without knowing how to do it properly. So Heinrich bro, my advice is to rise the price. 200 $ was a good price, minimum 150 $."

It's 700-800$ a day in cash you're pulling off of mycash codes. And we all know there is a 325$ investment for one. So 325+325=650 First day you will make 50$ profit and the second round is all profit. There are a few ways to do this, regards to getting the business debit. Cashing out thousands at a time is also possible, just requires a little mor investment in resources as of the moment i been executing and making way better money with the fullz to cc method. Honestly my money is so good right now i dont have to do a damn thing i can sit in my shower all day jacking off for the rest of my life and my bills will just remain paid and somebody will continue to bring my meals to me and ill continue to jack off to my statments I'm good you guys arent im trying to be helpful

This will be even faster after you get familiar with the process-The minimum you should be able to clear per day when you have intentions on repeating it daily is $600-There isn't really a maximum you can clear per day, but any general rule to avoid saturation goes. What you will need:-CCs-Fullz-Emails (new)-Phone numbers (almost any internet service will do)-ID scans/template (They may or may not ask you for an ID scan. Any DL/Passport/ID will do. The quality doesn't have to be super. I've passed it on 2 occasions with tremendous errors in it when I was trying this method. It was fine for them. Why do I sell it:For the obvious reasons I've moved on to other very much alike methods. Currently there is no real risk of saturation for this. I'm limiting this to 5 people. The price is justified by both the amount of money that can be cleared daily and the fact that I want to see this saturated as much as you do. I believe that people who are willing to invest these types of money are not the ones leaking it and reselling it for 10% of the cost.

There's really not much more to say other than this works :-) However, for those who like a more detailed review:The method itself is a multi-step process like many others, but he found a way to save time in the converting process and by doing so upping the success rate. There basically is no time for the banks to do a chargeback as you're money will not be stuck for ages (like virwox/target etc). Security isn't too good either. I initially tried two deposits for $300 which both got through within 10 minutes or so. I followed what he told me to do on IM, got everything ready for the first time and I had btc sent to me in little over 40 minutes after that. With these deposits I didn't need verification, but when I did a $500 deposit later, they had me do some verification with ID scan. I've sent them an email with the ID scan and they responded within an hour or so. The scan was accepted and they released the funds immediately. I had 2 failing cards after that and called it quits for today.  All in all, it works. The sales cap you put on it is good and the price you put on it should keep most people without a clue at bay. Your reasons for the price are good and you're free to do so. As with all multi-step process methods you lose a percentage here and there, but generally speaking you will receive about 55-65% of the funds if I understand it correctly. Without too much effort I've received $650 in BTC so the method does work. I also think it's safe to say even beginners shouldn't have too much trouble doing this. It's not country restricted in any way and no phone conversations are needed. Basic carding security setup + CCs are required mostly. This can and will surely be daily repeated by me.  Good find, thanks for the method and good luck with sales :-)",""

On your computer encrypt it with full drive encryption, use a password at least 40+ characters long (mine is 60+) sentences are good with special characters, capitalization. Spaces also mess up brute force methods.  Now on your completely clean computer, I create another encrypted container with TrueCrypt. Install VMWare Workstation and your operating system, now on the operating system in the encrypted container use full drive encryption on the Virtual Machine as-well with a completely different password.  So you should have this setup -;  Your encrypted computer -> VMWare Workstation with an Full Drive Encrypted Machine (Different Password) Now on your computer itself, (not on VMWare) you want to install a VPN Service, I recommend one you can pay with Bitcoin, one that appreciates privacy. This will encrypt all your traffic on the main computer, just as a pre-cauction, then do the EXACT same on the Virtual Machine, but use a different VPN provider.  This provides a fail proof system in case one fails, be it on the main computer, or the virtual one, then a remote PC with another Virtual PC. Ideally you want a VPN router but people who travel or do it from laptop don't always have this option.  NOW, you simply login to your system and set your Virtual Machine to full screen mode. This is now your safe PC inside a PC. Both encrypted.  This is now optional, but I buy a remote Windows VPS or Dedicated Server, and then put a Virtual Machine inside there on an encrypted mounted container and fully encrypt that AGAIN on a different VPN. So now it looks like this. Encrypted PC -> VPN Connection <- Encrypted Virtual PC -> VPN Connection -> Remote Desktop PC -> Remote Encrypted Virtual Machine in Full Screen Mode with a VPN.  Do everything from there, run your TOR browser or whatever you have to do, you can use that for proxies. You are seriously distanced from ANYTHING. I don't think any law enforcement would be able to follow that especially if your using high privacy VPN's - the first place they would find is ONLY if 1 of 3 of your VPN providers gave it up. The encrypted Virtual Machine in an encrypted file container on the Remote Desktop PC that is on a VPN, if police seized that it would have nothing on it, as you did everything in an encrypted container, with a virtual machine in there, nothing to see. They are stuffed, so next they look at connections made to the Remote Desktop PC, that is done from another VPN provider - they are absolutely stuffed now. Lets say even if the bloody NSA found out who connected to that remote desktop, you did it from your encrypted Virtual PC on your PC, that is again encrypted and behind the first VPN. In short there is NO chance of them getting you. Tell me if anyone sees a flaw in this? It seems pretty fool proof to me. Even if they were to grab your PC itself instead of tracing it, you gave them the password or they got it whilist it was on, they dont have the encrypted container with the Virtual PC running, and even if they got into that you did everything from a Remote Desktop PC, if they got onto that once again another encrypted container running a Virtual PC.  This also gives you the ability if you are caught to delete/terminate the Remote Desktop PC even if they seized your computers leaving no trace of you. In short this is my setup -;  VPN -> Your encrypted PC -> Encrypted Container -> Virtual Encrypted PC -> VPN -> Remote Desktop -> Encrypted Container ->  Virtual Encrypted PC -> VPN -> Crime Perhaps a little heavy yes, but your covered at every angle I can see? Even if your arrested, if you pay for your remote desktop monthly, by the time any serious investigation or brute force attempts against your computer is made, it would have expired. Or you will be out, and can transfer the encrypted container with the Virtual machine everything is done on elsewhere. Evidence gone, never was there.  Feel like I've mumbled on a bit.

"Evolution Forums","Assholio","22004","2014-09-02T05:38:42","Re: Staying safe as a Vendor","Security & Anonymity","Jail time for refusing to comply with mandatory key disclosure hasnât occurred in the United States yet. But, itâs already happening in jurisdictions such as the UK, where a 33-year-old man was incarcerated for refusing to turn over his decryption keys and a youth was jailed for not disclosing a 50-character encryption password to authorities. Similarly harsh, key disclosure laws also exist in Australia and South Africa which compel individuals to surrender cryptographic keys to law enforcement without regard for the usual common law protection against self-incrimination. Key disclosure laws may become the most important government tool in asset seizures and the war on money laundering. When charged with a criminal offense, that refers to the ability of the government to demand that you surrender your private encryption keys that decrypt your data. If your data is currency such as access control to various amounts of bitcoin on the block chain, then you have surrendered your financial transaction history and potentially the value itself. These laws will impact not only money laundering prosecution but almost any asset protection strategy that attempts to maintain an element of financial privacy such as private banking or family trusts. Prior to all these money laundering laws being enacted, I once heard it said that the practice of moving money around was simply referred to as banking. Doug Casey famously said that âitâs a completely artificial crime. It wasnât even heard of 20 years ago, because the âcrimeâ didnât exist.â Furthermore he said, âThe War on Drugs may be where âmoney launderingâ originated as a crime, but today it has a lot more to do with something infinitely more important to the state: the War on Tax Evasion.â And, if they canât track it from the outside via the banks and financial institutions, theyâll track it from the inside via access to an individualâs passwords and private keys. In the United States, relevant case law has revolved around the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination as there is currently no specific law regarding key disclosure. The definition of a password is alarmingly broad too â all the way from an extension of your personal memory to an illegitimate tool that only hides something tangible from law enforcement. The first case to address directly the question of whether a person can be compelled to reveal his or her encryption keys or password was In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher in 2009. Here a magistrate judge ruled that producing the passphrase for the encrypted hard drive would constitute self-incrimination, but on appeal the District Court overturned that decision, holding that decrypting and producing the complete contents would not constitute self-incrimination since Boucher initially cooperated in showing some of the computer files to border agents. Next, there was the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu in 2010 in which the Federal District Court ordered a criminal defendant to decrypt the contents of an encrypted laptop. Although the defendant claimed Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed an amicus curiae brief, the Court sided with the government in ruling that since defendant admitted to ownership of the laptop and knowledge of the passwords in a recorded conversation, the existence of evidence was a âforgone conclusionâ and therefore Fifth Amendment privilege could not be implicated. In early 2012, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an appeal and let that decision stand. In a blog post, Orin Kerr cited In re Weiss (703 F. 2d 653) in summarizing testimonial obduracy and what a future Courtâs likely posture would be if defendant refuses to comply with a key disclosure order or claims to have forgotten the password. On the specific Fifth Amendment issue in United States v. Fricosu, Kerr states:     If Iâm reading Fricosu correctly, the Court is not saying that there is no Fifth Amendment privilege against being forced to divulge a password. Rather, the Court is saying that the Fifth Amendment privilege canât be asserted in a specific case where it is known based on the facts of the case that the computer belongs to the suspect and the suspect knows the password. Because the only incriminating message of being forced to decrypt the password â that the suspect has control over the computer â is already known, it is a âforegone conclusionâ and the Fifth Amendment privilege cannot block the governmentâs application. In another case upholding the constitutional right against forced decryption, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Doe on February 24th, 2012 overturned a contempt of court ruling for refusing to decrypt. Arguing that without any specific knowledge of a hard driveâs file contents or file existence, the government cannot assert that certain items can be described with âreasonable particularityâ and therefore compelling a defendant to produce those files would violate the Fifth Amendmentâs protection against self-incrimination. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which again filed an amicus curiae brief in the case, called it a major victory for constitutional rights in the digital age. To say the cryptocurrency bitcoin is disruptive would be an understatement. Bitcoin not only disrupts payments and monetary sovereignty, it also disrupts the legal enforcement of anti-money laundering laws, asset seizure, and capital controls. It is very likely that a key disclosure case will make it to the U.S. Supreme Court where it is far from certain that the Fifth Amendment privilege, as it relates to a refusal to decrypt bitcoin assets, will be universally upheld. Many observers have suggested defensive techniques that deploy TrueCrypt disk encryption with hidden volume partitions or PGP Whole Disk Encryption rendering the entire computer unbootable thereby making even file time and date stamps unavailable. Another legal strategy to complicate matters could be to split the passphrase with another person and claim that you are never in possession of the entire real passphrase. Then, at least there would be âplausible deniabilityâ as to who provided the invalid portion of the passphrase or you would have a cellmate if held in contempt.",""

However, the federal case In re Boucher may be influential as case law. In this case, a man's laptop was inspected by customs agents and child pornography was discovered. The device was seized and powered-down, at which point disk encryption technology made the evidence unavailable. The judge argued that since the content had already been seen by the customs agents, Boucher's encryption password ""adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information.""[22] In another case, a district court judge ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case: âI conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer,â Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled on January 23, 2012.[23] However, in United States v. Doe, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled on 24 February 2012 that forcing the decryption of one's laptop violates the Fifth Amendment.[24][25] The Federal Bureau of Investigation may also issue national security letters that require the disclosure of keys for investigative purposes.[26] One company, Lavabit, chose to shut down rather than surrender its master private keys.",""

FRIM I'd expect you to know this, your default mac address is stored in the hardware of your wireless card not your OS, so if LE get hold of your wireless card and see the MAC address is the same as the one that committed the crime then you're busted. If you spoofed it then that MAC address value is stored on your encrypted OS where they can't get it, and they will see the default MAC address on the wireless card is different to the one that committed the crime, that's the whole point of spoofing! And no it can't in any way fuck up your wireless adapter permanently, all that can happen is you put in an invalid MAC address in some cases in windows so you change it again or click use default.

For Darknet activities;Burner laptop > OS kali Linux (drive encrypted with Truecrypt 7.1a) > hacked wifi > VPN > Virtual box > Tails  > Tor  Does tails still create a ramdrive if it is run through a VM?  Are these setups safe? Can anyone tell me where I can improve or if I need to? I will be vending Prepaid cards to start with.  2. I have be searching online but can't seem to find an exact answer. Bitcoin addresses and IP's, how hard are they to link? After I receive funds from a transaction on Evo is this a safe withdrawal method.  Evo > tumbler > tumbler > offline wallet such as Electrum or Multibit? The wallet will be stored on an encrypted usb within a encrypted hidden volume and hidden in a very safe location. Are two tumblers needed? Any information regarding my questions is appreciated.

Spoof MAC address because every wireless router you connect to can see this and stores it in its logs, and worst of all the default address is built into your network card. If you spoof it then it'll use a MAC address different to the one built into your network card.","Treekle wrote:For clearnet activities;Burner laptop > OS kali Linux (drive encrypted with Truecrypt 7.1a) > hacked wifi > VPN > Virtual box > Windows XP > VPN > Sock5With regards to hacked wifi, the further the wifi is from you the better?"

Using it, u will mainly be using the command prompt. If u want, u can make a bootable usb and boot from that. The good thing about that is it saves everything to the usb so all ur info is mobile and can be encrypted too. If you're really para, u can remove ur hdd and boot from the usb. I prefer to use xubuntu on usb because it's much easier than debian, but debian is more secure. From the usb u can use vms too. U can set the usb to live mode where it doesn't even save to the usb.

A previous case on self-incrimination (financial fraud or some such - the guy was forced to answer questions on pain of contempt) at the European Court of Human Rights ruled against the UK government and UK courts leading to a 75k payout though the judgment included words that suggested some self-incrimination might be permitted (e.g. owner of a vehicle must say who was driving if caught by a speeding camera). I think the law in our case is closest to the former rather than the speeding violation and so is probably not compliant with article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the ECHR and so will likely be overturned/modified (or repealed) in the future. The law is primariy aimed at pedophiles anyway so its a bit shit its being used for everything.

You can rape this until the wheels fall off. This method will require an account verification, so that'll take a few hours then you can begin raping, and no it's not hard to get it verified. I can guarantee this method has not been seen on this market, or any other DN site. Due to the privacy of this method, the prices will get jacked up every sale, and I'll be selling very limited copies. This was written and founded by reckless2030 & myself. So to wrap this summary up, get it while you can. Requirments:â  Working CCVâ  SOCKSâ  Fake Verification Scan (Find .PSDs, or find a service here on Evo)â  Internet Access Price: $100.00The price is going to be increased by $25.00 each sale, until it reaches $200 a copy, then I'll finish selling it.I'll be offering a vouch copy for 75% off (does not count as first sale), and the user must be trustworthy. This guide is saturated, so once the raping starts, you better buy the method before it's not possible anymore.  Reviews:N/A If you have any questions about the method, I can't reveal to much, but message me here, the marketplace, or on ICQ, which is posted below, thank you and have a wonderful day.

So I'm going to tell you quickly how I feel about this guide. It has two pages on a PDF file with some tips in the beginning part. The method itself is not cleared and not very detailed. When you attempt this method you'll get some confusions for sure. At a step, you will be surprised that the method is mostly just a copy and paste work from the target BTC site LOL and that was so funny IMO. I couldn't follow the method to the end as there are some requirements that I don't want to waste my time on it. Something like building reputation before getting $50 each transaction is just not my way. Anyway, good luck on the sale and thanks for $10 discount. At least I didn't pay in full",""

Like previous user said if you want a get rich quick scheme this is not for you, you will burn the method and everyone that paid for it. I am leaving for multiple months to backpack the world and it seemed like the perfect solution to have a steady income. The method will take some time to set up correctly but that's nothing compared to the profit that can be made, A few hours a week will get you a nice income. It also seem very expensive but let me tell you that it worth every penny, a few more bucks to invest to get started. As for the saturation part, Ofc it will eventually get saturated/company will up their security but how long will it take will all depend on the amount of people that buy/leak the method and is impossible to predict.

Considering a notable benefit of my method is the fact that it takes, at most, 6 hours per week, I would realistically place an upper limit on returns at 15k/week (by chaining three instances of the method at once). Taking both the amount of time required as well as the data management involved into account, that would be the most I would recommend for a single person operation. As for saturation, considering I am pulling this method for sale after a couple more students, I don't forsee this method becoming saturated/burning any time soon. Unless those who have been taught the method were to leak it (which is not in their own best interest), I would estimate this being viable for at least a year from now, if not longer.","goforbillion wrote:Bongos, what its the max potential of this if you keep working hard and reinvesting? how much per week/month?

Henceforth, the tutoring will be necessary to successfully implement the method as information will be given and expanded upon as the actual time passes during the method application. Essentially, I will not provide you a overall instruction at the beginning, but instead walk you through each step as they arise with direct support (already included in the tutoring service). This will allow students to still effectively implement the method without being a copy/paste ""guide"", which this was never meant to be.","Z0l4f wrote:Bongos, please be careful.

Unlike those you mentioned, there is consistent, clean money to be made here. While your opinion will always be yours to hold, I'd see no instance of anyone ""falling"" for anything. Those who have made the investment and those who have been taught for free all concur that this is a legitimate cashout avenue that produces results unlike anything else you can find here. Yasuo can confirm that he has prior experience with MLM, and even Amway directly. If this were just a rehash of the old and know, he would've pointed it out. If you'd like to know more about the method and how it differs from Amway and the like, regardless if you're interested in the tutoring, feel free to PM me. While there's no doubt that the tutoring is generally considered expensive, the return on the investment is more than able to justify the price. Those who have been taught by myself will all be able to remake their investment is a reasonable amount of time, and with a consistency that isn't comparable to any other method of money making you see people attempting here.

Before alphawolf89 performed his little exit, this was the last legitimate product he offered before his fake Venmo cashout transfers. Since learning the method, I have tweaked and improved it (with some assistance from Yasuo) and am now offering it as well. However unlike alphawolf89, I work completely within escrow, have legitimate reviews and sales, and actually deliver on what I'm offering. If you're still interested in learning like you were back then, from a more reliable Vendor, feel free to contact me and we can discuss whatever you'd like.

I'm very interested in this method and have the funds to invest. One thing that concerns me is this scenario. When you are banging $5000+ in sales in a week...that's about 100 people you are billing. Now imagine in a day,20 of them, calling the company saying that these charges were not authorized. The company starts to get nervous.  The company will shut you down very quick!  What I'm asking is, what is the descriptor on the client's bank statement?If it shows a toll free number and the company's name...they will be calling them in droves....just when you are about to make serious $$$.

"Evolution Forums","bongos","42455","2015-01-31T06:25:18","Re: [5k USD/Week] Multi-Level Marketing 100% Clean Cashout [Multi-Vouched]","Guides Vendors","Hello, mate! I understand your concern about what you described, but fortunately your situation is a bit off. You stated an estimated 100 charges, but that is much higher than what you'll be processing using the method; you'll have to worry about less than half of those, actually. As for the chargeback part of the scenario, due to the type of business and size/nature of the charge made, chargebacks are near non-existent. Additionally, in the off chance that chargebacks do happen, due to the nature of business and the policies of the MLM company used, the company sides with the affiliate (you) in 100% of those instances removing any negative effects that chargebacks bring in other cashout methods. So to ease your concerns, that situation never happens which ensures you'll be able to bring in solid streams of income consistently without any scenario like you described occuring. For a direct example, consider the following information and outcome which was provided by Yasuo after his initial test run with the method. Yasuo charged 10 CCs, all of which were in his control (owned by him, not ATO'd or stolen). Of these 10 cards, he personally forced chargebacks on 3 of them to see the results on both the cashout and companies' response. He found that the charge and cashout still processed successfully, and he informed me that he had no issues/contact with the company. Now this is just one brief example (you may see more details on this situation once he posts his follow-up), but that is how the situation you described above is handled. No issues, and free flowing cashout. Also just to answer the question about the bank statement, only the company name is displayed, not a phone number.  If this sufficiently disperses your concerns, or if you have any further questions, feel free to PM/Jabber me so that we can begin working together. I look forward to hearing from you, mate.","crazybank wrote:Hi Everyone. I'm very interested in this method and have the funds to invest. One thing that concerns me is this scenario. When you are banging $5000+ in sales in a week...that's about 100 people you are billing. Now imagine in a day,20 of them, calling the company saying that these charges were not authorized. The company starts to get nervous. The company will shut you down very quick! What I'm asking is, what is the descriptor on the client's bank statement?If it shows a toll free number and the company's name...they will be calling them in droves....just when you are about to make serious $$$.Please let me know what you think.."

There is theoretically no limit to how much you could cash out each week, even above 5k, but recommendations will be discussed during tutoring to stay below the radar. The service will be offered in the form of live tutoring via Jabber+OTR, and support will be provided for the first week to cashout (as there's nothing new after that point). Tutoring will cover step by step instructions on how to successfully input data to cashout directly to your bank account. The service is specifically for US members, but it CAN be used worldwide with the use of a high quality set of USA Fullz as well as a secure US bank drop. US members can cashout directly to their legitimate bank account, so no need for any of the previously mentioned. I offer two tiers of tutoring, both of which have clean cashouts, although the higher tier significantly lowers the amount of work as it makes the process semi-autopilot. Price is 5k USD for the standard method and 7k USD for the autopilot method (available under shipping options). Payment is released upon completion of the tutoring and after all questions are answered by the student. When placing an order, include your Jabber in the notes section.  SPECIAL NOTE FOR EXPERIENCED FRAUDSTERS: If you're interested in the information used in the method, but not the tutoring entirely (because you have excessive prior experience and/or believe you can deduce the method yourself), I can offer the company/URL as well as the required setup information for a discounted price of 2k USD. Due to this being offered exclusively to those who are experienced, I am open to exchanges of information in place of part/whole of the cash price. If you are interested and feel you have information worth trading for, please PM me.    Terms of Tutoring:-I am responsible for providing support up until your first cashout (maximum 14 days time)-I am obligated to answer any questions you may have regarding the method during and after the tutoring-I am NOT responsible if you burn your account by going against my recommendations-I am NOT responsible if you are unsuccessful for any other reason-I am NOT responsible for providing you with materials for the cashout, only the knowledge of how to do it-Escrow must be released upon completion of tutoring-You are not permitted to leave negative/neutral feedback if you do not like the method, only if the method does not work-By beginning the tutoring you are accepting all of the terms and my refund policy Please contact ""bongos"" for all messages, this account will not be monitored.

And to clarify things, this is not Amway, it doesn't pay as good as Amway but it does pay out.I have discussed some methods with bongos to make this operation semi-autopilot and how to maximize profits. I have charged my prepaid debits on this and will force a couple of chargebacks to see how it responds to chargebacks. However, upon reading further on the site's policy on chargebacks, I believe they're foreseeing that a chargeback is inevitable and they offer good benefit towards their affiliate.Bottom line is, it works, however the profit margin is small on the basic tier. If you are creative, then you might make money from this and ROI is around 3-4 cashouts(safe). MLM is a big niche, it all depends on your creativity to be completely honest. Bongos said that there's no saturation to this, however, seeing as to what happened to Amway, there will still be saturation to anything as long as you abuse it and how many people abuse it. It doesn't matter if the company is small or big, saturation will be achieved at any point.Like Amazon, they're doing more steps to prevent fraudulent order claims at the moment. They may not be able to solve it right away, but they'll solve it soon. My suggestion is, learn from this, be creative, make money, and then explore the same niche but make yourself open with a lot of options. Remember, it's never about the speed of making money, it's about consistency.;cratz wrote:I purchased this from Bongos and I want to share my experience with the community. I want to be clear that although I didn't pay the full $5,000 tuition for this tutoring, I still invested a significant amount for it - and it was worth every penny.My main reason for purchasing this from Bongos was mainly for tax purposes. Because of the fact that I'm now earning money that can't be traced back to anything in the ""real world"", I needed something I could do legitimately that would show me having a decent income. Enter Bongos. This method is fairly simple. The profit margins are a bit on the lower side at first, however that can and will quickly change the longer you implement this strategy. The MLM in question has been around for a while and my main concern was chargebacks. However as Yasuo pointed out, in the Terms and Policies - they pretty much point to ""no ability to chargeback"". Spending only 2-3 hours, one day per week, will make you - easily - $3k per week. One of the biggest points that will make this entire thing work for you is not getting greedy in the beginning. Bongos stressed the importance of building up your ""sales"" slowly so you don't raise any red flags. I'm a huge promoter of safety. Maybe too much. If you get flagged because you decided to be an idiot and run as fast as you can with this, then that's entirely your fault. I have made 2 affiliate accounts to start, and will be growing this ""business"" for my family. I went over the numbers with Bongos, and by the time May/June 2015 comes around, I'll be making $8k-$10k per week between both accounts. If you're on the fence about this - don't be. Look at this like an investment. Like any good investment, it will take some time to see a return. However unlike most investments that take years to pay you back - that won't be the case with this. I'll make my money back within 3 months - taking my time. By this time next year - as long as this strategy hasn't gotten burned - I will have made over $300,000. That doesn't include what I'll make in year 2, year 3, year 4 etc.$5,000 today to learn the knowledge to make $300,000+...hmmm...seems like a no brainer to me. Now if only college was able to pay huge dividends like this...I'd be a millionaire.;AlfonseSimone wrote:OK guys.  This is my first ever review.First, I would like to echo what cratz had said in his detailed reviewed.  As described in the OP, this is something you cannot go gangbusters on from day 1 or risk being flagged.  So with that said, I cannot give a review on my expected gains 4 weeks from now.  But as it is all explained to me, and from my experience in the continuity billing business (on the legimate side), this has real gains to be realized.Let me expand on what Yas and Alpha had said earlier before I begin.  It may say on the MLM site no chargebacks allowed.  But much like any vendor on EVO can put in their terms whatever they want (FE early, etc), that doesn't make it ""legal.""  My view is that the MLM puts that on the site as a scare tactic but the fact is any reputable merchant will side with the bank and consumer on a digital no signature purchase.  Further, it is unlikely the MLM will dispute any chargebacks as they do not want to lose their merchant.  With that said, and coming from a business where I sold recurring subscriptions to bullshit diet pills, chargebacks are part of the business.  The margins are so high, you really don't give a shit about them.  You just refund and move on.  This MLM is pretty big so I suspect they have multiple merchants and load balance all transactions that go through.But that's what makes this method so great.  This MLM doesn't see chargebacks as fraudulent.  They see chargebacks as expected at some point.  Now as far as the consumer side, you won't be carding huge amounts.  Quite the opposite.  Being in the business before, and knowing the amounts being charged, I would put the chargeback rate at <5%.  It's really just not a method that will expire any time soon.I will come back to this thread as the weeks pass by and I scale the method.  As advised in the tutoring, you need to grow it naturally and gradually and Bongos goes through what he did with no flags.  This is easily scalable to 3-4k a week and we are talking about less than 50 cards a week.  Not only that, you are making more than the card charge because the MLM pays on FUTURE billing.  I like this because I'm not even fucking the card owner, I'm fucking over the bullshit pyramid scams.  I find that a noble cause.Finally, a review on Bongos.  Very easy to deal with.  Gave me the tutoring and then answered the many follow up questions I had.  And he will stick around as I go through the process to answer anything that may come up.I know I am pretty new but for what it's worth, I give this my recommendation if you want to make real money.  I'll be back to update as this progresses.;Z0l4f wrote:=====MY REVIEW=====Bongos was one of my first customers for my Starbucks method, and we have begun working together on providing bulk to the community. In return for including him in this, he offered this method to me as a vouch and to leave an honest review. My opinions on this are 100% my own, and are not influenced by any work with Bongos that I am currently doing. The Method: Use a long standing and popular MLM network, with terrible chargeback policies, to ensure a large and consistent income. Difficulty: 7/10 Time consuming at first, and requires meticulous attention to detail and patience. If you want to go balls to the wall and make a billion dollars in a day, you are going to burn yourself, and everyone else with this method. This is why tutoring from Bongos is extremely important. Price: 10/10 Justified. 2.5 stacks now. 20 stacks in 60 days. You cannot beat those returns. Also it will require you to invest some money so that you actually have a stake to not leak, or ruin your cashout. Profit: 10/10 Astronomical. All you have to do is work a few days a week, for a few hours at a time, and cash cash cash. I plan on being extremely careful and only aiming at 1k-2k a week, that's all I need Saturation Risk: 5/10 If there is a massive influx of people getting their sales networks and upstreams live, you will bet they will up their security. Remember what happened with Amway. Grammar/Readability 10/10. Pros:  - Staright forward and consistent money.  - Crazy profit margins.  - Seedy company that is built on ripping people off. Their chargeback policy is basically in the fraudster's favor. Your marks will be unable to cancel, and the banks will eat the money. Cons: - Setup will be tedious. I mean that mildly, though. If you don't have time to slowly and securely set up your cashout environment, you should hold off on the purchase.  - Not really a con, but will require good cards, and a fullz for your bank drop.  - Will take 4-6 weeks for ROI. It SHOULD actually. If you try to make your money back in 3 days, you will fail. Make sure you have enough time to set this up intelligently. This is truly the closest thing you can get to replacing your day job.  - Not for beginners, but, with Bongos tutoring, anyone who is serious about making money needs this in their arsenal. CONCLUSION: If you have the time and willingness to slowly build up to making upwards of 20k a month, then this is for you. Also with Bongos here to guide you, you will succeed. If you are impatient, unwilling to adapt, or looking to get rich immediately, do yourself and the rest of us a favor and stay away."

Please be sure to contact me before placing your order.","AlfonseSimone wrote:OK guys.  This is my first ever review.First, I would like to echo what cratz had said in his detailed reviewed.  As described in the OP, this is something you cannot go gangbusters on from day 1 or risk being flagged.  So with that said, I cannot give a review on my expected gains 4 weeks from now.  But as it is all explained to me, and from my experience in the continuity billing business (on the legimate side), this has real gains to be realized.Let me expand on what Yas and Alpha had said earlier before I begin.  It may say on the MLM site no chargebacks allowed.  But much like any vendor on EVO can put in their terms whatever they want (FE early, etc), that doesn't make it ""legal.""  My view is that the MLM puts that on the site as a scare tactic but the fact is any reputable merchant will side with the bank and consumer on a digital no signature purchase.  Further, it is unlikely the MLM will dispute any chargebacks as they do not want to lose their merchant.  With that said, and coming from a business where I sold recurring subscriptions to bullshit diet pills, chargebacks are part of the business.  The margins are so high, you really don't give a shit about them.  You just refund and move on.  This MLM is pretty big so I suspect they have multiple merchants and load balance all transactions that go through.But that's what makes this method so great.  This MLM doesn't see chargebacks as fraudulent.  They see chargebacks as expected at some point.  Now as far as the consumer side, you won't be carding huge amounts.  Quite the opposite.  Being in the business before, and knowing the amounts being charged, I would put the chargeback rate at <5%.  It's really just not a method that will expire any time soon.I will come back to this thread as the weeks pass by and I scale the method.  As advised in the tutoring, you need to grow it naturally and gradually and Bongos goes through what he did with no flags.  This is easily scalable to 3-4k a week and we are talking about less than 50 cards a week.  Not only that, you are making more than the card charge because the MLM pays on FUTURE billing.  I like this because I'm not even fucking the card owner, I'm fucking over the bullshit pyramid scams.  I find that a noble cause.Finally, a review on Bongos.  Very easy to deal with.  Gave me the tutoring and then answered the many follow up questions I had.  And he will stick around as I go through the process to answer anything that may come up.I know I am pretty new but for what it's worth, I give this my recommendation if you want to make real money.  I'll be back to update as this progresses."

Months of planning, tweaking but it is finally ready for the public. My previous customers can vouch for my guides effectiveness, adertipnip my most successful customer made thousands on my very and capital one guide as my feedback can attest. I will teach you how to open, access and receive accounts from various prepaid & high street banks. In order of their difficulty and speed of opening. With the accounts you opened it is virtually limitless, create, verify and maintain paypal accounts. Cashout stripe, get loans, overdrafts plus anything your thieving little heart desires. Unlike my other guides, we are not targeting one company so the chances of burning are slim to none so copies will not be limited. But that might change if anything happens. After purchasing you are guaranteed support from me indefinitely, even if Evo shuts down next month. All my customers will be entitled to future banks whenever I add a new bank or provider to the method. A few requirements:1. Drop required for one bank (there are others that don`t require a drop and pretty much online)2. An optional investment of 60-100, you will be able to get your money pretty much instantly.3.

Online bank account (owned by a well known hightstreet bank) with online access, (again no card needed for activation). This method is abit more long winded than using one of the accounts mentioned above, but then the account you get is of alot higher quality than a prepaid. I've not had a chance to set this up yet so will update in the next few days when I do. I don't doubt that it works though, a very clever method that you can tell has had alot of time and thought put into.Highstreet bank accounts with card- If anyone bought the previous guide you will know this method, the difference being though that, where there was only one online bank mentioned before, in this guide you are given 3 banks to play with (all well known banks with highstreet presence). For everyone else reading though this is a very clever method on applying for and receiving credit cards straight to your drop. I've personally used (and still using) this method and can vouch that it works 100% and won't be saturated anytime soonSo all in all, a well written and detailed guide that gives you all the tools needed to obtain as many bank accounts as needed, along with credit cards aswell. You're also shown how to gather data for the accounts, which you can then use for other things aswell, just got to use your imagination;) A couple of spelling mistakes here or there, not something that would bother me, but I have read on a few threads before people getting irate about such things so thought I'd mention it. Aside from that though, gets my vouch all day long. If you know what to do with the accounts and information, there's alot of money that can be made with this guide. Don't just take from it what's put in front of you, there's plenty of other ways you can work with the info and turn it to other scams.

I do not have any criteria for who can buy this and who can't. The guide is comprehensive. I will not give out vouch copies, as it does not have to be evaluated, it has already been by anyone who has bought my Amex accounts, as this is the same method I used to create them. I will sell out my stock and stop vending these. There is a saturation of vendors who will offer this because my method has become discovered. Now I will allow all of you to know how to make your own bank drops. Why Sell It? Vendors on here are starting to sell these, soon they will become saturated and limit Paypal accounts. Instead of paying a lot more, why not take advantage of them still being alive and RAPE the method while you still can. I include huge amount of detail and explain everything. This guide covers more than bank accounts, it covers staying safe online in general.  What Does It Cover? Here are the chapters: -    [ 1.0 ] Fullz and What You Need! â-    [ 1.1 ] Staying Safe â-    [ 1.2 ] IP Address Control & Accessing Amex â-    [ 1.3 ] Preparation & Fullz: BASIC, INTERMEDIATE and PROFFESIONAL â-    [ 1.4 ] Passing the Background Checks â-    [ 1.5 ] Making the Most of One Account â-    [ 1.6 ] Using these as Middleman Accounts â More than just creation, I go through my personal method of using these to maximize efficient cashout with Paypal and other deposits.  Why Should I Buy It? The guide is written by me, and includes all necessary knowledge to open these accounts yourself. The price of this guide the price of around two of these accounts from Trippyy (at the moment $60/ea), so if you buy this, you can make yourself unlimited numbers of these accounts, whilst you'd only buy two from another vendor on here, so it saves money in the long term. The guide can be understood by a member who registered yesterday , â´ New users can understand it, and have much to gain, particularly from the 'Staying Safe' chapter. Price Breakdown Changed Policies: $75 Here:

The only small complaint I have is that the fullz I was provided with did not contain MMN, but otherwise were of very very high quality, seems odd that it was missing. But under the line, this method is a gold mine if you know how to use it. Do not buy this guide if you don't know how to source money and use it, get alpha's or moka's guides first and use this as a supplement I'd suggest. Very recommended for the intermediate user, grab it before it burns.",""

Are you tired of your Stripe accounts getting limited or having to wait for 7 days to get your funds? Wait no more!  This guide will show you how you can turn an initial investment of 300-400$ (including this guide) into a highly profitable operation. (See the end of this post for a detailed breakdown of the numbers)  Work is required but the method is simple and it is easy to do for intermediate carders and even newcomers will be able to master it if they put in some work. Suggestions for possible bank drops can be found at the end of this post.  Features Approx. Profits per Setup Week 1: 1500$Week 2: 2500$  REQUIREMENTS US Bank Drop (no prepaid / ACH enabled)Standard carding setupUS CVV and or DUMPSUS Drop Address (optional)  Advantages over other payment gateways Faster turnaround from Merchant Account to Bank account (<2days)No external shop necessarySwiping of DUMPS possible  Topics covered in the guide Setting up your laptop/deviceSetting up your account/storeFunding the accountCashing out the acocuntAccount management and strategyData acquisition and managementUseful links and ressources  Vouched by mountainhigh9NancyBotwin  XMAS Price:100$   If you have any questions please let me know.

After your account burns you rinse and repeat. You can scale the operation up as much as you like. Example: BASIC Costs: Setup (150$), 60-80 CC for the two weeks (300-400$) = 500$ Income: Week 1 (1500$) + Week 2 (2500$) = 4.000$ ADVANCED Costs: Setup (150$), 60-80 CC for the two weeks (300-400$) x 5 = 2.500$ Income: Profit: 4000$ (for two weeks) x 5 = 20.000$ INITIAL COSTS AND RETURN OF INVESTMENT Costs:   My Guide (100$) +Bankdrop (100$)+30 CC for first week (150$)=350$ Profit first week: 50$ avg. per CC = 1500$ ROI: 2-3 days (after you started charging the first cards) Since your money is in a US bank drop you can simply buy BTC with it or get a debit card if you prefer CASH. Enjoy your money, coke and bitches    Suitable Bankdrops All bank accounts in the following list are by vouched sellers and will work with this method. If you are in the US and have access to a drop this is the best option. Just do some experimenting and try out different banks. Having a burner phone to call the banks and using HQ fullz details make your life easier. There are many banks that do not require for you to come into a branch to make an initial deposit or something of the like so this is not impossible at all. Please note that I am not from the US so don't ask me about any details just do some research and you should have succees. If note move on to the next option which is buying a BoA bank drop.

Like i already mentioned experienced, ""gateway cashout"" users will have a 99% chance, of already knowing this site, when i say ""experienced"" i do not mean just a Stripe user i am talking about people that have used a handful of payment gateways. The MethodLike i mentioned above the method does WORK but cashout`s can vary, having been experienced with this gateway, i can tell you sometimes you will hit BIG sometimes you will hit small, but all in all the vendor is selling a product that works.;nancybotwin wrote:I received a vouch copy several weeks ago, but because of health reasons, I've been off of the forums for some time. On the up side, Iâve had a lot of time to test this method. Here is my review as promised.Stratton Oakmont's Cashout 3.0 is ten pages of very detailed instructions on how to turn inexpensive CVVs into Cash/BTC pretty easily. Those of you familiar with Stripe or any of Mokaâs offerings will already know of the payment processor used. I believe ânoobsâ to payment gateways/processors will get the most out of this. In order for this method to work, you will need the following:US Bank Drop. Brick and mortar bank is suggested, however, I used Ally bank just fine.Standard carding setup (VPN/RDP/SOCKS ETC)US CVV and or DUMPS (I did not use dumps)Fullz Android Emulator (free download)Strattonâs guide is a quick read and you can get started right away. The only thing you will have to wait for is for your bank account to receive test deposit/withdrawal to verify the account (2 days or so) then away you go!There really isnât much to say here without giving away a lot of the info in the guide. Youâre basically just charging cards all day long. Itâs easy and very profitable. No rocket science here And unlike Stripe, this processor doesnât have waiting periods. Charge cards on Monday, money is in your account on Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday. Cashout to Coinbase or like me, cashout to a Paypal account if youâve got one attached to your bank drop (because Coinbase can be a bitch sometimes).Start off small and you can work your way up to $500 a day easily. When you burn your account, get another one and keep going. With a little bit of work youâll make a very nice income.Pros: Easy method, Fast Cashouts, Excellent list of resources included, Vendor seems nice and helpful.Cons: Price. $200 is a lot for this guide honestly because it only covers one processor. I would rather see a $75-$95 dollar price tag.Definitely recommended with a price adjustment  Nancy B."

Anyone physically present in America should be able to open a bank drop for less than 100$ though. Most banks will let you open an account online so basically all you need is fullz, scans and a mail drop. In case you have a fake ID you can even open the account instore which has the advantage of it being activated straight away. It has the disadvantage of having to be in the bank in person and the cost of a physical ID though. I'm not the huge expert with US banks but I'm sure people that live there can figure something out.  Also as I mentioned before there are providers that offer bank drops for a 50% cut.

On the up side, Iâve had a lot of time to test this method. Here is my review as promised. Stratton Oakmont's Cashout 3.0 is ten pages of very detailed instructions on how to turn inexpensive CVVs into Cash/BTC pretty easily. Those of you familiar with Stripe or any of Mokaâs offerings will already know of the payment processor used. I believe ânoobsâ to payment gateways/processors will get the most out of this. In order for this method to work, you will need the following: US Bank Drop. Brick and mortar bank is suggested, however, I used Ally bank just fine.Standard carding setup (VPN/RDP/SOCKS ETC)US CVV and or DUMPS (I did not use dumps)Fullz Android Emulator (free download) Strattonâs guide is a quick read and you can get started right away. The only thing you will have to wait for is for your bank account to receive test deposit/withdrawal to verify the account (2 days or so) then away you go! There really isnât much to say here without giving away a lot of the info in the guide. Youâre basically just charging cards all day long. Itâs easy and very profitable. No rocket science here And unlike Stripe, this processor doesnât have waiting periods. Charge cards on Monday, money is in your account on Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday. Cashout to Coinbase or like me, cashout to a Paypal account if youâve got one attached to your bank drop (because Coinbase can be a bitch sometimes). Start off small and you can work your way up to $500 a day easily. When you burn your account, get another one and keep going. With a little bit of work youâll make a very nice income.  Pros: Easy method, Fast Cashouts, Excellent list of resources included, Vendor seems nice and helpful. Cons: Price. $200 is a lot for this guide honestly because it only covers one processor. I would rather see a $75-$95 dollar price tag. Definitely recommended with a price adjustment   Nancy B.",""

Example: BASIC Costs: Setup (150$), 60-80 CC for the two weeks (300-400$) = 500$ Income: Week 1 (1500$) + Week 2 (2500$) = 4.000$ ADVANCED Costs: Setup (150$), 60-80 CC for the two weeks (300-400$) x 5 = 2.500$ Income: Profit: 4000$ (for two weeks) x 5 = 20.000$ INITIAL COSTS AND RETURN OF INVESTMENT Costs:   My Guide (100$) +Bankdrop (100$)+30 CC for first week (150$)=350$ Profit first week: 50$ avg. per CC = 1500$ ROI: 2-3 days (after you started charging the first cards) Since your money is in a US bank drop you can simply buy BTC with it or get a debit card if you prefer CASH. Enjoy your money, coke and bitches    Suitable Bankdrops All bank accounts in the following list are by vouched sellers and will work with this method. The successful bank account vendor Ozzyz is currently selling a guide on how to create an American Express bank drop for only 75$. This will cut your costs considerably and enable you to make much more profit.

Like i already mentioned experienced, ""gateway cashout"" users will have a 99% chance, of already knowing this site, when i say ""experienced"" i do not mean just a Stripe user i am talking about people that have used a handful of payment gateways. The MethodLike i mentioned above the method does WORK but cashout`s can vary, having been experienced with this gateway, i can tell you sometimes you will hit BIG sometimes you will hit small, but all in all the vendor is selling a product that works.;nancybotwin wrote:I received a vouch copy several weeks ago, but because of health reasons, I've been off of the forums for some time. On the up side, Iâve had a lot of time to test this method. Here is my review as promised.Stratton Oakmont's Cashout 3.0 is ten pages of very detailed instructions on how to turn inexpensive CVVs into Cash/BTC pretty easily. Those of you familiar with Stripe or any of Mokaâs offerings will already know of the payment processor used. I believe ânoobsâ to payment gateways/processors will get the most out of this. In order for this method to work, you will need the following:US Bank Drop. Brick and mortar bank is suggested, however, I used Ally bank just fine.Standard carding setup (VPN/RDP/SOCKS ETC)US CVV and or DUMPS (I did not use dumps)Fullz Android Emulator (free download)Strattonâs guide is a quick read and you can get started right away. The only thing you will have to wait for is for your bank account to receive test deposit/withdrawal to verify the account (2 days or so) then away you go!There really isnât much to say here without giving away a lot of the info in the guide. Youâre basically just charging cards all day long. Itâs easy and very profitable. No rocket science here And unlike Stripe, this processor doesnât have waiting periods. Charge cards on Monday, money is in your account on Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday. Cashout to Coinbase or like me, cashout to a Paypal account if youâve got one attached to your bank drop (because Coinbase can be a bitch sometimes).Start off small and you can work your way up to $500 a day easily. When you burn your account, get another one and keep going. With a little bit of work youâll make a very nice income.Pros: Easy method, Fast Cashouts, Excellent list of resources included, Vendor seems nice and helpful.Cons: Price. $200 is a lot for this guide honestly because it only covers one processor. I would rather see a $75-$95 dollar price tag.Definitely recommended with a price adjustment  Nancy B."

Bonus with this guide  ***Disclaimer: There will be no support for the bonus***  I have seen that many people here sell CC>BTC ""guides"" which are essentially just links to sites that allow the purchase of BTC with CC. That is why I have decided to include a list of 4 websites that allow you to buy BTC with a CC that have hard but beatable security. Each of the links will come with a brief description about the features of the website, the verification process and security features.  Please note that this is only a bonus and has nothing to do with the main method of the guide. It is just a way to give back to my customers. Everyone that bough this method or will buy the method in the future is eligible for this bonus. It will available in 24h.

The requirements for the method can be found in the OP. There is basically no difference between non US users and US users. You will need a US bank drop either way. The only thing more easy as a US user is to receive a debit card for a bank drop. There are many ways to cash out a US bank account apart from using it's debit card. You can buy BTC or send the money to a bank drop in your country (prepaids might be possible) .

Even though i got given a vouch copy, and i took a while to reply Stratton didn't get full of himself like most vendors but messaged me letting me know it's fine these things happen, which understandably they do. Stratton sent me his guide, and it was a processor i am somewhat familiar with but i've not done it in the way he shows... It's extremely easy...EXTREMELY. I setup my first setup in 10 minutes, if that and quite honestly i think a 11 year old these days could get it going aswell... I run these setups on my surface pro 3 so it's nice and simple. I use bank drops in the same name as my account information from BoA so the accounts get confirmed straight away and can put payments through in the first 5 minutes, I made $8500 on these on 4 setups, i haven't had time to continue as admittedly coinbase has started canceling like every one of my bitcoin orders, and being UK based it's nigh on impossible to cash out EASILY most other ways.

I would recommend to get a bank drop first (please make sure that it supports in and outgoing ACH transfers). After you have that you should not have any problems. You should also be aware that a good security setup and basic carding skills are a prerequisite to be able to use this method effectively. Please let me know if you have any more questions.

I make close to $500 per day, and sometimes even more, just by using these methods.  I am also a sports handicapper, so that provides another income for me.  The first 5 people to order this guide will get 1 month of free sports picks from me.  The sports picks along with these methods can easily earn you more than $500 per day. This isn't just another bad guide on how to use some method that will get shut down quickly, or is already shut down.  This guide is over 20 pages long, and goes into detail about everything you need to know to start making money NOW. The bookies online literally have an unlimited amount of money, and you and I taking $500/day from themwill not even come close to making a dent in their bank accounts.  However, in this guide, I show you how to scale this method up to make HUGE money. The first 2 copies will be 0.1 BTC.  The price will then raise to 0.2 BTC. Contact me if you have any questions. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/87880",""

"Evolution Forums","drwho88888","48214","2015-02-28T17:51:51","Re: LEGALLY Steal Money From The Bookies: $500/Day","Guides Vendors","Not exactly true. Bookies have lots of bonuses everyday besides the initial deposit bonus. The problem with doing anything with bookies is that once they get wind of what you're doing they limit you to very small amounts.You can also bonus bag with their casinos by playing both blackjack and poker. And then you can arb by laying off on Betfair too. Loads of those each day but you will get limited quite quickly. Overall you can make a modest amount in profit. Totally legally. Then there is the Lucky15 which can return a healthy profit if you have an organised team to place the bets for you in shops. That's your biggest overhead and will make a big dent in your profit margin. I know someone who turns over Â£10m a year to make Â£60K profit but you have to know what your doing and it's a full time job. And bookies (particularly Betfred) are reducing the bonuses every year which the method relies on. But its still modestly profitable if you've got the time and resources.","NotSuspicious wrote:drwho88888 wrote:This is not really worth paying for. Its simply bonus bagging. Google it. Don't get me wrong, bonus bagging does work but you dont need to pay for a guide to learn how to use it.With bonus bagging you can only do it once per account, so how is it legal? You will have to create accounts not in your name."

Haven't tried out the method but I don't see why it shouldn't work, however to see profit it is not nearly as simple as the guide makes it to be. If you have zero experience making bets online than you might struggle at first as there are lots of things I would consider important that are not covered in the guide or just touched upon but not very in depth, I won't give examples as I don't want to give anything about the guide away. But if you do have experience using online sports books than I would say it is well worth it as it is very cheap to buy.  Another point, there is absolutely no way to make this work legally if you are located in the US (and many other countries actually). However, I don't see that being a big deterrent as everyone reading this is currently using an illegal website.",""

I can honestly say that it works, this method will never saturate or get burned. The key thing is that you actually have toget up, and do something.  Knowledge is power, and that knowledge can come from a 30 page manual or a 1 sentence txt-file.

I can honestly say that it works, this method will never saturate or get burned. The key thing is that you actually have toget up, and do something.  Knowledge is power, and that knowledge can come from a 30 page manual or a 1 sentence txt-file.

EVEN if the drugs are found by the police, they can NEVER prove that you have ordered them. TOR is still a safe place. Dont worry, they can not arrest you because of this.  If I want I could buy 1 KG drugs and send to your house right? Or to my neighbor, to my ""enemies"", whatever. No one can ever proove that the person who sent you drugs was yourself. In worst case: deny that you have ever bought something form the DarkNet. No one can prove the opposite.  Chill out dude! Relax. Take this shit out of your mind. And have a nice week.

I would be prepared to give a vouch copy to a member of staff or a trusted member to look over and review. EDIT: You are safe to use your own house address and details to do refunds on Amazon or any site, If you follow the guide there is no comebacks are its not illegal in Amazon's eyes they are just fixing something that is wrong and case is closed, Nobody ever looks at it again. If you have any questions at all, Please feel free to ask me. Grandeur

Style of Writing  Well written, speaks in perfect English and breaks everything down by the steps. I've had a few guides in the past where the author clearly has no grasp of the english language and writes like a retard but this one is done well. Goes as two documents don't understand why, but other than that can't fault it. 5/5  Easability of Use and Practicality Like I said before this is broken down into steps, and offers transcripts incase your not sure of how to respond in a situation. Puts you to ease and instills a sense of confidence in you while you processing your own refund. Has a tips and tricks section which is really really helpful offering alternative options on how to improve success on repeat orders.  5/5   Customer Service Haven't contacted him personally yet, because I have yet to meet with a problem. Will update as I go along.  UPDATE: I thought his guide was damn good, but his customer service is even better. He responds rapidly, is on quite often, helps out to no end and breaks things down in laymans terms. Honestly can't say a bad word about him through my own personal experience.  5/5    Overall  Fantastic informative guide which does what it says. I recommend more transcripts so people know how to react in different situations, but other than that its a damn good guide. Perfect for beginners and intermediates, bit expensive, but you'll make your money back in no time.  5/5

Maybe you could help since you are still selling this guide Grandeur. Maybe you could detail the process needed to get multiple orders through on amazon?

Sometimes Prepaid reloads work sometimes they don't. Seems to have something to do with account history and order total.  Shit is really annoying because I bought the guide hoping to do multiple refunds but can't seem to get an order through on anything that would be worth reselling without using a friends highly established account (order history/not brand new) usually with their personal bank debit card.

Maybe you could detail the process needed to get multiple orders through on amazon?VPN + SOCKS + MAC CHANGE + NEW ACCOUNT DETAILS + GIFTCARD/RELOADABLE/ACCOUNTNOW   Has already been tried, only thing I can think of is the computer still somehow being footprinted because I've tried everything short of placing an order on a new computer/new account. Sometimes Prepaid reloads work sometimes they don't. Seems to have something to do with account history and order total.  Shit is really annoying because I bought the guide hoping to do multiple refunds but can't seem to get an order through on anything that would be worth reselling without using a friends highly established account (order history/not brand new) usually with their personal bank debit card.

This method is fresh as it can be, and as simple as it can be. There is no easier way of making money currently then with this one. You can transfer up to $4000 to $5000 (max) per hacked account at a time, after which it takes 2-3 working days for the money to arrive in your drop. This method can be done multiple times a day EASY and you can redo it until your USA hacked bankaccount(s) gets burned. This means you will see a profit already after your first transfer. What do you need:- VPN + Socks5- Hacked USA bankaccounts, not everyone of them will work (explained in the guide how to get them cheap 10$-25$ a piece) - Bankdrop either in the UK or EU.- Some CVVs to do some carding (not much knowledge needed)- Sometimes they will ask you for photoid. So you will need to buy one off from one of the vendors. What do you get from this guide:- Cashing out your accounts for 4 to 5k per transfer- ROI to be seen in just a few days. Especially if you start in the beginning of the week.- A method that is as easy and simple as it gets.- ongoing support from me on either jabb3r/icq The guide explains everything from A-Z, step by step. It's the same method as the one anonpsychosis is currently selling for 5k. And NO, I did not steal his method or w/e. Has already been reviewed by walker. Will update when he received his money. I will only sell 6 copies of this guide, due to possible saturation, and maximizing buyers ROI. 3 for $1750 and 3 for $2000. So get it while you can.

The developers shut it down when they learned that it had been compromised (for reasons actually unknown specifically to me) http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/  for your proof. I recommend coughing up $90 for symantec encryption, I use it and it works quite beautifully. If you try to find symantec encryption torrent I'm going to figuratively literally murder you. So basically all you slowly educated mules have to unencrypt and then REencrypt your drives. Have fun with that! (sounds dangerous, and good luck) Stay Safe!   P.S. Side note, if you've read the Sticky ""Not all PGP's are the same"" he mentions that because symantec is a private, american company, he doesn't trust or use their PGP (citing a bad experience) Any other encrypt software commendations are welcome.

This is not a new subject on the carding boards but what you have seen is outdated and not working with current anti-fraud detection.This is the most complete and in-depth poker guide you will find ANYWHERE and with this guide and basic poker knowledge you can make a lot of money. The guide will cover everything of carding online poker sites:-Software requirements before starting-How to prepare the carded and cashout accounts-Which country cards to use and which to avoid-How to get around the need of CC scans with my VCC method-How to play with both accounts without getting detected, really in depth with a WEEK-schedule how to play on which days with which style on the cashout and carded account.-Also instructions how to play on table with an overview of every position made in paint.-How to monetize the cashout account (several options) Reviews from TCF (http://nifgk5szbodg7qbo.onion/viewtopic.php?f=98&t=3573):''While poker cashout isn't a new subject and may be familiar to some of you, this guide does a great job of laying out pretty much everything. It's well-written and explains the details you need; it goes pretty in depth so that even a complete newbie can do it (assuming you know how to work a SOCKS5, duh). The included schedules are a pretty nice touch. Looks like the guy knows what he is doing and is willing to share that.'' - Themostseekrit (MOD of TCF) Have bought this guide a week ago and it is really good information! It guides you trough every step of the chipdumping process and his weekly schedule is really good, I have used it the past week and have made some really good money (almost 1k I think) The only ''bad'' thing is that you have to invest time playing, it is not some 3 click cashout method but still the profits and guide are REALLY good.-Camill After reading through the guide thoroughly and checking through every step, it's really quite solid.-Fireface

"Evolution Forums","Yasuo","13656","2014-06-17T05:46:38","[!WARNING!] *READ THIS! Important Guide* [!WARNING!]","Guides Vendors","1. SETTING UP TORBy default, TOR is configured to use any available nodes/relays once you are connected to the network. There are millions of relays/nodes that are available in the deepweb, however, it is also LE's way of catching up. When you land in one of their nodes/relays, there's a huge chance that your activity is logged. Also, some people say that once you enter one of their relays, it will be web from there. Also, by default, TOR changes relays/nodes every <10 minutes. So if you land on one of LE's nodes, there's a chance that your next node will be from them. So, me and a couple of people have discussed this here in Evolution.CLICK HERE TO READ THE DISCUSSION Our point was, to land on nodes that are considered 'safe' and our choices were offshore countries. So, to do this, go to this directory:Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor and open your torcc file with Notepad and copy paste the following: To explain the configuration, the chosen ExitNodes were by, cn, and ru. And to avoid the 'high-risk' nodes, we have to use the ExcludeExitNodes to strictly avoid the high-risk nodes. â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬â¬ SECURITY/ANONYMITY HOST REQUIREMENTS Linux OSVPNVirtual Machine  SETTING UP YOUR HOST SYSTEMI am not a security expert and my current setup was per Kimble's recommendation. The #1 rule in setting up a Host System is to NEVER EVER USE WINDOWS. I believe the reason most people say that is because of the security flaw that Windows has and since it's the biggest platform of operating system, it's the easiest to penetrate. For your OS, I suggest using Debian just because that what Kimble recommended. It's really easy to navigate as it looks like Apple. Your Mozilla Firefox is Iceweasel and setting up everything else is easy. For example:user: woman make me a sandwichwoman: *ignores*user: sudo woman make me a sandwichwoman: coming right up Debian, or Linux in general, is such a pain in the ass to deal with if you're new. However, it's worth all your time to learn it so that you can build a powerful setup.  There are a couple of architectures in it. I'm using x64 because that's what's compatible for my laptop. If your current burner doesn't have SSD, I suggest you download DBAN and use that on your laptop. It completely erases all files from the hard drive. Alright. Right now, let's assume that your burner was already DBANed and you have finally installed Debian. I would suggest working on your VPN first. This is a good list of which VPN you should choose and which VPN you should avoid: Now that we have our VPN installed, let's connect to that first before we proceed. Next step should be setting up TrueCrypt 7.1a. Only download it from the link below: Posted by: arcana You can follow this link on setting up your containers/volume: But make sure you follow arcana's settings: You should understand that when you make a volume in TrueCrypt, there's the Standard and the Hidden. But when mounting you volume, you will be only asked for 1 password. Depending on what password you put will either mount the Standard or the Hidden Volume. On the Standard volume, this is the place where we put our decoy files. Decoy files could be fake bank logins, your credit card credentials, something you consider 'valuable'. This should be fake files. You can also put porn here. On the Hidden Volume, our Virtual Machine will be there. Also include the .ISO of the OS your using and the Virtual Machine files. Do not put any sensitive files on your Hidden Partition. Once everything is done, just go ahead and get Bleachbit. This is the CCleaner for Linux distros. We Bleachbit our system everytime we're done using it. SETTING UP YOUR GUEST SYSTEM GUEST REQUIREMENTS TAILS/Whonix/WindowsVPNVIP72MAC Changer [Optional]Hard Drive Serial # Changer [Optional] You can choose any Linux Distro or Windows for your Guest OS. Here's a good tutorial for setting up Whonix and Tails: Next, get another VPN from the list I have given above. Make sure you choose ones that don't leak DNS. Also, make sure the one you get accepts Bitcoin as you want to be as anonymous as possible. After setting up our VPN, we use it, and then download TOR. You should know how and where to download TOR since you're able to read this. After installing TOR, we should get VIP72 which is our SOCKS5 provider: When surfing the clearnet with Firefox, make sure to read this really good guide on how to secure Firefox: After that, just make sure you download CCleaner to clean cookies, temporary files, and etc: That's about it. And for a final note, after using your Virtual Machine, make sure you run CCleaner first. I also use Bleachbit on my Guest as well because there are some files that Bleachbit cleans but CCleaner can't. After cleaning the guest OS, shut down your VM, and then remove your VM on the list on VirtualBox. Make sure you press Remove Only. After that, unmount your drive from TrueCrypt, because if you shut down without unmounting, you'll have problems loading up your volume on your next use. SETTING UP YOUR PROPER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMJust follow this link by mountainhigh9 everything you need to setup a good communication system is in there. If you follow everything, you should have a decent burner laptop. There's a better setup than this that is posted in TCF - Tor Carding Forums. But this should be good enough. HOW TO NOT GET RIPPED OFF ON GUIDES/METHODS There has been a massive influx of guides for sale here in Evolution Market right now. Only a few are selling guides that are worth the money as the majority are either: Selling public methods.Selling private methods but rewording it themselves and calling it there own.Selling leaked methods. Before you purchase any guides or methods, I RECOMMEND that you follow the steps below: Also, if you ever encounter a guide regarding PPD/CPA, never ever entertain that idea unless there's blackhat method involved that could maximize your earnings abnormally. However, if it's the regular PPD/CPA bullshit, you might as well invest your money over CPAElites or Blackhatworld as they have really good support for that to help you all the way. REMEMBER: Google is your friend. Sometimes a little search can save you as much as $999 or more. There's a lot of valuable information available for free. Knowledge is power. Be street wise. If you can save money by doing a bit of search, then do that. Try to search before buying, because sometimes, the things you need are within your reach if you just SEARCH! PRODUCTS SECTION I'm pretty sure you have come across people selling services like, Twitter followers, unlimit Paypal, documents, and what not. A lot of users here are just outsourcing or reselling the works of other to gain a bit of profit. Alright, applying the security and anonymity we use in Leak.sx, go ahead and register in www.blackhatworld.com. Check out their Marketplace and you'll be able to find what you need there.

Use the Whirlpool hash algorithm. (SHA-512 is a very close 2nd place here. It's debatable. I'm leaning towards Whirlpool because SHA-512 is already having a successor developed because of fears that it is based on an older SHA-1 that has been compromised.) Most important is to use a very strong password. 20 to 30+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols. Use Microsoft's online password checker for a strength test. You can also use keyfiles to further secure your password.You should use the AES-Twofish-Serpent over the Serpent-Twofish-AES because you want the outermost encryption (AES will be the first layer they need to break) to be the most standard in the industry. That one is the most tried and true and the most tested of all of them. Plus, if someone assumes a file is encrypted with AES, there's no way of seeing that is is then encrypted with Twofish... so they do all this work to break the AES, only to find that Twofish stands in their way now. And then again after Twofish they run into Serpent, which is the biggest beast of them all (even though it is less used / tested than AES, it still has a much higher security margin than AES)If you do use Keyfiles, have TrueCrypt create 3 keyfiles for you. Create one keyfile for each hash algorithm they provide. You might also add some .jpg's and some .mp3 files as well. You should make sure to make each keyfile read-only.;bleachbit.sourceforge.net/;http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/06/13/simple-whonix-installation-tutorial/;http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/06/14/simple-tails-installation/;www.vip72.org;http://www.deepdotweb.com/security-tutorials/securing-firefox/;https://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER;http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=16514;1. Go to clearnet with your VPN + SOCKS5.2. Register in Leak.sx. [ Leak.sx is the site where people leak all the paid methods/guides/products/softwares you'll find in most forums like Warrior, Hackforums, and any other sites. ]3. Now, VPN is not enough because they have banned almost all data centers that supports VPN. But if you make a VPN through your VPS, that should be fine. That's why we use SOCKS5 because the IPs in VIP72/Super-Socks aren't blacklisted in that site. Also, if you get banned there, their stupid Admin will post your IP publicly. Remember, the site is infested with LE.4. From there, it's pretty much self-explanatory.5. Remember, if you plan to buy something here in Evolution, make sure you search Leak.sx first because there's a huge chance you'll find some guides here that are freely available there.;Don't meet up with people on here.Don't send money any other way then alt-coin.Don't post pictures or videos even if they do not include physical threats.;- Don't sell your own identity! I've seen a few people almost do this to themselves.- Change your typing patterns while on DW.- Treat everyone as if they are LE.- Use PGP when discussing sensitive information.- Keep your house clean and don't shit where you sleep.;Do not treat everyone as LE or your life will be extremely difficult and you'll not crate much of contacts. Instead be smart what you share.sudo hostnamewill reveal your computer name on which you can be profiled super easily just as with mac address.sudo hostname your_new_namewill change your computer name for that session without restart, I do this for my main host every time I log in, also use firefox portable when visiting clear net sites. Be aware of ""bakons"";> Watch out for members having usernames similar to reputed members here. For example, Kimble (the forum administrator), was once impersonated by another user having a similar username, where the letter 'L' was substituted by the letter 'I'. Also, I noticed a new user with a similar username as 'kalashnikov' here. His username is 'Kalasnikhov'. Be cautious of any PM from such users. > Also, be wary of any PM from Evolution Team or TCF Team asking for a donation. They are most likely to be scams.;- Almost all clearnet carding board's escrow system is fake/bullshit/lie.- Once they take your money as BTC, they immediately change your forum password and you can't access to forums after that.- Scammer admins usually make a good comment to thread instead of you, with your nickname.- When a new user see a scam thread with 30 pages of good feedbacks, he/she never think about scam, and scammed once again.That's their way. Be careful about this.Also. i like reading, and people who like reading/researching. As i always said, private/special guides must be more expensive compared to collectible guides. Think logical about this.Private guides are usually expensive because of avoiding quick saturation chance and giving you exactly your target/targets. Vendor's responsibility and dominance with their method is an important factor.Collectible guides can give you tons of ideas for finding your own way, own ""fraud title"" in your fraud adventures. Vendor's responsibility, customer service and dominance with their method is an important factor for this too. If a vendor selling 10 paypal guides and does not know anything about paypal, this is unacceptable imho.You can always use google as Yasuo's said. Google is always best friend for eveything. Also, i want to give a little trick,- You can search with inurl tag on some upload websites for your spesific searchings.For example ""inurl:anonfiles.com paypal""  may give you some guides free.Some websites are restricted for reading content. You can use, but be careful of possible scams.Be careful vendor's last login dates, situations, make a quick check on feedbacks and also if you have time, read one-by-one comments about his sales on forum before buying anything. This will make you more safe.Evolution and TCF are one of safest places on deepweb but it's still your responsibility when purchasing something. If you read a PM from one member and sent BTC to directly his wallet for a bank transfer, Kimble or Verto can't do anything if you've scammed.Good sales to all vendors, good wishes to all buyers.Regards.;- If the vendor is selling guides for a decent price and he's creating new lists each day, make sure to ask the vendor if the guide is written and tested by him personally. Probably not.- Make sure to google titles of guides/ebooks and see if you can download them for free where the vendors downloaded it too. Some vendors will even copy the exact information from the website/forum they've downloaded from, so try to google some sentences too.;Do not give any personal information/ any info related to your area/ life, friends, habits to your buyers. Yep, they may be bought your amazing service as 5 btc, but this is not proof that they're not LE.Try to keep your conversations in business. Remember, first SR's some members was arrested this kind of leaks.;For fucks sake, people, please don't be blinded with methods/guides that says:[SUPER AWESOME WONDERFUL] $999999/second guide. ONLY 10 COPIES AVAILABLE! EXTREMELY DISCOUNTED! ONLY $201. If they make that amount, then why do they have to share their method and risk saturation? Let's just say the method/guide has no saturation, why would you come here and sell it for $20? When you can just focus on that work and earn a huge amount of money.2. When people say only 10 copies available. This is just another marketing method to make you think that what they are selling is limited and you should get one or you'll miss a deal of a lifetime.3. ALWAYS REMEMBER. If it's too good to be true, it actually is. The real money making methods aren't for sale. They are kept in secret. Because why would you share something that can earn you big money? Because you're generous? Because you want to help people who you don't give a fuck and who also doesn't give a fuck about you here in Evolution?4. Please read the first post. I've been scammed a lot of times and it never felt good. I don't want you guys to experience the same thing. Just read and search. After that, search again until you get the result you want. Most vendors here that sell guides/methods are just using leaked methods/guides and are renaming and rewording it so that they can claim that it's their 100% original work.;CARDING:1. alpha02's guide.DROP:1. ucard's guide.PAYPAL:1. Alphawolf2. wefinance's hands-on tutoring.INSTORING:1. penissmith - he's a bitch but he knows what he's doing.;All kind of ""Bitcoin Private Key"" sales in Deep Web are time waste.If you enjoy importing ""private keys"" in to blockchain.info, then- Go https://brainwallet.github.io/#generator- Enter Passphrase- Create your address and also private key.- Go, blockchain.info- Import that private key and see ""0.00"" and enjoy this.If you lazy for enter a password, here's a wordlist for you. > http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists;1. As a newbie, do not expect to necessary score 5-10k from the first 10 good CCs that you buy. Be prepared to burn the first ones like crazy without going nuts big_smile .Just don't get started if you can't afford basic protection and some minimum investment in CCs (mine was less than 200 and scored 1.2k in 2 weeks without knowing anything about this stuff, doing it just for fun and to see how it works). Being broke at home beats by far being broke in jail...2. Stop asking everyone you meet about cardable sites, howto's, freebies, etc. No one will tell you shit, unless it is for money or expired already. Stupid question: what would you do in their place????? wink3. IMPORTANT: again, from personal experience, the VERY BEST support you'll ever have will always come from the best vendors here. When you buy stuff from them, most of them will give you lots of tips and advice, bonuses, etc. Do not necessary go for the cheapest stuff on the market, but for the most reputed/vouched, as they are so packed with sales and feedbacks for a reason................4. Always keep in mind: this (i.e. carding) is a business, and you should definitely treat it like such, if you want to make a living out of it.;My personal rule: If they talk too much, hype up their product and bump their promo thread 5 times a day, they're a scammer. If you have quality product you don't need to shout, people will do the shouting for you!If a vendor has alot of valid cc's in, you won't mind giving out free cc's in the beginning, vouch copies will never be a problem for a reputable vendor who can actually do what they say they can do! I remember when Kalashnikov first started out he gave me one valid CC as a sample and the rest is history, he is now the most sought after vendor on EVO.If a vendor is reluctant to give a sample to reputable member just don't even give the person the time of day."

If you're more than a small time buyer, you may want to look into an Open VPN or proxy-chaining.  But there are many others in this forum that can help you out in that area, much better than I can.","snaphack77 wrote:Im sorry this is probably going to be very annoying and sound incredibly stupid but i read through that whole guide and didnt understand a single thing.

If you have quality product you don't need to shout, people will do the shouting for you! If a vendor has alot of valid cc's in, you won't mind giving out free cc's in the beginning, vouch copies will never be a problem for a reputable vendor who can actually do what they say they can do! I remember when Kalashnikov first started out he gave me one valid CC as a sample and the rest is history, he is now the most sought after vendor on EVO.

At first I was speaking to Bongos in depth regarding his guide at $5000 for a MLM course which would generate 3-5k$ per week, I was hesitant as this was ALOT of money to invest upfront, then I saw Dietpepsi's/OverstockDOTtor's post and PM'd him, spoke to him in depth on ICQ before purchasing and I've got to say this is an amazing method which I wouldn't of thought of myself. Things to take into consideration; 1, This is NOT a I buy the course for however many $$$ and I'll be a millionaire tomorrow it just won't happen so if your a lazy fuck don't bother.2, you will be making money from BOTH companies even though one is just to check your cards for the second company.3, I would recommend you follow OverstockDOTtor's teachings going all HELL MARY trying to make $10,000 in your first week is NOT going to work.4, with the first company there is a chance if your willing to do the 2 extra steps (which is not hard AT ALL) to make ALOT more $$$ OverstockDOTtor quotes 600$/week I would say if you go the extra mile and do the extra steps explained by OverstockDOTtor you could make around $1-3k from this company on top of the $1-3k which is doable with the second company.5, OverstockDOTtor's teachings are IDIOT PROOF if you follow them to a T you can't go wrong!!! In all honesty, I didn't pay full whack for the tutoring but I would do in a heart beat, it's a great session and you will learn loads. OverstockDOTtor's teaching methods are awesome too, you can have a laugh and joke around and still get the job done, and he is always serious when needs to be. My ratings for this tutoring session out of 10, OverstockDOTtor after sales guidance: 10/10OverstockDOTtor teachings: 9/10profit margins: 8/10 My overall score would be 9/10.",""

The deposit was supposed to come Thursday but came in just this morning. I wasn't even going hard mostly because I ran out of cc's and I even charged 2 or 3 cc's twice but this is not recommended unless you do a certain thing which he can teach you. This method is INCREDIBLY EASY. Not sure why he is selling it. He's only been doing it a short while himself. $750 is too cheap. 5k should be an introduction price, then 7.5k from there on out, maybe even 10k.

First things first this is my first one of these but obviously my views are my own. I'm Literally JUST starting on the fraud scene. But through dietpepsi's mentoring i understood everything i needed to do pretty much straight away. After every step he asked for and was willing to answer questions. Even my noob questions that werent directly related to the task at hand.We couldnt cover one aspect during the initial set up as we were waiting on an element.. but when i came to that part he was reachable and happy to explain. Since our session hes been available every day if i had any follow up questions  (due to his teaching method though this hasnt happened) The con itself probably isnt new to most people that have been through the fraudsters hoops but the part in the original post about the first company is invaluable. Without giving too much away they explain straight away if your cards are going to be accepted at the second (money maker) company. I got 10 cards off a member here and only 1 worked. The explanations as to why the others didnt was pretty informative, especially for me as im just learning. I haven't cashed out yet (because of the aforementioned cards) but i see no problem with it working.  All in all. Price 10/10 completely reasonable. Id pay more for this. Method 10/10 very quick and easy Guidance 15/10 willing to explain everything in minute detailNoob friendly 10/10 no socks or vpn etc he can even provide Cards+Drop Wonderful experience getting my feet wet in this world and already told Dietpepsi/OverstockDOTtor that any future guides or classes that im in.",""

Airvpn are good operators (surprising given they are Italians) and have an excellent platform and you can buy with BTC.  They are fanatical about the no logs claim and I have experienced this first hand. Essentially how can you produce something that doesn't exist...  Airvpn have a greater variety of server locations but some of them leak dns so you need to watch this.  Mullvad rarely experiences this problem.

I live in a very lowly populated region so our craiglist is pretty sparse in terms of seller's and people with money ... and whatnot. Can anyone make any suggestions on really popular item's that are like $500 (i'd have to buy 2 of them) or $1000 that would be seen by more craiglist user's and sold easiest? On that note, how risky really would it be to get a DD of 2 items (twice, so 4 items) from Amazon and just go turn around and sell them on e-bay? Is there really anyway for Amazon to trace my account with them to my e-bay account and make the connection that the item's i'm attempting to sell on e-bay are item's that 'were not delivered' (aka I stole) from Amazon? Cuz the people that buy off e-bay are just end user's, so as long as it's not an item with like a warranty or registration what really would be the likelihood of them checking the item's serial # against item's Amazon has 'lost in transit (twice)' to me? If there is some real risk I should know about please, i'd really like to just be told no (you don't have to give details why if you don't want).  I'm not like LE trying to get details on this shit, i'm a poor ass guy who doesn't want gadget's n shit but needs about $2k to keep from bankruptcy and frankly don't give two fuck's stealing $2000 from a massive conglomerate as Amazon who steals far more from society as it is already (i'll never steal from an individual, from a large company though ... fuck yeah, esp. if it's not even for my own enjoyment but just to keep my head above the ever rising water that's drowning us all in debt, forclosure, blah). My first thought obviously was ipad's or iphone's, but neither is SOLD by Amazon, they're just FULFILLED by Amazon, and I need to do this DD with item(s) that are both SOLD and FULFILLED by Amazon as i'm sure the Amazon Refunder's and regular user's of this service understand. Oh and i've done an Amazon Refund once before (worked great for a PS4, he couldnt DD which I paid for, screwing me out of the extra 15% (lok something) and just didn't reply but ThinkingForward seems like guy I gotta jump on now while things are still going as good as they look.  Been like 7 months and i've made 2 legit purchases so I think my account wouldnt be suspicious. I did PS4, but they are big, i'd need like 2-3 in an order to make $1000 and size of package is important in my situation (don't ask, live in rural region), would love to buy some like SSD's or CPU's and just have tiny packs come to me, but dunno the success of fencing these kind of items. Hope someone can help, I just wanna get on this before he like most other Amazon Refunder's disappears and he looks by far to be the best i've seen and I really need the money (sob sob, sorry i'm whining). To think of it would laptop's be a decent idea (still bigger package but not as big as having 2 PS4's delivered to me ... twice) .. this is my personal address btw. Thanks, I hope someone can help ... and hell i'm so desperate that fuck the fencing, i'm straight heterosexual but i'll give you fucking head for $2k just so I can keep off the streets lol ... but Amazon Refund seems a bit more ... sterile and STD proof

Have you bought a guide and were disappointed with it because it lacked key details which you tried to ask the vendor and but no response back for whatever reason? Well then this is your guide â this is one of the most complete and thorough guides available! This guide is almost 60 pages long (mostly pictures) â this is as detailed as it gets and will take you by the hand throughout the whole process. WHAT THE GUIDE IS: This guide is a combination of two guides â the first is about how to buy/setup your anonymous domain/hosting package â the next is how to implement the method within the website to make money. WHO THE GUIDE IS FOR: This guide is for the anyone who is serious (and wants to put in alittle bit of work) who needs a long-term method that wonât get burnt easily â with the 10 copies sold here this will last for months if not years â I have been doing this with 5 stores for almost 4 months and Iâm still getting paid. HOW OFTEN DO I GET PAID: You get paid just over every 2 weeks (16 days). WHY ARE YOU SELLING THIS GUIDE: Well I wasnât going to as its been making me a lot of money ($$$$$) but Iâve recently seen this method being sold here (by ScoobyJew) and wanted to offer my own unique take on the method â but with an extremely detailed guide â one that will help you setup the website/method yourself â no need to get someone to make a website for you. SO THIS ISNT YOUR METHOD THEN? This method I developed by myself without anybodyâs help - what happened was I noticed that the techniques used in my method was mentioned in one of the posts and I spoke to the author (ScoobyJew) over PM to confirm (which he did). So I wanted to offer my own version of it â with full access on how to install the website and use the method. Also I havenât seen his guide so wonât be able to comment on what it has/hasnât got â so please donât ask, all I know is we are using the same method. WHAT IS THE STARTUP COSTS: This is the important question everyone who is considering this needs to ask: -    domain name/hosting - $17-    other materials â bare minimum: $90 â (this is dependent on how many CCâs you want to buy for the operation so it can be a lot higher depending on the number of ccâs you wish to buy ) HOW MUCH CAN I MAKE: How long is a piece of string? Really the sky is the limit on this one â I have 5 websites going each pulling in ~$100/day so you can do the math (if you canât please PM me).  HOLY CACA - 60 PAGES!?!! ARE YOU KIDDING???? Yes itâs a big guide but you will be guided through the whole process - the majority of the guide (90%) is pictures, so if you want a smaller guide or already know how to make a website then this guide isnât for you. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS: This is the cool thing about this guide the benefits are: 1.    You get to learn how to make a website QUICKLY â you can use this part of the method for other parts of fraud â not just the included method (think big, win big) â with learning how to make a website, you not relying on someone else building a website that may have malware/Trojans installed â YOU are the master!2.    The method included is an unsaturated market â this wonât get easily burnt.  HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO SETUP AND START MAKING MONEY: - Buy/Host and install ecommerce package â 3 hours- Setting up the method â 2 hours- Making your site legit looking â 5-6 hours depending on how legit looking- Payment is just over every two weeks  YOUR GUIDE IS IN PDF OR DOC FILE FORMAT - SECURITY RISK! Yes, I know I hate guides that are in PDF or DOC format, unfortunately this tutorial is over 60 pages (mostly pictures) so best practice (you should be doing this anyways) is to download and run it in a isolated virtual machine (VM) â stay safe and protect yourself always â even from me. If your not happy with the file format then either pm me details on whatever other format you want (within reason) or donât buy it. IS THIS A TURN-KEY SOLUTIONâ WILL I ALREADY GET A WEBSITE INLCUDED: No, this is not a turn-key solution, I am giving you the opportunity to learn a very useful skill very quickly â one that you can make 1000âs of websites from to scam or even make a legit site (the sky is the limit). WHAT IS THE COST: I think a fair price would be $100 ( you really couldnât get someone to build a decent ecom website for that much) on top of the method guide which is built in â this is a great offer.If you canât afford $100 then you wonât be able to afford the startup costs and this really isnât for you.  Instead of buying only one website for $100 learn how to build them yourself and never have to pay someone again for your scam websites! IS THIS GOOD FOR THE US/UK/EU This guide is good for anywhere, you just need to know what to get (which Iâll explain in the guide). CAN I GET A FREE COPY? I will give ONE copy to one of the EVO/TCF moderators to review my method to make sure I havenât stolen anyoneâs idea and to make sure that its worth the money.

I'm new vendor and I need to get my sales/reviews up - selling a guide @ $500 will not bring in much sales - would you have bought it if it was $500? I don't think so 2. There are a few vendors who are selling turn-key websites + method for $100 - thats who I'm competing against so I should have a similar price. 3. I work around 4-5 hours of work per day doing this (which for some is not alot of time, but for me I have another new venture which requires around the same time and makes more) so I don't need to keep doing this method and once I get paid in alittle over a weeks time - I'm out of this method. 4. Unlike other methods being sold on here for 1.5 BTC etc, this method DOES require startup funds - I state minimum investment, but if your serious about doing this and making as much money as I am then you will be spending ALOT more in startup costs - this is reflected in the cost of the guide - how pissed off would you be if you bought a $500 guide and then had to spend another 200-300 for costs? 5. I'm not the only person using this method and not the only one selling this method (read my description above), I'm undercutting my competitors with a superior product which will guide the newest NOOB to make money not just with the method alone (all methods eventually die, but with learning how to build a website you can use later on to do other methods).

You're not selling a superior product. You're selling a method you haven't actually used with a guide on how to build a website. You cried the other week to me about not selling my method to more than 3 people because it would get burnt. Then a week later you're selling the method yourself starting at $500. You put two and two together and worked out what payment gateway I was using. Your guide also includes certain information I gave you. Phonepal yeah? You used them a lot have you? You told me you had been doing the method for 2 months. Now you're lying to people and telling them 4 months... You're using my name to sell your product as well.

Stick to your vendor post, if you have a problem with my method then PM me or put it in your vendor post, don't hijack a vendor post - you should know this.  2. Does it matter if I've done it for 2 or 4 months? This method works I've used it (prove otherwise), I've made money from it - so have you!  My method is cheaper and more detailed than yours - if people want value for money and a thoroughly detailed guide then buy mine, if you want a guide that can't go into details of how to execute the method, then buy SJ's. Simple Also I've already had FRIM review and give it a positive review - I'm not selling garbage - I've put time and effort into making it, not spent a night writing it out, why don't you send him your guide and see which one is better value for money?

Might extend to other brands as well but we haven't tested anything else. There are basically no requirements, it's that simple. No real profit, just some fun and a free coffee (maybe some other goodies if you do well). This has nothing to do with reward points, gift cards, stealing, carding etc. It's way more simple. We are not offering vouches as the listing's been up for a while now and we have enough feedback on it. The price is as low as it gets. Feel free to chip in extra.If you are completely broke and desperate, hit us up anyway and we'll figure something out.  Only thing is: By buying this guide you agree not to leave a negative feedback! The reason for this is that the guide and the price of it are not worth fucking up the feedback of our main line of business. for someone who expected a gold mine or something.We are making it very clear - this is a simple method how to get a free drink or more at any Starbucks. Nothing more, nothing less. 9/10 times success rate. IF you are super unhappy with the guide for some inexplicable reason - we will refund the 3 quid or however much you decided to pay.

You only have to look at the Freedom Hosting sting for a recent example of that. Windows offers an attacker a much bigger attack surface and it's also used on over 90% of the PC's world wide. That means that anyone wanting large scale results will go after the biggest target on offer and that's Windows users I'm afraid. Before you delve into this further, do a stack of research prior to commiting to your set-up. It's very important.","lightbloood wrote:ok then would it be better to download virtualbox to my mac os and then run windows on it to connect to a windows rdp so it would be mac osx -> connect to vpn -> boot windows through virtualbox-> connect to rdp"

I'd like to know he answer to is question as well please. I'm torn between a bunch of different setups when it comes to Initial OPSEC. ,There are so many posts that like to contradict each other. I've been researching for a few months now and I'm finally ready to make a move just deciding which security setup I should go with on my burner. too bad before this I never used computers I still have so many technical questions. Researched money making methods before security lol that was the problem.   I have a close family friend who works at a computer shop who has no idea what I do and doesn't give a fuck to try and find out. I dropped off an old laptop there so he could examine the charger for me. I think I'm just going to go and talk to him and throw some ideas at him that I've gotten from my research to see what he says. I would imagine he knows better than anyone(probably not as much as some if you fraudsters on here) I have some ideas and know what I want but I shall use his help and advice to install everything or me. Btw anyone think that's a breach of opsec? I don't think that could lead back to me at all, could it ? Just having my computer tech/family friend fix a laptop and basically walk me through my security/encryption setup. Him knowing about my setup might spark some ideas why I may need so much security but I'm paying him to work on my laptop anyways.  I think I can do most of the shit myself but I fear I'll fuck up which would not be good so I would rather have help this first time.   I was originally thinking of something like this as a setup : pub wifi>os>tails>VPN>vm>Rdp/socks ( not sure if I can run a VPN in tails or if it should go tails>vm>vpn) sorry if I made a mistake as I am NOT a tech guy st all really but I'm trying.  ^ that was easy enough for me to understand. Then someone told me I needed a VPN on my OS, so I wouldn't be able to load tails on the USB....then I looked into tails in a vm and people spoke bad about it. Then all the true crypt debate came along.  The newest thing I've been told to look Into and been researching is whonix and whole disk encryption..Saw someone mention L.U.K.S file encryption and been looking into that.  That basic Debian >tails>vm>vpn>rdp/socks would be preferable though since I fully understand it lol. And the file saving on persistent volumes also sounds enjoyable. Another plus is that I can do this one myself. so what's wrong with it? Can anyone comment on a setup like that?  Also about getting help from family friend who works on computers , does everyone think that's okay, as long as I don't ask too much ?   As soon as my opsec is 100% I'm ready to begin.  P.s. Is it okay to have poor opsec when only researching ?  Damn^^ sorry if I wrote to much or posted in the wrong place I just started typing and going on a rant.I apologize if I went off topic and if my text is misorganized.. Any comments on the subjects would be appreciated though. Thank you.","nameful wrote:What would I use to run a VM in Tails?

It's too cumbersome for that... wasn't really made for that. Also keep in mind you MUST include TOR somewhere in your setup. Also as mentioned before... do not mention your activity to your family or involve them.  Here is a setup that might be worth considering. Buy laptop for cash, disable it's network card. Setup a strong BIOS password. Then use an Linux OS as a host and do full disk encryption. Once inside create a Vera crypt or TrueCrypt7.1a or w/e you prefer container and a hidden container within it... Install a VPN that you downloaded/paid for anonymously in that hidden folder, then install a VB or VM and put Whonix in it, and another VPN. Then go to town with socks 5/rdp etc... You could also get an VPS, connect to it and install OS of your choice with an windows OS in VM, then do socks/rdp etc. All incriminating stuff kept on SD card or USB drive and the like,",""

There are many Linux / Unix operating systems to choose from such as Whonix, Qubes, OpenBSD, etc that provide a level of security you would never find on any Windows system. Qubes is a good choice IMO as every application runs from inside a VM. You can create as many VM's as you require such as one for Tor, one for PGP (encryption) related applications, etc, etc. Basically Qubes will provide you with virtual isolation of Tor from applications as well as virtual isolation of applications from each other making it much harder for an attacker to pwn your system using something such as an application layer attack.","HoudiniXpress wrote:Windows 8 is not a good idear, or any windows, you will want to run linux for your laptop."

Overall: Excellent Guide, advised for newbies, intermediates and probably experts, cause information on pp is never to much.. a penny price for the info it gives.. focus, on getting pp accounts, where and how, hacked or fresh, aging it and therefore.. focus on the transfer to MM and MM to Cashout account which is the hard part, and with this tips less mistakes will happen, and not burn the scheme of the gateway you will work with. gives tips to perform your own pp transfers, which is also good to be less dependent from pp transfers vendors  (however always need them cause its hard to keep the delivery of transfers!!) the info about CB is crucial, cause at some point your cashout accs will always get soft limited and the tips, are very good, to get seller protection and win CB..which also is a must for this business.. a big thanks to MH9 for sharing is knowledge and imho this guide is a must to have and a penny for the price, cause you have money back in no time.. thanks",""

Offer refund services? Sell SE guides? In attempt to gain more sympathy from the community, you posted this bullshit that you were sick and you were going away for a couple of weeks. But that shit never happened. You were never sick. You were trying to cry out to the community. This is my last post. Seriously, be original if you want to earn money. Not trying to make money by trying to copy someone else's content. Your guide was posted:2014-10-08 09:48:29 My interest check for my guide was posted on:2014-10-04 13:04:50 It was my fault for putting the details in public. I guess you leeched it well.

Your not the only one offering services, and you say about the middleman accounts yes i did an interest check, there is also other vendors which sell these, so what ? and for your information i was involved in an accident, i was going to take time off BUT i was getting bored when away from the PC i could not go out and venture so what else could i do ?  There is also other people selling PayPal guides so why is all your attention on me ? also commenting at least once on nearly every post i do.......",""

It sure looks like that from where I'm standing... you always had desperate/acid comments to write all over MH9's threads, even long before this alleged ""copyright"" claim, implying somehow that you are the only one allowed to sell whatever over here. I really don't understand your hate towards MH9, but I could easily detect it since day 1, long before today, and it is only natural to stand up and speak for a friend and a partner who helped me make good money and never failed me, not even once, and who is far from being a scammer or a cheap Yasuo replica, like you are implying here... this is what friends are for.

About difficulty, this will depends on your previous skills, but the most important thing here is all the info provided is working and updated and also MH9 always reply to my questions, even I purchased the guide some weeks ago and he is not making any new profits replying my questions. But I also did hard job and invested time learning. With other resources included in the guide, I managed to do my first ato to paypal account and also open first bank account drop myself. The guide it is absolutely worth the money, you can be 100% sure about that.

After buying this guide I am pretty much half-broke so I will need to prepare more coins for further actions. 2) Does it require any high level of SE? From my country, SE through phones are pretty much impossible due to my government requires sim card to be verified using valid I.D, however I am ok if SE through email is possible or even better, zero SE, which something it is pretty much impossible. Anyway, thanks for the patience to handling a noob like me and I hope I can purchase your guide soon if my question is answered and clarified. Thanks a lot pal.",""

A large amount you will get the letter too but likely a cop or worse a swat team at your door one day soon after if not before.Stick to personal amounts where possible when ordering from international vendors. Let someone else take the risk if you plan to order large amounts and get them domestic. Thats my two cents. All the same though its fairly safe to import small amounts into Canada. I doubt you will receive any letters ever especially if its just personal amounts in an envelope. Even customs rarely bothers to open packages. They tend to be happy with charging taxes on whatever declared value is on the package  plus their fee instead. They are lazy jerks thankfully

A large amount you will get the letter too but likely a cop or worse a swat team at your door one day soon after if not before.Stick to personal amounts where possible when ordering from international vendors. Let someone else take the risk if you plan to order large amounts and get them domestic. Thats my two cents.All the same though its fairly safe to import small amounts into Canada. I doubt you will receive any letters ever especially if its just personal amounts in an envelope. Even customs rarely bothers to open packages. They tend to be happy with charging taxes on whatever declared value is on the package  plus their fee instead. They are lazy jerks thankfully "

Do you know if customs would ever check the name on the package and run the name through their computers?  ( I had a minor incident at a border crossing years ago, no charges though)   Also, what sort of amount would you consider a small amount? would 5 Grams be ok?  I would have to think so just because they are used to seizing much larger quantities and 5 grams of powder looks so small... thanks",""

"Evolution Forums","invaderZIM","56343","2015-03-17T00:00:00","Re: WorldOpen & Heinrichs MyCashout","Guides Vendors","I received a copy of this guide and will leave me review. First of all, everything that will be written here is my opinion, and in no way I was influenced by the authors of the guide about what I should or shouldn't write here. Let's start: The guide comes in PDF format, with 6 pages of text and a few images. They will give you a few tips on OPsec if you don't know shit about it. Also, you will know the resources you need to maintain your paypal account (which you can buy or make them yourself - also taught on the guide) and apply the codes. You'll be taught what (and when) you should do and what you shouldn't do. Then you get some different ways of cashing out the accounts - pretty straightforward - you can get cash or bitcoins. The negative part of this method, is that you must have some money to start (a single code is $300 or more). However, if you already have an account and set-up ready, you will get the ROI in the first code you apply in it. If you don't have an account and set-up ready, you will get your investment back + profit on the second code applied. All in all, you can make as many accounts as you wish. About the price, I think it should be max $100, so who doesn't have the resources needed will have a bit more to invest in them. Last but not least, thanks to Heinrich and Worldopen for giving me the opportunity to review this guide.",""

Seriously, there's only so much cock sucking I can do to show my appreciation to this guy, so I'll try to keep it short! It was a brief session as we both didn't have live fullz to test with. However he demonstrated proof of concept and his explanations and walkthrough were spot on. I see no reason why it will not work.  He introduced me to sites that really help strengthen the process of successfully receiving funds. He took me through step-by-step exactly what is required, reassuring me that he is there to hand hold me along the way. His thorough guidance introduced me to useful companies I didn't even know existed in the credit game within the UK. His process has been beautifully crafted. It's both elegant and brilliant.  And now it's time to take down the score! anonpsychosis has identified weaknesses in specific banks where an instant Â£500 awaits, and where patience pays off giving you another Â£3000, perhaps more! All from 1 fullz. This tutoring session really exploits our credit hungry society, exposing the laziness and incompetence of our financial companies. Welcome to carding 2.0.

NOW THIS SESSION IS Â£1000/1500$ SORRY IF YOU MISSED OUT ON THE OPENING OFFER BUT THIS TUTORING SESSION IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!! Link: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/89906 THERE IS NO WRITTEN GUIDE THIS, IT IS ONE ON ONE INSTRUCTION 100% I will provide ONGOING support and the class will last around 1-2 hours. This tutoring session will show you how to setup your OWN UK bank with UK fullz and best of you YOU WILL NOT NEED A DROP ADDRESS, each of these account comes with a overdraft facility, setting up can be done within a few minutes providing you have good fullz. I will teach you how to open, load and cashout these accounts. I will also provide you MY personal method how to fund these accounts with upto Â£3k a time (this will take around 2 working days). I will teach you a method how to cashout from the bank for people who don't know how. Key points to consider;- I will be giving you 2 companies, both of which you can make money with- You will start making money the instance I provide you with the training- I will teach you MY own method how to ensure your not wasting time with crap fullz- Make the most out of your UK fullz don't just delete them when the card is burnt!- You will need a good basis of the ENGLISH language if you haven't please do not purchase- If you don't have fullz with you for the tutoring I can supply these at Â£22 each.  Q&A; Q: How much capital will I need for this session?A: You will only need VM, SOCKS, Fullz. Q: What type of support do I get?A: I will provide 100% support through your first bank opening and ongoing support thereafter Q: Will this make me a millionaire overnight?A: No! You will need to invest time into this average being 1 hour to open a bank. Q: How long will this work for?A: These are big companies so the method should last a LONG time Q: Can I fuck up?A: Yes! Follow my teachings and you will be fine. Q: How quick will I make my money back?A: When you successfully setup the bank I will show you how to get an overdraft and you will get most if not ALL of your money back then? Q: Why are you selling this guide?A: I don't see this method burning any time in the near future, I can still use this method and would like to help some of my collegues. Q: Why is the guide priced so high?A: To stop potential leakage, I invest my time teaching and you will be making the money back very quickly Q: I don't live in the UK, will this still work?A: YES! this will work WORLDWIDE you don't need to be in the UK we have socks for that  ###WHAT TO BRING WITH YOU TO THE SESSION### 1, YOURSELF2, UK FULLZ3, COMMON SENSE4, SOCKS5, atleast 2 hours time ******TERMS OF SALE******** WHEN BUYING THIS LISTING YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS************* 1) I am not responsible if you fuck up your accounts and they get locked2) If you go against my Teachings Do not bitch to me if shit gets fucked up my methods work.. yours are untested as of now.3) My current students for my other guides know I am easy to get a hold of, got a question shoot me it on ICQ. Want my ICQ Pm me4) Will I take your goods as payment? NO!6) You agree to finalize as soon as the session is over!  When you go to McDonalds and order food, you do not tell them you are not going to pay cause the food did not fill your belly up. You pay for that shit when they give it to you... As you can see this is a VOUCHED tutoring session from one of the top vendors on evo and it will be Â£500/$750 for the first 5 buyers then will double after that!!!!        This last review is from my listing look at my feedback on EVO I think the reviews speak for themselves

Even a four year old could do this and for something this easy the earning potential is crazy.anonpsychosis will hold your hand and fill your pockets with cash with his one to one support, excellent customer service, and step by step tutorial what more do you want?In short: This method works for opening a bank account, no drop needed. You learn some seriously cool stuff like how to get a credit profile, and get credit, to your new account, all in under two hours, even cashout.If your still deciding to go ahead with this or not then I can only say trust my vouch being a Level 5 Vendor, one of the biggest if not the biggest for Fraud on Evolution and the biggest contributor to the Evolution 2015 Raffle with years of experience, you won't see many more methods like this.

Seriously, there's only so much cock sucking I can do to show my appreciation to this guy, so I'll try to keep it short!It was a brief session as we both didn't have live fullz to test with. However he demonstrated proof of concept and his explanations and walkthrough were spot on. I see no reason why it will not work. He introduced me to sites that really help strengthen the process of successfully receiving funds. He took me through step-by-step exactly what is required, reassuring me that he is there to hand hold me along the way.His thorough guidance introduced me to useful companies I didn't even know existed in the credit game within the UK.His process has been beautifully crafted. It's both elegant and brilliant. And now it's time to take down the score! anonpsychosis has identified weaknesses in specific banks where an instant Â£500 awaits, and where patience pays off giving you another Â£3000, perhaps more! All from 1 fullz.This tutoring session really exploits our credit hungry society, exposing the laziness and incompetence of our financial companies. Welcome to carding 2.0.

You need to falsify these docs. However I must honestly say there wasn't any tutoring for this, I made a mistake on my first verify, which has led till now i have not made a penny yet :x Also a guy i know that bought this method has had this problem.Im seriously worried that if one of the companies used will receive a lot of bad verify docs the method will get burned quick..

(if you can spend the money on this tutoring session you should atleast know how to edit docs or how to use the search function on evo to find docs) I do provide ways to CASHOUT to bitcoin, it should be pretty simple as you have the money in the bank account YOU made and it won't be getting limited or charged back anytime soon. If you need more methods I'm around to help. Everyone who's PM'd me i've replied unless it's stupid like can I get it for free I will not respond. THIS METHOD WORKS 100% BUT YOU NEED TO USE YOUR BRAIN ASWELL - REMEMBER I WILL GIVE YOU THE BASICS, AND YOU BUILD ON THIS.... Would you rather me give you a fish to feed your family for a day or teach you how to fish and feed your family for a lifetime? Kalashnikov did cashout in the end using his own bank to BTC method, I offered alternatives to him but he thought his would work better, for this method you do need DOCS which is NOT hard.

The developers say ""Only run Tails in a virtual machine if leaving traces on the hard disk is not a concern for you.""

I could have also sold it as a service, but I am not able to guarantee an upgrade within a few days, which would be required to release funds in escrow. The upgrade process can take anything between a few days and a few weeks depending on how fast the airline processes it. Anyways, in addition to this tutorial, I am then also offering my help for certain services needed in order to get the Star Alliance Gold status (more then in the tutorial). I do want to send out 2 vouch copies to experienced members as well. Please do let me know. NO CARDING, HACKING, ETC.!!! IT IS 100% LEGAL!!!  Update: Vouch copies have been sent out and feedback has been left. Thank you very much!  UPDATE March 3rd: Version 2.0 is now available!This version now also shows you how you can get OneWorld Sapphire (mid tier) status. This will give you business class check-in and business lounge access among other benefits. I kindly ask people who bought V 1.0 to send me a PM in order to receive the V 2.0 for FREE.

The method works and the time it takes to get upgraded depends on how fast the airline staff works (which is unfortunately out of my control). But as I told you over PM, in one case it took quite long as well and then I got in touch with them via social media and suddenly it worked perfectly fine. Some people report it took just a few days, others report it took weeks. Thus you should always consider that! PS: also edited the first post. It is now reflecting the upgrade process time as well.

If it's not enough, you can always ask help via PM, and finally if failure persists we meet on ICQ or Jabber and I guide you step by step. I've got a few customers who never carded b4 buying this guide from me. I helped them and they succeed. The hardest part in my guide is not the carding, is the poker one. Cause it's really important that you don't loose your carded money randomly to other players.  2: Pretty much same consequences of carding in general. I've included lots of tips about security and I think it's really hard to get caught if you follow my guide. Usually you must starting to be worried if you are constantly carding a lot of money.  If you have other questions let me know","GreenSpider wrote:Hi, i'm very intersted in this guide.

(I am going to have to read it several times to digest all the info in the guide) The first thing you will notice is that THEpokerGuy is no Novice to the poker world. This is Not a copy and paste guide! You can tell that he is writing from experience and not from reading a poker book.The guide is pdf and it is 47 pages long and divided by very detail sections (see summary of the guide above) every section is explained with details and examples. As previously stated you'll need at least basic poker knowledge to get this started or be willing to learn poker basics. There is an entire section that teaches you how to improve your poker game and the different hand strengths.The good news is that THE Poker Guy sounds very willing and interested in helping each member of his system become successful. In my case I've played some Limit poker and I already know that this is going to require some set up time and studying in order to get started. In the end the guide provides a way to make money and if you have a team or if you are hand selected by THE poker Guy to be a part of his playing team no doubt that you will make much more money.In Summary, I've read a couple of poker books and I can tell you that ThePokerguy's detail and the knowledge of poker and poker fraud is superior to any poker book that I have read. This guy and his team are the real deal when it comes to poker fraud, they are no amateurs and I have confidence that if I follow his system and with his support I will make money with this guide, no doubt about it. If you like poker, if you have played poker online or if you are interested in learning poker and poker fraud this guide is for you! 100% recommended. Cheers!"

As long as it's possible to card, the method will work, as simple as that.. It's a well planned, delicate fraud, that takes a decent amount of time. What's most important, to make good money you need to put some work into improving your poker skills. I think this guide is the best for people, that already know how to play poker. As a noob I've also found a lot of other interesting things. I especially liked getting IDs easily for free (love the method).  I'd say one should be prepared to put in decent amount of work for profits somewhere between 2-9k $/euro per month, depending on your skill level.

About big bucks: depends by how much do you mean for big money, I know for sure that some customers are making money cause they asked for help and I followed them personally step by step until success. Some of them never asked support so I really dunno. Some of them still have to make 1$ because I'm helping them in using my kind of security setup and that can take a while if you never used a VM.

Hi all!  First of all, I want to thank you everyone who made this guide possible. Without your interest I doubt that I would write a guide of almost 50 pages. Several copies has been sold until now and I'm very happy of your feedbacks. Plus even if they are really positive, I will try to improve this project as much as I can, and as long as you bros will be interested in this I will not stop. This guide it's about Poker Fraud. Online poker can be great for carding, scamming and of course to cash-out money. It can even become your main income for the rest of your life cause the main methods described here, will never burn.  Online poker is my main job. This guide requires basically two things from you: effort and basic poker knowledge. I don't think Poker Fraud is for lazy people, but if you are looking to learn a method that will never burn you have found it. The final price is set to 200$. From me you will also have full support and every new update will be totally free. And of course all future updates of this guide will be based on your doubts and needs. In this way you help me in helping you to have all knowledge possible about Online Poker Fraud in one single guide. I decided to take this particular project to a next level: I've created a private support community, only known and accessible to the users of this guide. Right now, the guide is at version 1.1. Carding knowledge is not essential for this guide: a full tutorial on how to card is included, and if that, for any reason is not enough I will follow you step by step until you manage to actually card. About poker knowledge: it's not enough to just know the rules of Texas Hold'Em No Limit. I'm already trying to improve the guide in this way, to make it 100% noob friendly. Right now you need at least to have played some online poker and to know basic online poker terms.Maybe the guide can work anyway for you, but your first cashout can be delayed because of this. That's why I recommend, before purchasing, to send me a PM (or write right here in this topic) with all your doubts and questions. I'll try to reply to you asap!

My words here are only my honest opinion of his guide as I have read it.Overview: The guide is provided in a 47 page pdf. I was expecting this to contain graphics and diagrams where appropriate, but actually this is 47 pages of full-on text/information!The guide starts off with a general overview of carding with a particular slant in regards to poker fraud, which contains real solid information that many people will not be aware of. Then it talks about verification of the accounts, with some neat tricks that had me grinning when I read them.The bulk of the guide consists of how to cash out/move money between poker accounts, and the way you need to play in order to do so successfully. I am sure many people who have tried to chipdump/card poker rooms before have had the same problems I have had, maybe you have managed to move some cash , but in general accounts have got locked or withdrawals denied and you give up thinking it is just not worth it. Well, thepokerguy has got you covered. The information he provides makes so much sense when you read it, but you will not have thought it before. It is really this part of the guide that you are paying for, it is obvious when you read it that he has been a professional poker player first, who has added the fraud element later and so has developed a way to obscure the chipdumping with strategies to avoid detection. I was very impressed with this.But that's not all. The next part talks about working in a team, and in fact thepokerguy is looking to set up teams within the people who purchase the guide. This IMO is a great idea, because for the less experienced putting all the elements of this guide into action could be overwhelming, but working as a team will share the workload and responsibility, and give better profits for everyone.Finally, the guide goes a bit deeper into poker strategies that you will need to study in order to maximise your success, as well as a few other poker related scams that you may wish to take advantage of. There are also good tips on security set-ups you need, which apply not only to poker but also other types of fraud, and then some vulnerable sites to hit.Conclusion:  You can probably tell that I was very impressed with this guide and it offers a way to make a lot of money, but IT IS NOT for everyone. Really you need to have some poker knowledge, or at least be willing to learn outside of the guide. Also it is not a get-rich-quick type of scheme, you will need to put in time and effort, but if you do then you can be making money from this for years to come.So, if you have never played a game of cards and prefer to laze around doing fuck-all I would not recommend this guide. But, if you want to make some big bucks, and you know what 'pocket-aces' means, then buy now and get involved in something big!;Fullfargo wrote:I bought the guide yesterday and gave it a proper read.I must say it's the best  Ive read on evo so far. It is exactly as descripted by ""thepokerguy"" in this topic.Guide is very well written and concise, easy to read and with every detail to make the methods work.Now, when you read this guide you can tell this guy knows his shit and he has been doing this for a while.Pros:- Methods are really really hard to burn. IMO one method explained here (the most important) WILL NEVER BURN.- You can find 3 different methods in this guide so even the most newbie can make money out of this- Huge extra tips you can find here, about poker, carding, security, I even learned how to get real scan IDs for free..Cons:- At least for the most important method (where you can make real money): YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND POKER. There is no other way, So if you dont have any idea what texas holdem is and you have no interesting in learning either, then this guide is not for you.;IssueAnnon wrote:The ONLY guide on ALL of evolution that is a REAL guide. The product isn't a crappy, full of grammatical and spelling errors picture pamphlet like every other guide I have read from evo. Pages and pages of incredibly well written, detailed, professional information coming from a master of his craft. Highly recommended! Thank you for all the time and effort you have invested into creating the Poker Bible. +++++/+++++;xsane wrote:Guys I've bought a copy and wanna tell you somethng.. if only I could take all the money I spent on useless outdated and so called straightfoward but still nonworking guides and give them to Pokerguy I would have done it for sure. It's been the first time I'm really satisfied with what I get for the sum of money I've invested. I've never seen such a thorough and detailed guide ever. No 'you will find out the rest for yourself' bullshit. It will be usefull for everyone who is into the carding thing since it has lots and lots of universal tips that filled in the holes of ignorence in my knowledge. While reading It feels like vendor do wanna share all his experience with his buyers. The guide is very well-written and packed like a cargo container with useful info. I'm just on a half way through of reading it and had to stop for a while to have it digested before going on. Especially I wanna emphasize the fact that every buyer got his serial number and life-long subscription. I feel like a million dollar customer. Thanx for bringing a clearnet level of support to the deepweb. I'm so glad to get a copy that it even made me write my first post Looking forward to testing all this amazing info and joining the team of like-minded mates.;punpuner wrote:I bought a guide out of curiosity. I've been playing poker for several years, mostly tournaments but I see how money can be made with it. Not really my cup of tea now, as I make decent semi-legal income, but might use it in the future when I start loosing lol. I see carding involved, and for a total noob like me, not everything was clear, but I believe Pokerguy will help you out. The guide itself is really well written, and Pokerguy must have put a shitload of work into creating this. It's not possible for the method to get burned. As long as it's possible to card, the method will work, as simple as that.. It's a well planned, delicate fraud, that takes a decent amount of time. What's most important, to make good money you need to put some work into improving your poker skills. I think this guide is the best for people, that already know how to play poker.As a noob I've also found a lot of other interesting things. I especially liked getting IDs easily for free (love the method). I'd say one should be prepared to put in decent amount of work for profits somewhere between 2-9k $/euro per month, depending on your skill level. The guide is real, there is no bullshit like get rich in a week."

It is very good for newbies and noobs because the reader will learn everything from scratch (Opsec, VPN, VM,.....) So it includes: Everything about the setup and how to use the right CCs ( Tor, VPN, VM, Poker Software, Fulls, AVS, SSN, etc...). Infos about socks and if you should use VIP 72 or not.What poker rooms have good opsec and which have not. Why do people fail at chip dumping. How to withdraw money. The poker software you need. How to play your 2 or more accounts that you do not get busted ( fish, tight, rock,....). How to make poker frauds in teams. A good list of starting websites and a list of websites that you should avoid. What to do if your account gets frozen. And a full guide of how to improve your poker game. In my opinion a great guide that is worth the money. 47 pages just words, no pictures, no useless filling material. Just knowledge. This guide is great.

I really can't remember all the users that asked me this.  I've changed some things in the test, now it's really difficult to just google the answers. Please remember the goal of this test: send a vouch/free copy to a real professional poker player. How it works: 1- You send me a pm and tell me you are interested in trying the test cause you want to prove that you are a real online poker player.2- I send you the link and pass for the test.3- You got 1 day starting from the exact time I give you the link to complete the test.4- Once you are done with the test, be sure to send me a pm. I will not consider anyone who will need more than 24 hours to complete this.5- This test will be available for 5 days. When this 5 days have passed I will check the results, and send the vouch copy to the best one. Every question in this test has not a single right or wrong  answer. I rate this test by analyzing your thinking process, and every question will require you to fill a little box of text.It's nearly impossible to cheat in this test and win.

I know, right now it looks like ""pay the guide and you are in"" cause I always wanted to do something more then just a guide, and that's why I'm offering full support + forums too... but it's only a starting point.  Right now at least 20 ppl will have an account there. I dunno how much of this 20s will be active and interested in learning more & more about carding, we'll see! So right now the priority it's creating a community reserved for the customers, cause by reading this guide you know that you can do $$$ alone, but at the same time you know that in team you can always do 10 times or more that amount of money. By connecting users between each other everyone can earn more.  Then, once the community it's a little bit solid and active we'll decide together what to do, by voting. That's the idea!","sketchywatson wrote:Okay- I've only been at it for a few months so will hold out for now.

Especially if you are in the beginning and you are carding low amounts. A laptop I think it's required for any kind of ""dark"" activity around here, and securing all your setup in SD or usb drive it's not that hard or expensive. Anyway I think it's way too much changing your real location every time. You can stay in the same location until you start to cashout really BIG amounts frequently. Unless you are already under the eye of LE for something else you did.","Abram123 wrote:Am I right , or do you need to go around war driving with a burner laptop and tails on an SD card , ready to swallow?"

I was thinking of registering for the new AusPost parcel lockers which send a PIN number along with a locker number to access your preffered parcel locker destination. Has anybody else tried this or think that this is a good idea? I am leaning more towards this as the package is left there so never requires a signature. Pickup package after AusPost trading hours -> take package home and put beside front door without opening -> open next day if all is good and put in a nice hiding spot for a few days.

What can I say, for Â£6, it is definite value for money. At lot of it is common sense (but that is the opinion of someone that has experience, and has read a few guides). A lot of the info you will find in other guides, that is not to say it is unoriginal, just that there is a template to these things. That said, it does offer a few unique ideas that I have not heard before - whether they work or not, I have not tested. I like the general advice about not getting caught at the end of the guide. Perfect for newbies. A lot of it seems obvious to me, but when I read some of the questions on threads, then I think some people need things to be made clear to them. There are guides out there that offer more detail about how to do it multiple times, using hacked accounts, and alternative ideas in general. But for a new-starter with limited funds, then this is somewhere to start, and offers great value for money.

To be honest anybody who has  asked for a copy I have sent.  I'd post it for free but Â£6 is not even a packet of smokes. Why these Top refund guy's Offer the service and I agree to an extent, it's a good service  some people have the money to order products but don't have the time to call amazon etc and some people don't even have the confidence to answer a phone call yet alone start saying things about xxxxxx and what's gone on. I have refunded since the days of nonni moss back in the start then he became ill, new members won't remember him good lad. Anyway to get refunds don't be greedy and if things  go into investigation sometimes they do always stick to the same story and be patient if this happens never blatantly ask for a refund if you order an xbox and it arrives leave it a day and then do what the guide say's. Excuses play on heart string's you have had to replace this birthday present this morning it was expected to be here because I ordered with yourself as you the worlds most well known company has caused me alarm and distress  now I have a young child whom could have been without a present.Ask how they would feel never get angry be calm.  If when you phone they say it will take 24hrs ask to speak to a supervisor say you cannot wait this is a matter of urgency. Listen guy's I'm no fool and when you quote a few terms and put them on the back foot because most the time amazon always fuk the orders up over christmas I personally refunded over 20k and I have never had a knock back ever. Buy the guide try it before you attempt it message me once i no you have payed Â£6 i will tell you what to say and do. These triple dips can be done but as i have said greed will get the account's banned double dips are fine on accounts with buying history if you use your head you can use one account to get buying history using the stuff you have purchased on that account and use that as an excuse saying no more about that.

"Evolution Forums","Samarium","53925","2015-03-11T22:38:14","Re: Can LE do this?","Security & Anonymity","It depends what jurisdiction you are in as there are different rules on entrapment. I believe in general they can't persuade you to do anything that you wouldn't otherwise do. So they couldn't message you and say hey look I have loads of cheap drugs i give you special offer wanna buy etc as that would be trying to persuade you to break the law. However if you go to them and buy drugs from them then they are not persuading you to buy drugs and its not entrapment. However, conspiracy to buy drugs is not a crime so they would have to actually send you drugs and catch you with them (assuming only small amounts for personal use otherwise they could go after you for conspiracy to supply). I would think most courts would frown on not only posing as drug dealers but acting as actual drug dealers and I would think it would be thrown out early on. In any case going to such lengths to catch buyers would be very expensive and not worth the hassle.  Note that its different for sellers as conspiracy to sell drugs *is* an offence and the LE acting as a buyer would not bring the criminal justice system into disrepute.  Note also that for other crimes acting as a vendor would be justified as conspiracy to buy would be a crime (consipiracy to commit fraud if buying fake IDs, conspiracy to commit murder if buying a hitman etc). So in summary I wouldn't get overly concerned about buying (for personal use) as you'd have to be very unlucky to be prosecuted

My home.  Me.  I think the last thing I want to do is buy an item or even a drug that gets flagged, then tracked to the it's delivery and bam, there I or my spouse is picking up said item.  I travel around my state and neighboring states daily.  But finding a trusted place to accept mail I can pick-up in a fake name is feeling next to impossible.  2) It's possible that at some point the USPS will eventually forward something addressed to the previous owner's NEW address.  At worst I lose the money from not getting what I ordered.   If anyone on here lives anywhere near ""tornado ally"", and you have a good drop location/idea, please PM me to speak privately.  Anyone else, what would you do?",""

Ive even had to disable my vendor account for a while just so that i could put more work into making this method a 4k cashout per day. As of right now i have been refining the method and creating setups that people can buy from me so they can start cashing out 1k-6k (Depending on how much work you put in) per day. I have been messing around with paypal and this method for the last couple of weeks and i finally have it down so that i can cashout 1k-6k per day. Now this is not easy work but anybody can do it if they are willing to put the work in. Thankfully you will not have to put work into creating the setup because i will be selling the paypal setup accounts with the method. So with this method it will include the full setup and multiple paypal accounts so that you can start cashing out the same day. Now there are a few different cashouts but the two main cashouts that i recommend and use are 1. Withdrawing cash from an atm. 2. Converting the funds to btc. You can do either one and they both work great.  *** STORE LINK *** http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/store/326093  ****READ EVERYTHING BEFORE POSTING QUESTIONS.

But in my method i provide a list of a few sites i use and ways to obtain the funds without carding or taking transfers. But you also have the option to card and take transfers to get the funds.- My websites (Noob Friendly Option) This is also the highest money making option. It is very easy and it is just taking advantage of multiple websites that have low/no security.-Carding-Transfers-Paypal Mycash In the method it explains how to cashout funds straight to btc. I have multiple websites and methods so that you can cashout as much as you need straight to btc.It also explains methods on how to get funds in your bank account the same day so that you can go to an atm and withdraw cash.  Intial Investment After you buy the setup. Depending on how much you want to cashout the first day the investment varies. But you can start out with as little as $100 and build up from there. It takes money to make money so if you want be be making 6k per day youre going to need the capital to invest in the beginning ($500-$1200). But it shouldnt be a problem because you will be getting back all the money in btc or in cash within a couple hours later. THIS WILL WORK WORLDWIDE BUT YOU WILL BE WORKING WITH USA ACCOUNTS. CASHOUTS WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE VIA ATM    *** STORE LINK *** http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/store/326093

Method involves using fullz to get funds the same day into the bank drop or paypal account. It doesnt involve carding its more of like applying for a loan but it is very easy on the vunerable websites. one of the websites you can literally have the loan websites send it directly to the website where you convert to btc and you will have btc by the end of the day. scans - idk if cream made them himself, but as a photoshop guy i can say they look really good. paypal accounts with rdp's - awesome, runs well, not much to say here. bank drops - that's where my biggest problem ever was - getting them. but not it's cool. he also shows how to obtain them yourself. i don't have mail drop so i asked creamknowledge not to send me physical cards. already applied few mycash vouchers and received semi clean funds to the paypal accounts. money is sitting in the bank drop now, about to cash out to btc."

I'm selling this because I don't like dealing with physical items myself, it's simply part of my security system.  This method simply cannot be saturated by 1 person, it is extremely profitable and has the potential to make your money back in one shipment.  PRICE: $1,000Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/1398 My level or pricing correlates with the methods quality, I hope I have authenticated my legitimacy from my other private method which has now sold out.I understand that this may be considered pricey to some, but if you want a sustainable source of income with no chance of saturation, this is your answer.

If you read the method, you'd realise that just by reading it you can tell it works, it's that simplistic  2. Who said it was just one site? as stated this is a large chain of sites 3. Definition of method = ""a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one."" - These are sites with identically weak payment gateways, my method is the way in which these sites can be found and the procedure in which the vulnerability is manipulated. Also, I have a 5BTC turnover in 1 week from my other method. It's supply and demand, just because you're a poverty kid who can't afford quality methods it doesn't mean it's overpriced.  Now fuck off back to playing Call Of Duty, you sound about 13 saying 'lol' after every sentence.

Then I send the funds randomly to up to 20 different deposit addresses in bitcoin fog, I don't have one wallet with all the funds in, that'd be stupid.  I can show you my method orders for this week, which amounts to around 2.5K GBP - but that doesn't vouch for my personal carding ventures as they're withdrawn via ATM, not bitcoin. Also I'm almost crying with laughter over your wallet proof. Total received doesn't subtract the amount withdrawn. Your transaction history shows that you're repeatedly sending the funds out and back into your wallet to increase your total received. You're a fake and judging by the way you both think and talk, you're far off intelligent.","lolwhat wrote:You keep calling me all this and that, I'm done with that.
