One example of this would be if you connected to a Starbucks wi-fi in San Francisco one day and used the MAC address 12:34:56. If you travel to Seattle and connect to a Starbucks there using the same MAC address 12:34:56, then Starbucks knows that the same customer was in San Francisco one day and Seattle the next, and can correlate their traffic together to form a better network profile of the customer if they wanted to.  The MAC addr changer that I use on OS X is https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC - it's a command-line python tool that you can install with pip (pip install SpoofMAC).

While drugs will get the biggest share, i am also getting a new laptop, so i want to start fresh. For all my life i've not been so careful, and i paid for it (look at my signiture) and i do deserve it. I am learning from my mistakes, my biggest one was that i used the same VPN ip to access my facebook (by mistake i swear) and even after fb started asking for id i didn't get paranoid enough to format... bam busted (please don't ask for more information). and after that i didn't have access to a pc, so i was using tor on my android for a while now, and now i want to start fresh. I am gonna start hosting hidden services, and go bigger on illegal things, so being busted is no longer an option, and i want to be as safe as possible, and here is my plan which i already started working on, and i want advise and answers to some questions. For my android : I encrypted it all, and i coded an app which does the following : Can be formatted by an sms, in-case it went missing or taken by the police (also it can send location and screenshots, cam shots...etc just in-case). Has 2 passwords, to access the password screen it has to be tilted in a specific sequence, and when this is done, i get a password screen, which if entered the right pass, it unhide the encryption software and start it, which asks for another pass which gives me access to my real stuff. But if the other pass is entered, it silently delete the sensitive data and show a kinky porn folder. If another sim was inserted it sends the data to a trusted friend so he can take action (format if he can't get in touch with me). It has a spy tool, which would've came handy the last time, if a spesific message received, it silently call the sender so he can hear what happens in the room (they keep the phone in the same room where they discuss their evil plans and what evidence they have). that was it for the android, now for the laptop that is gonna come soon this will go : I'll installs whonix or tails (please advise) on a usb stick, and since it will host a hidden service (low traffic) it will be connected 24/7, i have some thermite handy and ready to ignite, so if anything happens while i am in the house i just melt the usb (legal advise needed). It will also be encrypted (duh) and will has a kill switch which can be activated either remotely by my android (really fast one click app) or any device that is connected to the internet (more complicated procedure), and it will automatically format if i was away for more than 2 days (i should enter a password within 48 hours). the problem which i can't figure how to solve is how to completely hide that i use vpn and/or tor from my isp, i should look like a normal citizin, and since i am in a small city where no one uses tor any slip is a disaster. also, trusted vpn providers needed, ones who accept bitcoin and don't keep data, preferrably swedish ones. and i am also planning to plant weed and mushrooms, so i am planning an arduino project which does it usual job of monitoring the tempreture and such, but i am planning to add internet commectivety to it and wire some (explosives/gasoline/advise needed) to burn the thing remotely in-case anything happened, (yes i don't mind burning my whole house to stay away from prison) legal advise needed here.

Now no offence intended but are you sure running a hidden service is a good idea, its quite risky and a hefty sentence can be received I know its tempting I've toyed with it. What encryption program did you use, bits, key strength etc. If you've used a decent encryption setup, strength, protocol,  key etc especially the key your data would be much more secure rather then formating it, you'd be amazed what you can scrub outa formatted phones and tablets it is not a way to reliably securely delete.  As for the laptop, whonix or tails really comes down to personal opinion both are deb based, but are you going to have this lappy on 24/7 to run this site, like tails is good but running it of a usb 24/7 I'm assuming you would have persistence setup, personally not what id use for this situation. Id do a clean install onto the lappy with whonix as is made to run hidden services whereas tails is made as a live OS. The new kali comes with a killswitch/wipe feature but once again ""formating"" isn't to be relied upon especially if you know someone with expensive toys is coming to try and recover info, again full disk encryption with a strong key is the best responce IMHO. Have you thought about a small server they are relatively cheap, just a thought. As for wanton destruction of property I know in my country that's a minimum malicious damage charge even when its your own property look into it where you're from. I use privateinternetaccess for vpn signup through tor using any email tor made or not I've even used disposable emails they only email your password that's it, bitcoins for payment no connection logs or registration logs supposedly never really know till LEO asks for them and up to 5 devices on the account US$7/month. There is no need to hide the vpn from your isp lots of people use rhem and more everyday thanks ro x,y,keystoke etc. But always connect vpn and they'll never know you're using tor.

So they got some of my real deared people there without my permission and told them something similer to what you said. And threatened THEM that ill go to jail at least for 3 days if I didn't speak. They didn't lie. They said that if I spoke ill go to home tonight (which I did) I couldn't call a lawyer and I didn't for the entire time know if I was under arrest or not. Andthey wouldn't unswer. Now even though I prefer to be smacked around a little and sleep 3 days in jail than to confess. Seeing your mother/father/wife...etc crying and actually BEGGING you to say what they want to hear not to se you behind bar ... this I rather confess than see. Those people are dirty. No morals. They go to any lenght to get it done. After all I knew I can say in court that I was threatened (which I did) and the confession was removed. So it was like I never confessed but I paid shitload on the laywee which I could've spare if I didn't confess in the first place (they had close to no evidence) and I knew that the hdd couldn't really incriminate me since I save the very important stuff in my head only.. and again (according to the lawyer) I was right. It depends on where you live... here they are more dirty than you imagine. In the end its all working out (ill be proven innocent) but believe me you think you are amart. they KNOW THAT they will use techniques especially for you. They know all about you. And they know how to play their cards even if they had 7-2  . Anyway... back to the original subject. I am fairly experienced with chemistry.

Then once they find the PD they can look into relavent Police reports on any situation that matches up with yours and BAM they know who Ravingmad is IRL. or at least narrow you down to a number of people they can count on their hands, rather than serveral hundred thousand.  then you can get charged with conspiracy shit I believe.  stating that you wanna start your own hidden service, i saw something about plants(assuming weed) and arsine.    I could be completely wrong but it seems to me I'd rather be wrong and over-cautious than wrong and compromise my Anonimity   ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","JTRS","27132","2014-02-19T08:02:50","How to safely upload product photos?","Discussion/Security","As poster before me mentioned, you have to remove metadata from it. Safest way to do it - by yourself, more effort though. More common way - using a software designed to do that. You can find tons of them around. If possible, use an open source, so you can verify it's quality. As to Tails, well, it's a bit squishy. Not only it's written by unknown people, but it's also at a very early stage, therefore, pretty unstable. Another thing is that it uses Tor for all connections by default, sounds like a safe bet for someone fairly new at technology but in reality it's really not, know a few cases where some people have relied on Tor as their security for high profile attacks and failed miserably. My suggestion would be to use a reliable linux system, modify it to your needs and create your own network infrastructure, and maybe then use Tor as your final layer of protection.",""

If you buy $2-3k of bitcoins every month without an income on the books, you better believe there is the possibility of it being flagged. I'm sure that bitcoin purchases through an exchange are highly scrutinized because the exchanges have to follow the laws. If you had to disclose your identity to the exchange in order to purchase from them, they may do some background checking on you. Now, buying $2-3k of bitcoins every month is still legal, but you better have the income to support these kinds of purchases. If you do have the income, then you should be reporting your gains/losses on your taxes when the time comes. I highly doubt people buying that much in bitcoins just to spend them on drugs are going to be reporting it though. That's a risk, and since the laws have just recently changed we won't know until next year whether people are audited for this or not.

Even though the Tor community has been talking at length about the $3,000 demonstration, no official Tor developer has given comment.The demonstration will cover âthe nature, feasibility, and limitations of possible attacks, and then dive into dozens of successful real-world de-anonymization case studies, ranging from attribution of botnet command and control servers, to drug-trading sites, to users of kiddie porn places,â the presenters say."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jack N Hoff","47410","2014-07-30T19:42:56","Tor security advisory: ""relay early"" traffic confirmation attack","Discussion/Security","They beleive it was the people that were going to present at Black Hat 2014 that carried out this attack.   ","SUMMARY:On July 4 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services. The attack involved modifying Tor protocol headers to do traffic confirmation attacks.The attacking relays joined the network on January 30 2014, and we removed them from the network on July 4. While we don't know when they started doing the attack, users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected.Unfortunately, it's still unclear what ""affected"" includes. We know the attack looked for users who fetched hidden service descriptors, but the attackers likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up). The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service. In theory the attack could also be used to link users to their destinations on normal Tor circuits too, but we found no evidence that the attackers operated any exit relays, making this attack less likely. And finally, we don't know how much data the attackers kept, and due to the way the attack was deployed (more details below), their protocol header modifications might have aided other attackers in deanonymizing users too.Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (0.2.4.23 or 0.2.5.6-alpha), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used â but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem. Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one. Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.THE TECHNICAL DETAILS:We believe they used a combination of two classes of attacks: a traffic confirmation attack and a Sybil attack.A traffic confirmation attack is possible when the attacker controls or observes the relays on both ends of a Tor circuit and then compares traffic timing, volume, or other characteristics to conclude that the two relays are indeed on the same circuit. If the first relay in the circuit (called the ""entry guard"") knows the IP address of the user, and the last relay in the circuit knows the resource or destination she is accessing, then together they can deanonymize her. You can read more about traffic confirmation attacks, including pointers to many research papers, at this blog post from 2009:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enoughThe particular confirmation attack they used was an active attack where the relay on one end injects a signal into the Tor protocol headers, and then the relay on the other end reads the signal. These attacking relays were stable enough to get the HSDir (""suitable for hidden service directory"") and Guard (""suitable for being an entry guard"") consensus flags. Then they injected the signal whenever they were used as a hidden service directory, and looked for an injected signal whenever they were used as an entry guard.The way they injected the signal was by sending sequences of ""relay"" vs ""relay early"" commands down the circuit, to encode the message they want to send. For background, Tor has two types of cells: link cells, which are intended for the adjacent relay in the circuit, and relay cells, which are passed to the other end of the circuit. In 2008 we added a new kind of relay cell, called a ""relay early"" cell, which is used to prevent people from building very long paths in the Tor network. (Very long paths can be used to induce congestion and aid in breaking anonymity). But the fix for infinite-length paths introduced a problem with accessing hidden services, and one of the side effects of our fix for bug 1038 was that while we limit the number of outbound (away from the client) ""relay early"" cells on a circuit, we don't limit the number of inbound (towards the client) relay early cells.So in summary, when Tor clients contacted an attacking relay in its role as a Hidden Service Directory to publish or retrieve a hidden service descriptor (steps 2 and 3 on the hidden service protocol diagrams), that relay would send the hidden service name (encoded as a pattern of relay and relay-early cells) back down the circuit. Other attacking relays, when they get chosen for the first hop of a circuit, would look for inbound relay-early cells (since nobody else sends them) and would thus learn which clients requested information about a hidden service.There are three important points about this attack:A) The attacker encoded the name of the hidden service in the injected signal (as opposed to, say, sending a random number and keeping a local list mapping random number to hidden service name). The encoded signal is encrypted as it is sent over the TLS channel between relays. However, this signal would be easy to read and interpret by anybody who runs a relay and receives the encoded traffic. And we might also worry about a global adversary (e.g. a large intelligence agency) that records Internet traffic at the entry guards and then tries to break Tor's link encryption. The way this attack was performed weakens Tor's anonymity against these other potential attackers too â either while it was happening or after the fact if they have traffic logs. So if the attack was a research project (i.e. not intentionally malicious), it was deployed in an irresponsible way because it puts users at risk indefinitely into the future.(This concern is in addition to the general issue that it's probably unwise from a legal perspective for researchers to attack real users by modifying their traffic on one end and wiretapping it on the other. Tools like Shadow are great for testing Tor research ideas out in the lab.)B) This protocol header signal injection attack is actually pretty neat from a research perspective, in that it's a bit different from previous tagging attacks which targeted the application-level payload. Previous tagging attacks modified the payload at the entry guard, and then looked for a modified payload at the exit relay (which can see the decrypted payload). Those attacks don't work in the other direction (from the exit relay back towards the client), because the payload is still encrypted at the entry guard. But because this new approach modifies (""tags"") the cell headers rather than the payload, every relay in the path can see the tag.C) We should remind readers that while this particular variant of the traffic confirmation attack allows high-confidence and efficient correlation, the general class of passive (statistical) traffic confirmation attacks remains unsolved and would likely have worked just fine here. So the good news is traffic confirmation attacks aren't new or surprising, but the bad news is that they still work. See https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough for more discussion.Then the second class of attack they used, in conjunction with their traffic confirmation attack, was a standard Sybil attack â they signed up around 115 fast non-exit relays, all running on 50.7.0.0/16 or 204.45.0.0/16. Together these relays summed to about 6.4% of the Guard capacity in the network. Then, in part because of our current guard rotation parameters, these relays became entry guards for a significant chunk of users over their five months of operation.We actually noticed these relays when they joined the network, since the DocTor scanner reported them. We considered the set of new relays at the time, and made a decision that it wasn't that large a fraction of the network. It's clear there's room for improvement in terms of how to let the Tor network grow while also ensuring we maintain social connections with the operators of all large groups of relays. (In general having a widely diverse set of relay locations and relay operators, yet not allowing any bad relays in, seems like a hard problem; on the other hand our detection scripts did notice them in this case, so there's hope for a better solution here.)In response, we've taken the following short-term steps:1) Removed the attacking relays from the network.2) Put out a software update for relays to prevent ""relay early"" cells from being used this way.3) Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.4) Clients can tell whether they've received a relay or relay-cell. For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase ""Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell"".The following longer-term research areas remain:5) Further growing the Tor network and diversity of relay operators, which will reduce the impact from an adversary of a given size.6) Exploring better mechanisms, e.g. social connections, to limit the impact from a malicious set of relays. We've also formed a group to pay more attention to suspicious relays in the network:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays7) Further reducing exposure to guards over time, perhaps by extending the guard rotation lifetime:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relayhttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard... Better understanding statistical traffic correlation attacks and whether padding or other approaches can mitigate them.9) Improving the hidden service design, including making it harder for relays serving as hidden service directory points to learn what hidden service address they're handling:https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love;OPEN QUESTIONS:Q1) Was this the Black Hat 2014 talk that got canceled recently?Q2) Did we find all the malicious relays?Q3) Did the malicious relays inject the signal at any points besides the HSDir position?Q4) What data did the attackers keep, and are they going to destroy it? How have they protected the data (if any) while storing it?Great questions. We spent several months trying to extract information from the researchers who were going to give the Black Hat talk, and eventually we did get some hints from them about how ""relay early"" cells could be used for traffic confirmation attacks, which is how we started looking for the attacks in the wild. They haven't answered our emails lately, so we don't know for sure, but it seems likely that the answer to Q1 is ""yes"". In fact, we hope they *were* the ones doing the attacks, since otherwise it means somebody else was. We don't yet know the answers to Q2, Q3, or Q4."

Here's my experience:   We were on a 40min drive on our way back from a friends house after a party (notorious pot head in the area) one evening (three in the car). We noticed after a while this car had been following us on a VERY scenic route back to where we were going (this was odd because nobody uses those roads, especially from where we had just driven that late at night). So... we stopped in at a garage to let them go past us. Turns out it was the fuzz. They parked up next to us and gave us a BS statement about how they were following a ""bunch of youths"" speeding in a car from where we had just driven (we had sight of them all the way)... but they had lost sight of them at some point and assumed we were them. So they said they were going to do checks and search the car (we all had peng on us, there was no getting around the smell). I took the hit for my mate who was driving (it was sat in the glove box so I claimed responsibility) because it was only a small amount and I had a little left on me too (didn't want him to get a ban). My other mate and me went to the police station and got processed.   I don't think most police actually need a genuine excuse to ask for a search. If they suspect something (for us it was probably them seeing us leaving that party that set them off - trying to catch drink drivers) they will find a way and they will be thorough (they were going to bring in sniffers even before they smelled the interior so we just put our hands up). I would suggest not carrying anything on you in a car unless you're driving too.. you're basically at the mercy of whoever is driving and if they're a novice and drive like an idiot that's just another way in for the fuzz.   If you have to though... I would suggest putting it behind some of the removable panels. E.g. in a Fiat Punto there is a panel for the fuses that you can only remove with a screwdriver. I use a 2p coin. My car has been searched since and I've gotten away with it in that place. They asked to search but I said ""and what do you expect me to open it with officer?"".  ",""

","Discussion/Security","I don't know where Tails keeps its keys, but I would think it's in the same place as GPG.  If it is, you can also just copy the file ""$HOME/.gnupg/secring.gpg"" to whatever media you choose.  Stick it in the same place elsewhere or select it manually by importing keys from a file or whatnot and it should work fine.  To my knowledge, they're kept encrypted using your passphrase, so you don't need to encrypt the file if you copy it.  Note though that the email addresses associated with those keys is in plaintext and easily read with any text editor.  Note also that if you encrypt the file, be very careful not to encrypt it using the same key as you normally do.  Why not?  Because you're going to need the private key to decrypt it.  But oh shit, wait, that's the very key that's encrypted and that needs to be decrypted...!

","Discussion/Security"," You can just use gpg.  It'll encrypt a key stored in a file just as well as a message stored in a file.  Pretend the key is your message and do the same thing you always do, BUT like I said, don't encrypt it to your public key (because you won't have the private key elsewhere, that's the whole point of exporting it and all).  Personally what I'd do is encrypt it using only a symmetric cipher.  You can do that with gpg by giving it the ""-c"" command line parameter.  So if your key is pasted into the file ""key.gpg"", you'd type this:  gpg -c key.gpg And then give it some long passphrase or something.  Anything 10 characters or more is probably good, just make sure you remember it.  Then when you want to decrypt the file, just type this:   gpg key.gpg It'll automatically figure out that what you want is to decrypt the file, since the file you're giving it is already encrypted.  It'll also detect the symmetric cipher encryption and how it needs to decrypt it & ask you for the passphrase.  You don't need any keys by doing it this way, all you need is a working copy of the gpg program and that passphrase you used.  Why don't we always do it this way?  It's weaker encryption than we usually use, and it would require that we pass around passwords and stuff anyway.  It's what I do when I'm worried about not having the private key available or something though  ","Quote from: StevieHyperD on November 14, 2013, 08:53:28 pmRemember to encrypt the key on the usb device you put it ontoHow do you do this?

I would not rely on these policies to protect you though because officers are notorious for fabricating probable cause.

Lyman     From Chapter 12, Searching and Seizing Drug Evidence  ","                                            Searching and Seizing Drug EvidenceThe execution of a thorough search of vehicles or premises usually requiresa search warrant issued by a judge or magistrate. Although a suspect maywaive rights and freely consent to a search, in the context of a detailed searchfor illicit drugs, such consent is rarely desirable. In addition, there are legalthird-party consents under certain circumstances, such as where joint controlexists (parentâchild, husbandâwife, cotenants); however, these cases are alsoconsidered exceptional in a detailed search for drugs. Through the authorityof a search warrant, a detailed search of a home or vehicle for drugs willprimarily be conducted.Searching the Suspectâs PremisesIf an arrest and search are planned to take place at the suspectâs home, placeof employment, or other premises, a search warrant should be obtained first.Premises cannot be searched thoroughly incidental to an arrest without asearch warrant. Even though plain-view observations are not consideredsearches and evidence can be seized during an arrest, evidence observed fromplain view cannot be seized and used as legal evidence. It should be notedthat the plain-view doctrine applies only when the discovery of the items tobe seized was inadvertent. It is unlikely that a court would uphold the validityof the plain-view seizure where it occurred incidental to a âtimeâ or pretextarrest. For example, if officers arrest a suspect and then accompany him tohis residence, suggesting that he go to the bedroom and change clothes beforegoing to jail, drugs seized in the bedroom probably would be excluded asevidence. Thus, a valid search warrant is necessary to ensure a detailed searchof the premises.                     If an arrest is made in the building without a search warrant, the officershould adhere to the following guidelines:      â¢   The officer should search the person arrested for weapons and evidence.      â¢   The officer should search the immediate area around the suspect to          prevent his grabbing a weapon or destroying evidence; this area is          generally confined to the reaching distance of the suspect. Once the          prisoner is restrained, the officer can no longer search beyond his          person or the immediate area within which he could lunge and obtain          a weapon.      â¢   The officer may check other rooms and closets or other persons          wanted in connection with the crime, to protect himself from attack,          if possible violence is reasonably suspected.      â¢   The officer can seize evidentiary items, inadvertently discovered, that          are in plain view in the room of the arrest or in other rooms when          searching for the suspect or accomplices at large.      â¢   The officer may not search other rooms and closets for evidence. He          may not rummage through drawers, suitcases, file cabinets, and boxes.          The officer may not enter a backyard garage or the suspectâs car          parked outside.      â¢   The officer should be aware that the compost is in the dwelling.          Although the threatened distraction of evidence by the compost will          enable the police officer to enlarge the scope of the search incident          to an arrest in such a manner or to permit an âevidence we,â where          it is apparent that evidence is actually in the process of distraction or          about to be removed from the jurisdiction, the court has implied that          such a search can be maintained whether or not it was considered          incident to a valid arrest.      â¢   The officer may still obtain a valid consent to search other rooms, the          basement or garage, automobile, and other places; however, it is better          to obtain a search warrant.      â¢   If the suspect is arrested outside of his or her house, the officer may          not go inside the premises for the sole purpose of searching the home.      In the search of a premises with a warrant, the assisting officer should lookfor the items generally described in the warrant. Warrants prepared to discoverillicit drugs frequently use the terms narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia.The following types of items may be seized during the search:           â¢  Contraband â An article the possession of which is the crime itself.       The drugs themselves are contraband.    â¢  Fruits of the crime â Items seized by the criminal. The money       involved in narcotic deals can be the fruits of a crime.    â¢  Instruments of the crime â Items used to commit the crime. In the       case of clandestine laboratories, the equipment itself.    â¢  Evidence â Items that tend to prove that the suspect committed a       crime. Items such as diluents and adulterants, food coloring, balloons,       or similar items can be collected as evidence."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","15854","2014-01-10T07:17:04","[Intel] Searching and Seizing Drug Evidence","Discussion/Legal","continued  ","Dwelling SearchesAssignment of sufficient personnel is a crucial step in conducting a thoroughsearch of the dwelling for drugs. Some officers should be assigned to theexterior of the premises to prevent escape attempts or attempts to discardevidence from the premises. If evidence is thrown out of the window or door,the officer assigned the role of observer has two functions, to identify theindividual discarding the evidence and to secure that evidence. The officerwill have to show where the evidence landed and the window or door fromwhich it was thrown.     The recording officer has an extremely important function during adetailed search for narcotics. His or her main job is to record where and bywhom each piece of evidence is found. Consequently, when he first entersthe area to be searched, he or she should draw a detailed diagram of thepremises. The officer should also ensure that all contraband is initialed asevidence. The evidence should be kept by the recording officer and preservedaccording to departmental regulations and procedures until it is turned overto the laboratory for analysis or introduced as evidence in court. Because ofthese functions, the recording officer should be selected on the basis of hisor her ability to testify effectively, since this officer will testify extensivelyduring the trial.     Once inside the area to be searched, all individuals found on the premisesshould be brought into one room so that the recording officer can take downinformation from each person. Each individual should be listed according tothe room in which he was found, since evidence may later be found in thoserooms and various individuals may then be charged with possession. Officersshould observe individuals for symptoms of drug abuse. Indications that theindividual is presently under the influence of narcotics may provide probablecause for a personal search.     If enough officers are available, officers should be paired to search eachroom. The room should be divided equally between the officers. When theofficers have completed their assigned area, they should switch so that eacharea is searched twice, each time by a different officer. Even when only oneofficer is assigned to a room, he should switch with another officer in anotherroom. Although the officers may use the same pattern of search, the secondsearch may reveal something previously overlooked.     To conduct the search, the officer should begin at one wall and searcheverything that rests against or is hung on that wall and then proceed aroundthe room. Lights and outlets should be examined carefully. If paint on thescrews or around the plate is broken, the plate should be removed and theinside area searched. The border around the door should be studied for signsof stress since it may be shielding a hollow portion behind. The top of thedoor and door frames should be checked for indentations. A plug in the topof the door may hide a secret compartment, as do many door hinges. Plasterwalls should be felt for raised areas indicating that they have been plasteredover numerous times.     Wall pictures should be taken down and searched thoroughly since contra-band can be hidden between the layers of glass, and the picture itself, or in theframe and paper backing. Similarly, the backs of stereo equipment and otherelectronic equipment should be removed and the interior examined. The topand bottom of venetian blinds should be removed and checked. Curtainsshould be felt from top to bottom, including seams, hems, and linings.     After the officer has searched the walls and related items, he should moveto the center of the room and begin with furniture. Upholstered couches orchairs should be turned upside down and the bottom examined to ensure thatthe staples are intact and the material protecting the bottom of the couchesare the same throughout. A flashlight held close to the material will allow theofficer to see whether anything is taped to the springs. Zippered cushionsshould be taken apart and felt by hand. Telephones should be examinedthoroughly, both inside and out. Light shades and bulbs should be removedfrom their sockets and examined. Rugs should be carefully rolled up. Plantersand flower pots should also be examined. The outside of windows should bechecked for hanging items. The search team should be especially thorough insearching bathrooms, seemingly a popular room in which to hide drugs. Insearching a bathroom, the officer should look for false bottoms on laundrybaskets and under sinks and for watertight containers inside flush tanks.     Prescription medicine bottles should be carefully examined; their truecontent should never be taken for granted. If the searching officer believesthat there is something amiss with the prescription bottles, such as a greatnumber of bottles or labels made out to people not living in the premises, heshould seize all the prescription bottles and mark them as evidence. However,he should ask the suspect what prescription medicines are needed and at whattime he or she will need the next dose. The officer should contact the doctoror pharmacist whose name appears on the label to verify the prescription.Moreover, all pills and tablets should be compared with a Physicianâs DeskReference or similar source to ensure that the found drugs correspond to theprescription.     When an officer finds evidence, he should temporarily halt his search,call the recording officer, initial the evidence, turn it over to the recordingofficer, and then continue to search. In this manner, there are at least twoofficers witnessing the recovery of the drugs, and most likely only the record-ing officer will need to testify in court about the discovery. Officers mustavoid the tendency to stop searching as soon as they find some contraband;people involved in drugs frequently hide the contraband in several differentlocations. It is the officerâs function to find all of these hiding places.     All valuables found on the premises should be safeguarded if necessary,and a receipt should be given to the owner for all items removed from thelocation. Generally, a list of items taken is written on the suspectâs copy ofthe search warrant and serves as a receipt. Because it may be necessary toremove molding, baseboards, panels, and other fixtures of a home, all damagedone to personal property should be listed and photographed. Before rippingup floorboards or breaking into walls, the officer must establish good reasonsfor his actions. Ideally, the witness or informant will provide positive infor-mation regarding evidence hidden in these areas. Other signs would beindentations, marks, or scratches that make it apparent that the section hadbeen previously removed.     If large sums of money are found, this fact should be reported to theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) so that an investigation can be conducted as toits source. Such an investigation may lead to tax evasion charges and in additionfacilitate the narcotics investigation. IRS investigations follow the trail of moneythat narcotics trafficking invariably leaves behind. Financial evidence of drugdealing enhances the chance for successful criminal prosecution.     As part of the search operation of a dwelling, officers should be alert forany intelligence information, such as telephone and address books, if they canbe seized as evidence. This information should be jotted down in a mannerthat will not be noticed by suspects. Otherwise, the value of this intelligenceinformation might be compromised at a later time.     If suspects have automobiles in the vicinity of the search scene, probablecause developed from questioning may be sufficient to obtain a searchwarrant for these vehicles. An officer can stay with the suspectâs vehicle toprevent its removal while a search warrant is obtained. One of the functionsof the recording officer is to obtain information from individuals presentat the scene; however, if the recording officer becomes too involved inrecording discovered evidence, additional officers should be assigned thetask of obtaining information from the individuals. Regardless of quantityor variety, however, the actual custody of all evidence remains the responsi-bility of the recording officer."

Even the propertyitself does not have to be âparticularly described,â as it does when obtaining asearch warrant. The temporal duration and spatial scope of the consent searchmay be limited by the individual furnishing the consent, and the police officermay not search areas where consent to search has been withheld. The natureor object of the consent searches is not limited, however, and the officer doesnot need to look for any particular kind of item, such as drugs only.     A consent search may be valid regardless of whether the subject givingconsent had a right to refuse consent. The Supreme Court has noted thatâwhile knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor to be taken intoaccount, the government need not establish such knowledge as the sine quanon of an effective consent.â A consent to search will be valid only where it wasvoluntarily given, and the courts will refer to the âtotality of the circumstancesâto determine whether the consent was voluntary. If the court could find thatthe consent was âthe product of coercion, express or implied,â it is likely thatthe search will be invalidated and its fruits suppressed.     Many courts have indicated that the state must satisfy a more rigorousburden in demonstrating voluntariness or lack of coercion where the individualfurnishing his consent is in custody or in such situation where arrest is immi-nent. Factors such as these, along with others such as whether probable causefor the search existed initially, are often considered by the courts as elementsof the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether consent to search wasvoluntarily furnished, although alone they are not ordinarily determinative.Other circumstances that could rule against a finding that consent had beenvoluntarily given might include:     â¢  The presence of the arresteeâs family, friends, or employer (implied        psychological coercion).     â¢  The display of weapons or the use of restraints.     â¢  The time of night.     â¢  The number of officers present.     â¢  The aggressiveness of the officer.     â¢  Trickery or misrepresentation used in obtaining consent.     â¢  Interrogation, when aimed at obtaining consent and conducted        without giving the suspect Miranda warnings or when the question-        ing following the advice of Miranda rights is so intensive as to        compulsively induce the consent.     â¢  Threats to obtain the search warrant or to impound his vehicle."

This is how it works, try this at home with your own PGP key on a test message to see for yourself.  Example:  This is a PGP ciphertext encrypted to myself using the PGP Club public key.  -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  hQGMA7pmVyGp4Z9uAQv/Y7fCVqUChMnji1g4Tm4zirTSoBvzoaoB8pmshcFVFYMh Mx0W8fKVrMOU/TxzSjIhaUvVmxRTAF4MxMNrLg7ncTBWVDeBjrOQCNYUMCrGt//d 0u/HqWn6EfUCADuaxLd52WmF1CIs2ezXJo6XXfwfJCStiel0tek0vpKINlllXwlx YdgvUZKB3BpE3K2abNfSkaeBHlPvRgUGWI+VAkNpwsNq+y1RXOIVyC0p38Rcpxuv Bp6iMKoxE30SPOVzYR29bCA8I/+/sRvlOSDTKnDEkiFl7/rezheBJT2+OiJlOIkx 6wTv1HSeWNtrH9jnOGfGUKUgId0eEyKUgnHh1Z9IJlMqnvCNIUreTuylI4/v0izh 5oqA6dHO7S2YPrm1TtDnihBsVrexq6/fv0mBApTR9LChP/0pkDHVKdfkuoUYXjg2 E30Je4iyPSnfD1J597/Aqvv+cOlj5JyAkQ2vFnywYw5s6O/DB93h2jz4XU8KYZmZ 3+slR6o1wV/kDEKg/iFe0lIBdHmum3nEzfSN8kFqRAT/1sMyDBPPs7g7phNPe7lP NACp4iUHdca8n419dDFDCoqJIXeM4gYqaj5njVvETt73car1l/p/h/GMKptK+CH/ nzlv =tTJA -----END PGP MESSAGE-----  If you store this as a text file such as encrypted_msg.asc somewhere, and then open the terminal/command line and type this code:  gpg -v encrypted_msg.asc  The result is this information:  gpg: public key is A9E19F6E gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID A9E19F6E  A9E19F6E is the key ID for my public key.  Of course, normally we do not encrypt messages using our own public keys. But there are possible negative consequences for anonymity due to this feature of PGP.  --  Many PGP or GPG software products (most Macintosh software appears to be setup this way for example) automatically encrypt a message to yourself as well as the other person you're sending the message to. So if anybody knows an association between you and your public key e.g. you uploaded it to a key server, or you use the same PGP key for both life inside and outside of SR, then if they intercept your message they'll know it is from you. They won't know what is inside the message, but they'll know it is you who sent it. Not good.  The point is that you really want 1 PGP key for SR, and only SR. Never use that key anywhere else otherwise you'll be linkable between those two places.  Note: One thing that can catch people out is signing. Unless you sign a public key locally, the signature will be uploaded to a keyserver automatically as part of a Web of Trust deal. This is pretty standard among most PGP/GPG software. So, if you are signing people's public keys, ensure you only do this locally. There is an option for this. Otherwise you can be hypothetically traced back from the keyserver. Yes, you could Torify your GPG client, but that's a whole other discussion.  --  Finally, consider that if a message is encrypted to somebody else's public key, that if the Feds know the source of the message, then they have evidence for a connection between you and that person. Sometimes that is all that is required.  -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  hQGMA7pmVyGp4Z9uAQv9EvfKCl1k8lEDcfgQNR7t/iNg1RaGaQyEShmfgBFkFVWx r4wjOTxo2Pl5I826Rhzv8axbSom/+K41WRRV38LiHT65RNrPQmyozV/vWOmo18eE coXqdBzmuOIVbqUkd/oV0bgSxESmbSVc/cTmXDrniZZ/svcD+jbd+oSUCl8yp4U7 xor7ojdpAcL5QFPz8jy7sDU/+7fsDCsgoHW8OTPwcrPckqpFJUZFJd7/9qbbwdE6 BuyJYDmvFgqQAjB8qecYcpzUMzQzvYEbzMP1QHZ1XaAPIy2mB2FYXF44Am4JNgXY sA7/FG27CPwd9RkxzPQrldMMgZuhs8x8/vVGxf7/tUusrQrSCMHnlRKE95vT5ffY f2NsDvs24dOLZjCx2jfrr9W1MREUkja0wZPWaIjzhjAuKTaPWRQFWFVjOzacz3ca 6EYEzWFO09VRvb3RBBNIXJcJCM1HdfVcNtGSj7gspSlr1YWJSA1WuMmHzhy4KWNH nfGUzY/8rAzinhT3AG9jhQEMA5jmn5iuBkvEAQf/b6ZunD7Sfwu+N2UEujF2WQGk QsOfzAoy4bMSEt5l7bLLXzvjtsvCPWQIlbxQO2qZqUucGKH/rBwmakPtFoqNo03S d/FCJts8Wtrxd5QNV8GhYSn3+fij6MHIkG2GjCSL344CAR/NQakQhEyvDPJNBUhH Gmns7grYQXAWoG0ClIHrYIkFIH6L2pMvUBxfGXN2Hq2MiG735CLbKnT8aIUhIDib /b4SFQ74LqV5L7E5g9P5e7iX/95Cro+SYCkAchpXtJlqtTscWBXWC426bW+3Q2rP bPzLpageTiDiqGJJgWb8LzI2Zp3hKNbqLYm5vvSqfQAnh53K1Q0P6ZaDKPvKYtJL AXidPBUIYvzDpC3N/8mdM4GRXOenVeXVGc9SBfxcyoYxis4syC9UcQ7Regl7m7Si lpOVHOnHR1mPMwiZbJxas1WBQWqcTTb7UUA4 =D12u -----END PGP MESSAGE-----  The above message is encrypted to my public key and some random member of Club PGP.

Anonymity all around.  As I said, there is a caveat. It's that to decrypt the message, GPG or PGP will have to try every single private key in your keychain (or the recipient's keychain), which appears alarming at first due to a dozen or so password requests, and then just plain annoying. But that is a small inconvenience really, unless you have a lot of private keys on your keychain, which to be honest you shouldn't, I would recommend you keep your PGP SR key all by its lonesome and use an entirely different copy of GPG for work/other purposes. Having a portable copy of GPG for a memory stick is a good way to achieve that. Then fat finger errors are not possible, like encrypting with your SR public key as well as to your boss, with your PGP public key up on SR for all to see.  Finally if you don't want to use the gpg.conf file (good for setting up long term, consistent, default options) I do believe you can use throw-keyids and hidden-encrypt-to statements as flags on the command line/terminal so they are invoked only for the encryption of specific messages.

Nonetheless, it is important that when you do get arrested (and everyone should be ready for it    ), everything is going in your favor.  Having a clean record of activity on your computer is vital, so thanks for the info pine.  I wasn't aware that you could trace who encrypted a message. ---------------------------------------------- astor      Hero Member     *****     Posts: 3140     Karma: +640/-238     [thank] [discourage]         View Profile         Personal Message (Offline)  Re: Things About PGP You May Not Know: Your Ciphertext Can Identify You, Friends. Â« Reply #17 on: March 25, 2013, 02:27 am Â»      Quote  Anonymizing the key IDs doesn't offer extra protection in some cases. For example, if you send a message to a vendor, or an email to someone on TorMail, anyone with access to the SR or TorMail servers knows who the recipient is, so there's no reason to hide the key IDs from them.  However, I can think of cases where it is useful. A vendor may want to send an encrypted announcement to several customers, but he doesn't want them to know who the others are. That's as much for their protection as his. The recipients would only be able to deduce the number of other recipients, but they couldn't compare the key IDs to people in their key chain.  Another example is if someone gains access to your computer, but not your TorMail account. Let's say you saved encrypted messages in a text file, as a back up. Then the attacker would only know how many messages you sent, but not who the recipients are.  BTW, if you think you can only be charged for physical drugs in your possession, you should review the Farmers Market case. They were charged for a lot of shit that they talked about in their Hushmail accounts, and that was the only evidence of those crimes.

I don't think there ever can be the degree of customization command line flags and argument's afford a linux user.  If there's anything you can do to alter your completely packaged GUI Mac program you'll just have to go hunting through it's settings and whatnot and hope the app you're using is either highly customizable or can be accessed to append flags and argument's to the app's configuration files.  That's why Linux is superior to all other OS's (cept UNIX from which it came, but the number of distro's and open community openness of linux makes it a better operating system then UNIX).  If you're interested in taking these ultra steps with GPG (what they've suggested isn't REQUIRED, but they're definitely nice way's of covering your tracks).  If you want to use tor on linux I suggest you go download Liberte (believe it's based off of Debian Linux) or Tails (dunno what distro it uses ... Fedora?)    Oh and thanks Pine and Astor.  I was never aware that it was that easy to obtain the public key ID used to encrypt a msg.  I'm definitely a noob when it comes to GPG and know the basics + a tiny bit more.  Given it's simplicity to do though I might have to take your advice into consideration on some msgs.  I thought I was a weirdo hyper paranoid hypocrit because i've always kept my ONE AND ONLY key in one place and would alway's use another instance of GPG with my keychain (I keep it small, moreso actually to remember the really good vendor's i've worked with).  But you just put my mind at ease, now i'm just a weirdo hyper paranoid ... human being, no more hypocrisy !

Here's what the decryption process looks like, along with the processing time:   $ time gpg -d anon_message.pgp gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [REDACTED] ... gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [REDACTED] ... gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [REDACTED] ... gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [REDACTED] ... gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [REDACTED] ... gpg: okay, we are the anonymous recipient. gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000 gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000 gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000  It worked!  real   0m0.513s user 0m0.508s sys   0m0.004s   So, half a second in this case. It will take less time if the message has been decrypted with fewer keys, or you have fewer private keys to test, or it hits a match sooner.   Quote from: Oompaloompa on March 25, 2013, 10:47 pm      Is there a way to get 2 without 1? I'm not keen on the ability to decrypt messages I encrypt to others.   If you don't encrypt the message with your key, then your key ID won't be in it. 2 is automatic without 1.   Quote from: Oompaloompa on March 25, 2013, 10:47 pm      This may be a silly question astor but what's the difference between the version, greeting & comments.     All I can see that would fit the bill is     Quote          Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)      but that's just one line, the version. What is the comments & greeting line?   Comments are just that, you can make a comment about the message, yourself, whatever, but they are usually used to advertise for the PGP program, like this:  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org   The greeting is a splash screen with copyright info that looks like this:  gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.11 Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

I was convinced that pine and LC knew each other in real life, because they both disappeared around the same time and showed up on the same night, months later. I was not the only one who noticed this coincidence. It looked like they planned it. Also, the sexual tension in the ""LC is LE"" thread is unmistakable.    Since then it's pretty much been proven to me that they don't know each other. And no, I never thought you were LC either.

In the link to your post, the person thought you needed his key to decrypt a PGP message that was only encrypted to you (as far as I know), which is not what my question was about.   Ah! Now I understand how you made that mistake, yes, that makes perfect sense.  This is actually a very interesting thing. To understand it you need to know a little more about PGP. Here is how it works:  Normally, Alice encrypts to Bob's public key. Only Bob can read it.  So what is happening with encrypted messages to multiple recipients?  It turns out Pine is lying a bit by telling you guys that PGP is for encryption. Well, it is used for that, but it's far from the whole story. What is really happening is that PGP is a hybrid cryptosystem. It is composed of several parts, not just an encryption algorithm. If it were just an encryption algorithm we wouldn't be able to do a fraction of the things we do with it.  When you encrypt a message with PGP, your message is encrypted using a symmetric block cipher, something like AES. This is very fast and very secure. If we used a public key algorithm such as RSA then it would take considerably longer to encrypt and decrypt data.  However, we cannot send a symmetric key over the internets. If we did that, we wave the protection of encryption goodbye. So we encrypt the symmetric key (called a session key) with RSA, an asymmetric public key algorithm. A symmetric key is tiny, so this is much less data to encrypt than a typical message, and so it happens all in good time.  Then, the symmetrically encrypted data and the asymmetrically encrypted session key are bundled into what we're calling a PGP message.  At arrival, the encrypted session key is decrypted via the magic of public key cryptography. The decrypted symmetric session key is then used to decrypt the main body of the message. Results!  Now for the clever part. In order to encrypt to multiple recpients, you only need to encrypt the message 1 time with the session key. You then encrypt the session key, a tiny amount of information, to each recipient's public key individually. If you encrypted to a 1000 people, then there are 1000 encrypted session keys in the PGP message (and it looks a good bit larger!). This way, everybody can decrypt it, and it doesn't matter whether it's 1 kilobyte or 1 terabyte of data.    ---------------------------------------------- ",""

It should be under ""~/.gnupg/gpg.conf"". This is an address, you need it (without quotations) to find the file but since you're using OSX, you'll need extra steps to find the address bar.  http://superuser.com/questions/174297/how-can-i-get-an-address-bar-in-finder  Read that, find one of their solutions and then copy paste that line into your address bar and it should take you to the folder in which the gpg.conf file is located in.  If you choose to navigate to the file through the GUI manually, then you'll need to turn on the Show Hidden Files option in Mac, wherever that is. The ~ character is whatever your home directory is e.g. if your account is called ""geezy"" then the ""geezy"" directory is the home directory.  Macs are perfectly easy to use until you want to do something Steve Jobs himself didn't think of personally.  Quote from: astor on March 25, 2013, 02:27 am      Anonymizing the key IDs doesn't offer extra protection in some cases. For example, if you send a message to a vendor, or an email to someone on TorMail, anyone with access to the SR or TorMail servers knows who the recipient is, so there's no reason to hide the key IDs from them.   Yes, it very much depends on your use of this feature.  To newbs: If I wrote down an encrypted message using throw-key-ids, put it into a letter and posted it to a friend with his address on the front of the envelope and mine on the back of it, then using throw-key-ids to prevent traffic analysis would be somewhat pointless. However, if I wrote a message using a one time account on SR, then you would successfully be able to communicate without revealing your (SR) identity to traffic analysis if LE hack the server. You'd use a new account per instance of a two way chat communication. Although this sounds like work, it's probably worth the trouble for very important communications. That way only the compromise of the recipient can possibly leak information about the sender. You'd have to mix up what algorithms and key lengths you were using as well for each new public key, since throw-key-ids doesn't get rid of that information (persistently using the same settings for each key would be a giveaway).  The reason why I mention server hacking is important: nobody should assume that their messages will be 'hidden' unless they are encrypted. If you were ordering a large amount from a vendor, you almost certainly should be using such methods as these. If a vendor doesn't 'get' it, find one that does.  Encryption can do more than merely hide your messages, if used properly it can also make it impossible to associate any identity with transmission importance within the network. That is the death knell for LE teams, there is then no earthly way to prioritize their pattern analysis algorithms beyond wild guesswork. They spend a great deal of time building a ""Who's Who"" of Darknet participants and they'll be infuriated if lots of people start adopting practices which remove PGP key ID information out of existence.  Another good use of this feature is when using anonymous remailers (for the final message the sender receives). This is a network of email servers that serves to send anonymous email, a sort of pre-Tor anonymity project for email.  Quote from: quinone on March 25, 2013, 06:19 am      I thought I was a weirdo hyper paranoid hypocrit because i've always kept my ONE AND ONLY key in one place and would alway's use another instance of GPG with my keychain (I keep it small, moreso actually to remember the really good vendor's i've worked with).  But you just put my mind at ease, now i'm just a weirdo hyper paranoid ... human being, no more hypocrisy !   It's good to pay attention to your instincts, they are there for a reason.  Quote from: NW Nugz on March 25, 2013, 07:10 pm      Seems to me we need to have privacy-enabled version of software we can get that is already set up with the changes suggested in the OPs as defaults rather than options. Or, a handy user interface with buttons to push to implement these changes. Maybe sell the software on SR ? :-)   I think so too. Although selling the software would be impossible. APG (anonPG) or something. It could have a list of requirements like:  1. The inability to communicate with keyservers. Or route all such traffic via Tor with explanatory warnings. 2. Puts public keys you haven't used into a password protected encrypted volume after 30 days of non-use. 3. Transparent way to encrypt anonymously for you, and another option for your recipient 4. No meta data within the PGP headers. 5. 8912 bit available as standard. 6. Open source for code inspection. (hence the difficulty of selling it) 7. Steganography options for embedding message into audio, video, images etc. 8. Ability to setup anonymous remailers with ease. 9. Self destruct feature.  I'm sure you guys can think of lots of other things. Simply making it obvious what is what would lift a huge burden on the amount you have to know before you're doing what you want to be doing. Some of it sounds like heavy lifting like the steg and remailers, but actually most of this already exists in the form of open source projects, it's mostly a matter of building a clever GUI to let people access the power of such tools. I don't have the time for it, but it'd make a great project for somebody. ---------------------------------------------- SelfSovereignty      Hero Member     *****     Posts: 2319     Karma: +244/-86     [thank] [discourage]     Just call me SS, it's easier than spelling it out.         View Profile         Metasilk page         Personal Message (Offline)  Re: Things About PGP You May Not Know: Your Ciphertext Can Identify You, Friends.

I mean even some of our punctuation is almost identical.  And I released a program as well, and popped up about a month after that whole affair.  Frankly, Pine, I'm a little surprised that you haven't mentioned any suspicions about me being the same person as him and just coming back to try again or something.  Honestly I only mention it because it really does seem plausible.  I mean I'm certainly not him and didn't even know he existed, but after looking him up I'm a little surprised that not a single person has even mentioned it. ---------------------------------------------- ",""

If you encrypt to 3 people, copy paste the result into a plaintext file.  Now encrypt individually to 3 people. Copy paste and append the results together into a different plaintext file.  Now compare the lengths. Even though it is the same information, it is clear that the first plaintext file is much shorter than the second one.  Compression can only account for so much since ciphertexts are intended to look as much as possible like random noise to prevent cryptanalysis.

If you use ""hidden-encrypt-to"" however, won't the recipient need your public key to decrypt your message?               No. Because that is not how public key cryptography works.              Here is a link to a post I made to a fellow who made an identical mistake to yours:              http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.msg1131314#msg1131314          I would've thought so since you also encrypt the message to yourself when using the ""hidden-encrypt-to [your key]"". I wasn't aware you could encrypt a message to different people at the same time and that they could decrypt it without the others' keys. In the link to your post, the person thought you needed his key to decrypt a PGP message that was only encrypted to you (as far as I know), which is not what my question was about.       Ah! Now I understand how you made that mistake, yes, that makes perfect sense.      This is actually a very interesting thing. To understand it you need to know a little more about PGP. Here is how it works:      Normally, Alice encrypts to Bob's public key. Only Bob can read it.      So what is happening with encrypted messages to multiple recipients?      It turns out Pine is lying a bit by telling you guys that PGP is for encryption. Well, it is used for that, but it's far from the whole story. What is really happening is that PGP is a hybrid cryptosystem. It is composed of several parts, not just an encryption algorithm. If it were just an encryption algorithm we wouldn't be able to do a fraction of the things we do with it.      When you encrypt a message with PGP, your message is encrypted using a symmetric block cipher, something like AES. This is very fast and very secure. If we used a public key algorithm such as RSA then it would take considerably longer to encrypt and decrypt data.      However, we cannot send a symmetric key over the internets. If we did that, we wave the protection of encryption goodbye. So we encrypt the symmetric key (called a session key) with RSA, an asymmetric public key algorithm. A symmetric key is tiny, so this is much less data to encrypt than a typical message, and so it happens all in good time.      Then, the symmetrically encrypted data and the asymmetrically encrypted session key are bundled into what we're calling a PGP message.      At arrival, the encrypted session key is decrypted via the magic of public key cryptography. The decrypted symmetric session key is then used to decrypt the main body of the message. Results!      Now for the clever part. In order to encrypt to multiple recpients, you only need to encrypt the message 1 time with the session key. You then encrypt the session key, a tiny amount of information, to each recipient's public key individually. If you encrypted to a 1000 people, then there are 1000 encrypted session keys in the PGP message (and it looks a good bit larger!). This way, everybody can decrypt it, and it doesn't matter whether it's 1 kilobyte or 1 terabyte of data.  Wow PGP is a lot more complicated than I thought! But why can we send symmetric keys over teh internetz? How would that compromise the encryption? SSL is encrypted using AES so if it wasn't secure over the internet, why would we use it? Thanks for this great explanation! ---------------------------------------------- kmfkewm      Hero Member     *****     Posts: 3833     Karma: +430/-263     [thank] [discourage]         View Profile         Personal Message (Offline)  Re: Things About PGP You May Not Know: Your Ciphertext Can Identify You, Friends. Â« Reply #47 on: May 19, 2013, 06:29 pm Â»      Quote  SSL/TLS session keys are negotiated with asymmetric cryptography, usually RSA or ECDH. You pretty much never use a symmetric algorithm for multi-party communications without also using a key exchange algorithm (or without sharing an original key face to face at least). Usually the only time you use symmetric algorithms alone is for  encrypted data storage like FDE or Truecrypt containers.

Never use that key anywhere else otherwise you'll be linkable between those two places.   Pine, I understand what you're saying here, and I by no means claim to have known what you have presented here previously, but wasn't this fact just understood already? Even without all of this ""ciphertext"" business, couldn't one identify someone just via the name on the PGP key? I mean, most will put their username on their PGP key, to my knowledge, because it makes it easier for one with a large keyring to identify them (I believe you've brought this up before as well). Plus, just based on the basic rules of SR, you don't associate anything you do here with your real life identity. Thank you, however, for going more into detail on this. It definitely bolsters our safety ideology here on SR. ---------------------------------------------- hitit      Jr. Member     **     Posts: 65     Karma: +0/-0     [thank] [discourage]     Peace, Love and Positivity         View Profile         Personal Message (Offline)  Re: Things About PGP You May Not Know: Your Ciphertext Can Identify You, Friends.

We don't use a web of trust here, so it's irrelevant. You have no need to re-import a key multiple times, as none of them are signed, and signing them yourself is a useless chore. The whole key signing mechanism can and should be ignored with trust-model always.  Quote      That affects the cli arguments, not the message body.

Because, as I stated, the vast majority of PGP programs don't use it. Blame their developers.

I don't know if some GPG programs don't use it or not, but if they don't it is a security flaw on their end.  Okay just looked up MDC  Quote      A modification detection code (MDC) is a message digest that can prove the integ-     rity of the message. A message authentication code (MAC) ensures the integrity of     the message and the data origin authentication. The difference between an MDC     and a MAC is that the second includes a secret between Alice and Bob.   So pretty much the MDC is to make sure that the ciphertext is not modified in such a way that the plaintext changes. All in all I don't think it is a huge threat but MDC detects it.  It is probably something like hashing the plaintext message and then concatenating the hash to the plaintext prior to encryption, and during decryption removing the hash then hashing the plaintext and comparing the hash to the concatenated hash. ---------------------------------------------- kmfkewm      Hero Member     *****     Posts: 3833     Karma: +430/-263     [thank] [discourage]         View Profile         Personal Message (Offline)  Re: Things About PGP You May Not Know: Your Ciphertext Can Identify You, Friends.

Bitcoin is here to stay, for sure!!!  ""It's not actually a pump n dump at all, it's China! They can't get enough of Bitcoin right now, and the big problem is, there isn't enough to go around, because everyone is holding. If you look at the volumes back in April when the price spiked, the volume was almost 2.5 million coins, now it's under 500,000! In my opinion, the only thing this time around that could cause a crash would be a serious flaw in the structure of Bitcoin. Right now, there are so many people that want to get in, as soon as the price starts to slide, all the cheap coins will be scooped up, causing the price to just go right back up, and even higher each time.  The train has left the station, and the brakes have just failed, to the moon!!  "" ",""

On the other hand, if vendors enter a BTC price for their product then this is fixed and will only make the product more expensive."

I follow your predictions whenever you make them, Jack.. And you've been right a few times. So, I thought I'd ask - when do you expect a crash? I personally don't see one coming till a couple days after purchases are allowed on the site for some reason.Probably at least two weeks.  Many new users have become aware of bitcoin in the western world and are trying to get money into it right now but are jumping through hoops getting verified and then waiting on deposits and such.  We have not even seen their money enter yet.  It will continue to rise.  Once it comes down very hard the noobs, rookies and weak hands will sell sell sell causing a further crash.  Smart people will buy buy buy those cheap coins when that happens bringing the price up from the heavy crash and it will kind of stabilize.  It will be much lower than it was at the peak but much much higher than we are used it.  It will climb slowly.  People in China will continue to buy bitcoins.

If the cops run in your home, is it easier to just rip out a USB and even smash it if you have time. If it is encrypted, good luck getting anything off of it. Maybe if it is even small enough you could swallow the flash drive if you can handle that.  If you have an encrypted hard drive it is way harder to deal with when you have 10 seconds to react from your door being booted open since the decryption key for your hard drive may remain in ram depending on your computer.   Plus running in a Virtual Machine reduces the risk of malware being able to break out of the box rather than running Tor directly on your computer.   Finally the Virtual Box option is something I offer to newbies who are having a hard time migrating from Windows to Linux. It gives them the option to switch back and forth. While not optimal, it is a step in the right direction.  You cannot teach someone who has just started crawling to start sprinting with Linux right away. It takes time to transition and I am attempting to make that transition easier for the beginners, hence my tutorials.","What kind of security advice is running VirtualBox?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Baraka","47187","2014-07-30T05:38:07","Preferred VPN Service","Discussion/Security","A lot of good comments here. The only real advantage to running Tor over VPN is that your ISP won't know that you're using Tor. Which is a REALLY good thing considering that something like 1 out of 100K people use it. Read: you stick out a lot worse than a sore thumb and your ISP may very well keep track of who's using it. Otherwise from an LE perspective if they really want to nail you a VPN can't offer you true anonymity. Just security. The kicker is that even if the VPN doesn't log and refuses to cooperate the datacenter hosting them probably will. Or the next hop down the line. You can't hide.  Tor is your only real guarantee of anonymity and even that's in question these days with the number of entry and exit nodes the government has on the network. Accessing a hidden service as opposed to browsing clearnet with Tor is your best bet. A premium VPN is a good addition to conceal your use of Tor from your ISP. Or you can use VPN over Tor instead which would conceal your Tor usage from your VPN but not from your ISP. I like the former better even though security expert The Grugq recommends either Tor by itself or VPN over Tor. Search for him. He has a blog and vids on Youtube.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Headhunter","28870","2014-02-25T08:30:21","* * * 'Pony' botnet steals bitcoins, digital currencies * * *","Discussion/Security","Here is a copy of the report from Reuters:  BOSTON (Reuters) - Cyber criminals have infected hundreds of thousands of computers with a virus called ""Pony"" to steal bitcoins and other digital currencies, in the most ambitious cyber attack on virtual money uncovered so far, according to security firm Trustwave.  Trustwave said on Monday that it has found evidence that the operators of a cybercrime ring known as the Pony botnet have stolen some 85 virtual ""wallets"" that contained bitcoins and other types of digital currencies. The firm said it did not know how much digital currency was contained in the wallets.  ""It is the first time we saw such a widespread presence of this type of malware. It was on hundreds of thousands of machines,"" said Ziv Mador, security research director with Chicago-based Trustwave.  Trustwave said it believes the crime ring is still operating, though it does not know who is running the group. The company said it has disrupted the servers that were controlling machines infected with Pony, but expects the group to launch more attacks on virtual currency users.  A representative for the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group that promotes adoption of the virtual currency, advised bitcoin users to store their currency offline in a secure location to prevent cyber criminals from stealing them.  ""Electronic wallet security continues to improve by leaps and bounds as hardware wallets become available and we start to see software wallets that support multi-signature transactions,"" said the Bitcoin Foundation's director of public affairs, Jinyoung Lee Englund.  Trustwave's discovery comes after an unrelated cyber attack that spammed bitcoin exchanges earlier this month. That attack prompted at least three online virtual currency traders to halt withdrawals, causing bitcoin's value to plunge 33 percent over three weeks.  Bitcoin is a digital currency sustained by software code written by an unknown programmer or group of programmers. It is not governed by any one company or person, and its value is determined by user demand.  People who buy digital currency can store it in virtual wallets on their own machines or with companies that offer storage and security services.  Mador said digital currency theft is still in its infancy, but that it is likely to grow. He said that digital currency buyers can protect themselves from hackers by using encrypted files.  ""Most websites don't encrypt them by default, but you can turn them on,"" he added.  NEW OPPORTUNITY  Botnets are collections of infected computers that take orders from central ""command and control"" servers. The botnets steal data from compromised PCs and can also deliver other types of malware that force them to perform tasks.  This is at least the third type of fraud to surface involving digital currencies. Criminals have previously hacked into marketplaces where digital currencies are traded by exploiting security flaws in those sites, then stealing those currencies, according to Trustwave.   ####CLEARNET WARNING####  (http://bit.ly/1hphzRj)  ####CLEARNET WARNING####  Cyber criminals have also developed botnets that force enslaved computers to create, or ""mine"", digital currencies, which the fraudsters then claim as their own.  Bitcoin mining is a time-consuming process in which computers perform complex math calculations. The operators of those botnets are stealing electricity and data centre resources when they use compromised machines to mine digital currencies.  Trustwave in December uncovered a trove of some 2 million stolen passwords to websites including Facebook Inc, Google Inc, Twitter Inc and Yahoo Inc while probing a command and control server using a less sophisticated version of the Pony malware.  Trustwave said on Monday that the new version of Pony compromised another 600,000 website credentials.  (Users can go to these Trustwave sites to check if their bitcoin wallets and credentials have been stolen:   ####CLEARNET WARNING####  http://bit.ly/1epIUiH  http://bit.ly/1fNAym5  ####CLEARNET WARNING####",""

Also, as for the printing money, you don't understand the algorithm of Litecoin. Just because it can be mined by more users than the almost-centralized BTC it does not mean there will be an extravagant number in supply. There is a limit on how many LTCs are produced per hour, so it can't just keep being produced like you are implying. Just because more people are getting in on the mining doesn't mean shit, the coins that are set to be produced each hour are split between each miner accordingly, meaning it will not devalue the currency in anyway. I suggest you read the original BitcoinTalk thread on Litecoin and maybe head over to Litecoin.org and educate yourself on how the currency works as opposed to slating it just because it is designed to be more decentralized rather than a few powerful miners in the game.","Quote from: Mind on November 13, 2013, 04:43:00 pmQuote from: Cereal on November 13, 2013, 04:17:57 pmQuote from: Mind on November 13, 2013, 04:13:39 pmQuote from: DoctorClu on November 13, 2013, 04:11:08 pmWhy would you want an easily attainable currency?

Your analogy of people printing their own money was an awful one at that, doesn't even apply to this situation.More people have access to powerful CPUs than powerful GPUs. The difficulty of LTC is not as high as BTC. The good thing about your average user not being able to mine is that it requires actual currency to purchase.

","Quote from: Cereal on November 13, 2013, 04:17:57 pmQuote from: Mind on November 13, 2013, 04:13:39 pmQuote from: DoctorClu on November 13, 2013, 04:11:08 pmWhy would you want an easily attainable currency? LTC is too simple to mine with CPUs. One of the betters aspects to BTC is that mining is incredibly difficult.Surely that's a positive, meaning anybody (your normal guy) can mine LTC whereas BTC mining is a craft controlled by only those few with high powered machines. Makes sense to have a greater number of normal people mining rather than just a few really powerful people controlling most of the mining network.Not necessarily. It may devalue the currency - imagine if everyone could print they're own money. Maybe not the best from an economic perspective.That's not the case. Not everybody can mine their own Litecoins, a high grade is still expected. And even if so, you wouldn't be able to just keep printing them, there is a limit on how many can be produced (and based on how many people are mining, the difficulty will adjust accordingly) just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin's total is 21,000,000 coins whereas LTC's is around 84,000,000. Your analogy of people printing their own money was an awful one at that, doesn't even apply to this situation."

Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V  Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.   N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.   Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

If it is fact a 5 panel test, with the results coming in 5 minutes on the strips on side of cup then this is a sure fire way to beat the test no matter what drugs/ amounts you have in your system. This of course only works if you know roughly 3 hours in advance of said U.A.  Drink a massive amount of water, im talking kill a gallon quickly, piss and drink more water. Everytime you use the restroom you drink more water. this is extremely uncomfortable and jesus christ you really piss about every 8 minutes but it effectively will make your body process water so fast it does not have time to push toxins out with it ,really your just pissing strait water.  This is what is called a diluted U.A and since its a five panel or dip strip test then your fine because it does not go to the lab for gassing.  Your urine will be clear and pass with flying colors on that type of test. Too much water in system = untestable U.A = PASS  As for a lab test this is a bit different. the above works just fine BUT when they try to gas your urine it will show way to much water in (think it has to do with a cretin level under 20 = untestable)your system thus rendering it untestable. Not when in prison or on probation and parole this is a big no no but it does give a window of time to do a simply 5 day herbal detox and wait for the call saying you need to retests.  How do you know its a lab test? If you urinate in a cup and they put a lid on it with a sticker going across the top and throw it into a bag then its going to the lab.  5  panel cup will have a strip on the side of cup. There are many different kinds but general construction is the same. 2 lines = pass 1 line = fail for this test.  Good luck",""

Is it enough to simply delete the browser bundle folder? I'm a paranoid person and usually recommend a full disk wipe, even though LE is not going to forensically analyze the free disk space of the average SR user. Mainly my recommendation comes from not knowing what the TBB is leaving behind.  Finally we have answers! Runa Sandvik of the Tor Project is forensically analyzing the traces left behind by the TBB on Linux, Windows and OS X. Her first analysis, published a few days ago, covers Linux (specifically Debian).  ======  As part of a deliverable for two of our sponsors (Sponsor J, Sponsor L), I have been working on a forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle. In this three part series, I will summarize the most interesting or significant traces left behind after using the bundle. This post will cover Debian Linux (#8166), part two will cover Windows 7, and part three will cover OS X 10.8.  Process  I set up a virtual machine with a fresh install of Debian 6.0 Squeeze, logged in once and shut it down cleanly. I then connected the virtual drive to another virtual machine and used dd to create an image of the drive. I also used hashdeep to compute hashes for every file on the drive, and rsync to copy all the files over to an external drive.  After having secured a copy of the clean virtual machine, I rebooted the system, connected an external drive, and copied the Tor Browser Bundle (version 2.3.25-6, 64-bit) from the external drive to my Debian home directory. I extracted the package archive and started the Tor Browser Bundle by running ./start-tor-browser inside the Tor Browser directory.  Once the Tor Browser was up and running, I browsed to a few pages, read a few paragraphs here and there, clicked on a few links, and then shut it down by closing the Tor Browser and clicking on the Exit-button in Vidalia. The Tor Browser did not crash and I did not see any error messages. I deleted the Tor Browser directory and the tarball using rm -rf.  I repeated the steps with dd, hashdeep, and rsync to create a copy of the tainted virtual machine.  Results  Using hashdeep, I compared the hashes from the tainted virtual machine against the hashes from the clean virtual machine: 68 files had a hash that did not match any of the hashes in the clean set. The most interesting files are:  ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata/home: contains the filename of the Tor Browser Bundle tarball: tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-5-dev-en-US.tar.gz. GVFS is the virtual filesystem for the GNOME desktop, so this result will probably vary depending on the window manager used. I have created #8695 for this issue.  ~/.xsession-errors: contains the following string: âWindow manager warning: Buggy client sent a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message with a timestamp of 0 for 0x3800089 (Tor Browse)â. It is worth noting that a file named .xsession-errors.old could also exist. I have created #8696 for this issue.  ~/.bash_history: contains a record of commands typed into the terminal. I started the Tor Browser Bundle from the command line, so this file contains lines such as ./start-tor-browser. I have created #8697 for this issue.  /var/log/daemon.log, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/kern.log, /var/log/messages: contains information about attached devices. I had an external drive attached to the virtual machine, so these files contain lines such as âMounted /dev/sdb1 (Read-Write, label âTHAâ, NTFS 3.1)â and âInitializing USB Mass Storage driverâ¦â.  ======  She doesn't discuss the results, but I find them interesting. The bash commands in the history file are obvious (and won't exist when starting TBB from the file manager or a menu item), but I didn't expect the TBB archive filename to show up in something called gvfs-metadata. I wonder if there is some way to prevent that? And if there isn't at least you now know to shred the files in that folder!  Mitigation strategies are mentioned in the bug reports below.  In her next blog post, she will cover Windows. I bet there will be a lot more traces.

In this three part series, I will summarize the most interesting or significant traces left behind after using the bundle, deleting it, and then shutting down the computer. Part one covered Debian Linux (#8166), this part will cover Windows 7 (#6845), and part three will cover OS X 10.8 (#6846).  Process  I set up a virtual machine with a fresh install of Windows 7, logged in with the default admin account, installed available updates, and shut it down cleanly. I connected the virtual drive to another virtual machine, used hashdeep to compute hashes for every file on the drive, and then rsync to copy all the files over to an external drive.  After having secured a copy of the clean virtual machine, I rebooted the system, connected an external drive, and copied the Tor Browser Bundle (version 2.3.25-6, 64-bit) from the external drive to the Desktop. I extracted the package archive by clicking on the file, then started the Tor Browser Bundle by going into the Tor Browser folder and clicking on Start Tor Browser.exe.

The Tor Browser did not crash and I did not see any error messages. I deleted the Tor Browser folder and the package archive by moving the folder and the archive into the Recycle Bin, right-clicking on it and choosing Empty Recycle Bin.  I repeated the steps with hashdeep and rsync to create a copy of the tainted virtual machine. I also used Noriben, written by Brian Baskin, to create a report of everything the Tor Browser Bundle did while it was running.  Results  Using hashdeep, I compared the hashes from the tainted virtual machine against the hashes from the clean virtual machine: 256 files have hashes that do not match any of the hashes in the clean set. Additionally, the Noriben output shows the Tor Browser Bundle create, edit, and remove a bunch of files.  I have sorted the most interesting findings into different groups, depending on the location, how they were created, and so on. Windows 7 has built-in symbolic links designed for backward compatibility, which is why Noriben and hashdeep list the same files in different locations.  Prefetch  Windows keeps track of the way the system starts and which programs the user commonly opens. This information is saved as a number of small files in the prefetch folder:      C:\Windows\Prefetch\START TOR BROWSER.EXE-F5557FAC.pf     C:\Windows\Prefetch\TBB-FIREFOX.EXE-350502C5.pf     C:\Windows\Prefetch\TOR-BROWSER-2.3.25-6_EN-US.EX-1354A499.pf     C:\Windows\Prefetch\TOR.EXE-D7159D93.pf     C:\Windows\Prefetch\VIDALIA.EXE-5167E0BC.pf  The following cache files are most likely similar to prefetch files and might contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle:      C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\cversions.1.db     C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches{AFBF9F1A-8EE8-4C77-AF34-C647E37CA0D9}.1.ver0x0000000000000006.db     C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\RecentFileCache.bcf  I have created #8916 for this issue.  SetupAPI  SetupAPI and the Plug and Play (PnP) manager write entries to SetupAPI.dev.log and SetupAPI.app.log about operations that install devices and drivers. The following files contain information about the attached external drive:      C:\Windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log     C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\usbstor.inf_amd64_ neutral_0725c2806a159a9d\usbstor.PNF  Thumbnail Cache  Windows stores thumbnails of graphics files, and certain document and movie files, in Thumbnail Cache files. The following files contain the Onion Logo icon associated with the Tor Browser Bundle:      C:\Users\Runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_32.db     C:\Users\Runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_96.db     C:\Users\Runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_256.db  Other Thumbnail Cache files, such as thumbcache_1024.db, thumbcache_sr.db, thumbcache_idx.db, and IconCache.db, may also contain the Onion Logo icon. I have created #8921 for this issue.  Windows Defender  Windows Defender is the default anti-virus software on Windows 7. Windows Defender will write log files to the following location:      C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Support\  The log files will contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle if Windows Defender ever decides to flag it as malware. This is true for any anti-virus software.  Windows Error Reporting (WER)  Windows Error Reporting (WER) captures and logs information about software crashes and other issues. I found information about the attached external drive in the following file:      C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue\NonCritical_x64_ 84cd279a5e83221bfa7edcb36665592c1974e4_cab_0b21673a/DMI671B.tmp.log.xml  The logs will probably contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle if any part of the bundle, such as the Tor Browser or Vidalia, ever hangs or crashes.  Windows Event Log  The following two event logs contain information about the attached external drive:      C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Application.evtx     C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\System.evtx  Windows Paging File  Microsoft Windows uses a paging file, called pagefile.sys, to store frames of memory that do not currently fit into physical memory. The file C:\pagefile.sys contains information about the attached external drive, as well as the filename for the Tor Browser Bundle executable. I have created #8918 for this issue.  Windows Registry  The Windows Registry is a databse that stores various configuration settings and options for the operating system. HKEY_CURRENT_USER, abbreviated HKCU, stores settings that are specific to the currently logged-in user. Each userâs settings are stored in files called NTUSER.DAT and UsrClass.dat.  The path to the Tor Browser Bundle executable is listed in the following two files:      C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat     C:\Users\runa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat.LOG1  I did not find traces of the Tor Browser Bundle in any of the NTUSER.DAT files. I have created #8919 for this issue.  Additionally, the output from Noriben indicates that the Tor Browser Bundle touches the registry by creating keys and setting values. The following value points to the Tor Browser Bundle executable on the attached external drive:      [Set Value] Explorer.EXE:1196 > HKCU\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\MuiCache\E:\tor-browser-2.3.25-6_en-US.exe = 7z SFX  The output also makes it look like the Tor Browser Bundle adds the following keys and values:      [Set Value] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Classes\Local Settings\MuiCache\11\52C64B7E\LanguageList = en-US, en     [CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}     [CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count     [CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}     [CreateKey] tbb-firefox.exe:1124 > HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}\Count  I found that these keys and values are present on a clean Windows 7 system where the Tor Browser Bundle has never been used. I also downloaded and tested the German version of the Tor Browser Bundle to make sure that the LanguageList value does not represent the language of the Tor Browser Bundle.  Windows Search  Windows Search, which is enabled by default, builds a full-text index of files on the computer. One component of Windows Search is the Indexer, which crawls the file system on initial setup, and then listens for file system notifications to index changed files. Windows Search writes a number of files to the following location:      C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\  I have not found a way to read the Windows Search database files, but I would say it is likely that Windows Search picked up the Tor Browser Bundle at some point. I have created #8920 for this issue.  ======  As expected, it leaves a lot more traces on Windows.

I have sorted the most interesting findings into different groups, depending on the location, how they were created, and so on.  Apple System Log (ASL)  The following Apple System Log (ASL) files contain traces of the attached external drive and the Tor Browser Bundle:      /var/log/asl/2013.05.22.U0.G80.asl     /var/log/asl/2013.05.22.U501.asl  I have created #8982 for this issue. I have been not been able to open the following two files, but they may contain traces of the attached drive and the bundle as well:      /var/log/asl/StoreData     /var/log/asl/SweepStore  Crash Reporter and Diagnostic Messages  The Tor Browser Bundle did not crash or hang, but I still found traces of the Tor Browser Bundle in the following files:      /Library/Application Support/CrashReporter/Intervals_00000000-0000-1000-8000-000C2976590B.plist     /var/log/DiagnosticMessages/2013.05.22.asl  I have not been able to open the file StoreData, which can be found in the same DiagnosticMessages directory, but it may also contain traces of the bundle. I have created #8983 for this issue.  FSEvents API  The FSEvents API allows applications to register for notifications of changes to a given directory tree. Whenever the filesystem is changed, the kernel passes notifications to a process called fseventsd. The following file contains the path to the attached external drive, the path to the Tor Browser Bundle on the Desktop, and the path to the Tor Browser Bundle in the Trash:      /.fseventsd/0000000000172019  Other files in the .fseventsd directory may also contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle and/or the attached external drive. I have created #8984 for this issue.  HFS+  HFS+ is the default filesystem on OS X; it supports journaling, quotas, Finder information in metadata, hard and symbolic links, aliases, etc. HFS+ also supports hot file clustering, which tracks read-only files that are frequently requested and then moves them into a âhot zoneâ. The hot file clustering scheme uses an on-disk B-Tree file for tracking.  I have not been able to open /.hotfiles.btree and /.journal, but they might contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle and/or the attached external drive. I have created #8985 for this issue.  Preferences  OS X applications store preference settings in plist files, and the files below are related to system fonts, the file manager, recent items, and the Tor Browser Bundle. These files contain traces of the Tor Browser Bundle and the attached external drive. I have created #8986 for this issue.      /Users/runa/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ATS.plist     /Users/runa/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist     /Users/runa/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems.plist     /Users/runa/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.torbrowser.plist  Saved Application State  Resume is one of the new features in OS X 10.7 and 10.8. The feature allows applications to save their last known state when they are closed, and then return to this state when they are later reopened.  While the Tor Browser does not use this feature, it does leak information in the files which are written to the /Users/runa/Library/Saved Application State/ directory:      /Users/runa/Library/Saved Application State/org.mozilla.torbrowser.savedState/data.data     /Users/runa/Library/Saved Application State/org.mozilla.torbrowser.savedState/window_3.data     /Users/runa/Library/Saved Application State/org.mozilla.torbrowser.savedState/windows.plist  The windows.plist file contains the HTML title tag of the last active tab in the Tor Browser (or currently active tab, if the browser is still open). If the last active tab was torproject.org, then the following string will be present in the file:      Tor Project: Anonymity Online  I have created #8987 for this issue.  Spotlight  Spotlight, and the Metadata Server (mds), indexes all items and files on a system and allows the user to perform system-wide searches for all sorts of items; documents, pictures, applications, system preferences, etc.  I have not been able to open the files in /.Spotlight-V100 and /var/db/mds/messages/, but I would say it is likely that Spotlight and mds picked up the Tor Browser Bundle and the attached external drive at some point. I have created #8988 for this issue.  Swap  OS X relies on swap files and paging for memory and cache management.

The second item is the most troubling, since I think very few of us are/were aware of it.  The third item may only be an error when starting Tor from the command line. I grepped my own .xsession-errors and got nothing.  The fourth item is only an issue when attaching external media, which is not the most common method of getting the browser bundle. Most people will simply download it.  There may be other traces left behind when starting TBB from the file manager, which this analysis would have missed. An example is recently-used.xbel. Launching from a menu or panel item doesn't leave a trace that I know of.  Will be interesting to see how many traces are left on Win7.  Also, none of this even touches true forensic analysis of free and swap space.  To me, the take away message is, use FDE or Tails, or forget about trying to cover up your Tor use. Title: Re: Forensic analysis of Tor use Post by: Green Camel on April 15, 2013, 09:50 pm There's actually a very simple solution:  1. Create a new user 'tbb'. 2. Edit /etc/fstab and put both /var/log and /home/tbb in tmpfs. 3. $ sudo mount -o remount -a && sudo -u tbb -i 4. Download and extract TBB. 5. Use it, and when you're done... 6. $ logout && sudo mount -o remount -a  There will be no trace left of you ever downloading or using TBB.  You can also do something like this before running TBB with your regular user:  $ ln -s /dev/null ~/.xsession-errors Title: Re: Forensic analysis of Tor use",""

I originally posted that to disprove the persistent myth that you need 7, or 15, or -- laughably -- 35 writes to make data unrecoverable.  Under controlled conditions, where the researchers know where to look and what to look for, a single write is sufficient to prevent recovering anything except random, useless bits of information. Under realistic conditions, it should be even harder to recover anything useful. Even the NSA admits that additional overwrites offer no benefit (this is their recommendation to other government agencies that require secure data erase, for example to comply with HIPAA regulations, so it's unlikely they're lying to screw us over).  The analysis paper happens to contain a lot of other useful information. One reason that I like full disk/volume encryption is it allows for near-instant secure data wipes. All you have to do is write over the first 10 or 100 megabytes of the drive, which takes a few seconds to a few tens of seconds, and you have securely wiped your disk. DBANing can take hours to days.

I read your link and am about to demonstrate that I understood it far more comprehensively than you.Quote from: JehovahsWitness on January 23, 2014, 04:23:35 pmThe contents of the actual report were largely ignored by the national media. In the 623rd paragraph, the report described a cable from the CIA's Directorate of Operations dated October 22, 1982, describing a prospective meeting between Contra leaders in Costa Rica for ""an exchange in [the United States] of narcotics for arms, which then are shipped to Nicaragua.""[16] The two main Contra groups, US arms dealers, and a lieutenant of a drug ring which imported drugs from Latin America to the US west coast were set to attend the Costa Rica meeting. The lieutenant trafficker was also a Contra, and the CIA knew that there was an arms-for-drugs shuttle and did nothing to stop it.[15] The report stated that the CIA had requested the Justice Department return $36,800 to a member of the Meneses drug ring, which had been seized by DEA agents in the Frogman raid in San Francisco. The CIA's Inspector General said the Agency wanted the money returned ""to protect an operational equity, i.e., a Contra support group in which it [CIA] had an operational interest.""[15]1. You can find this report linked in the wiki, but I know you don't care. Oh, I cared - so much so that I went to find out exactly what was written in paragraph 623. I then read paragraphs 624, 625 and 626, and discovered why the contents of the actual report was ignored by the media: Quote624     No information has been found to indicate whether a meeting in fact took place in Costa Rica to discuss an exchange of narcotics for arms as described in the October 1982 cable. However, a November 1982 Headquarters cable discussed the alleged meeting and stated:          1. It is HQS opinion that much of information contained in [the October 1982 and November 1982 cables] simply does not make sense (i.e., UDN/FDN cooperation, need to obtain armament through illegal means, shipment of arms to Nicaragua, involvement with the [specific U.S.-based religious organization]). We see a distinct possibility that the [INS] source was either intentionally or unintentionally misinformed. However, since the information was surfaced by another [U.S. Government] agency and may return to haunt us, feel we must try to confirm or refute the information if possible. To best [anyone's] knowledge, have the [Contras] scheduled any meeting in the next few weeks? If so, what information do you have regarding the attendees? Do you have any other information which might relate to contents of [referenced messages].        . . . . 625   A November 1982 response to Headquarters reported that:          . . . . On 16 November, [Eden Pastora] has dispatched Carlos Coronel and Arturo Cruz, Jr. to U.S. for series of meetings, among them meeting with [FRS] supporters in San Francisco.626    No record has been found to indicate that Headquarters was provided with any additional information in response to the November Headquarters cable. Nevertheless, CIA records do indicate that Cardenal was in San Jose, Costa Rica, from around October 30 or 31, 1982 until November 5, 1982 and again from around December 27 to December 31, 1982 for meetings with Contra leaders. No information has been found to indicate that these meetings pertained to any exchange of narcotics for arms. Moreover, no information has been found to indicate what contacts, if any, Cardenal may have had with representatives of the specific U.S.-based religious organization.Haha, you lose, motherfucker.  Quote from: JehovahsWitness on January 23, 2014, 04:23:35 pm2.

HOWEVER ""Reagan administration admits contra cocaine connection"" IS NOT THE SAME as your claim that the CIA ran a large-scale drug-op Quote from: JehovahsWitness on January 23, 2014, 04:23:35 pmYou need to explain this one to a feeble mind like me. Cos it is most obviously the same to me.OK then, and incidentally, well spotted. It would appear that your mind is unbelievably feeble, but then English doesn't appear to be your first language, so maybe you have a slight excuse for your rampant stupidity. So, Reagan admitted the Contras were in the cocaine business. (And by the time he did so I don't think anyone was particularly surprised.) However, this was not an admission that the CIA ran a large-scale drug operation. I'm not sure how much clearer I can be on this matter. Unless you're saying that the CIA *were* the Contras, which would be a very controversial assertion, and something that Wikipedia would tactfully describe as ""original research"".

Iranian Revolution 1979                                 2. Many hostages released the DAY Reagan took office.                                3. Additional Hostages still held for several years.                                4. Reagan/Bush trade guns to Iran for Hostages and Money.                                5. Money from Arms sales to Iran used to fund death squads/drug dealers in Nicaragua,                                    Guatemala, and to prop up Gen. Noriega in Panama, via Col.Oliver North.                                 6. Col. North, upon being suppoenaed by Congress, does not recall helping the                                     death squads.  This is particularly disturbing, because they killed kids and old                                      people, many Refugees denied immigration into US, because they will not admit                                      the CIA directly gave aid to the death squads.                                7.  Everyone forgets what happened because North is pardoned, Bush wins in '88.                                 8.  organizations set up in Colombia contine to sell drugs without                                      Panama or  Noriega, who is taken out in 24hr war, US murders                                     thousands of Panamanian citizens near canal zone using 'Spooky' gunships.                                      It is estimated that Panamanian banks held 90% of the cocaine money at that time.                                      Heavy Metal music is too much for Noreiga, who is shipped to US.                                  9. Bush covers up FUCKING EVERYTHING, as president.                                  10. President Clinton is threatened with impeachment to keep off Bush's trail.                                        When Bush II is elected, everyone forgets about death squads or murders.                                          This is a basic timeline, any questions?  As far as I'm concerned, if you can get away with murder, selling drugs is the least of your problems.  They massacred DOZENS of whole villages, mostly women and children who couldn't hide or run fast enough.  You think they give two fucks about cocaine? how do you think the FARC got so big?         The far-left guerilla fighters were a direct reaction to economic oppression of the americas and the Death Squads, because they were scared of that shit, the US treats central/south america like colonies. Reagan/Bush funded the paramillitary death squads in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, etc.  Death-on-Demand I call it.  They only spray roundup on coca that doesn't go where they want it to, mostly to the right-wing paramilitaries and to prop up their cherry-picked leaders.  Yeah, they will sell drugs if it helps them out.

Again practice this little test and know 30 seconds by feeling your fingers one at a time, 30 times.  Visine is good. But if you smell like alcohol its hard to pass that metered breath test.  Best of all , DONT DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","dipset1","8181","2014-02-17T21:23:02","Ever been pulled over for a DUI? Want to know how to handle it?","Discussion/Legal","If you get pulled over and really are drunk (over the legal BAC) then DO NOT blow into their breath device on the side of the road, or especially at the station as the DataMaster machine, or whatever they have, is pretty irrefutable in court. You will lose your license (implied consent) and would likely anyway for the DUI, but you can sometimes avoid a DUI conviction with a good lawyer if you play your cards right. I got pulled over for pulling over to use my phone. Got lit up by an asshole cop who said I almost hit a guard rail. ""I was like ya, you mean when I used my turn signal to safely pull to the shoulder to use my phone in a safe manner?""   I knew this cop's reputation and knew I was fucked. He immediately had me out of the car and asked to do field sobriety tests as they waited for a mobile breath unit. I obliged, thinking I had to. However, in this particular state implied consent is only violated when you refuse a mechanical or blood test type evidentiary test. I should have said, ""I will wait for a breath device to get here, then cooperate.""  It was cold, we were parked on a steep hill on the highway, and this cop still expected me to walk and turn and do balance tests on uneven ground, knowing full well I was being set up to fail. I had an injury at the time that made these field sobriety test painful and impossible for me to pass. And that asshat knew it.   Finally, the breath device shows up with another cop on scene. And I blew into the device, feeling confident I would pass. (Also, always ask them the last time the device was calibrated, if you're outside your vehicle and in front of the cruiser the dash cam might be on, and his likely answer of ""idk"" will be recorded and hopefully help you in court). I blew a .028, well below the .08 legal limit. Still this asshole was bird dogging me because I refused to turn my pockets inside out and only emptied a few things out of them as he patted me down for ""weapons"" and felt a small baggie in my front pocket. Once he felt that, I knew he was going to get me in handcuffs one way or another.   He tried another bullshit test with a flashlight before shining it in my mouth saying ""your tongue is green you've been smoking marijuana"" and arrested me for a drug DUI pretty much on that alone it seemed. About ten minutes earlier he said my tongue has a whitish layer, and asked my what drugs I was on. I was like ""make up your fucking mind dude, you have no idea what substance, if any, I am on. And have contradicted yourself more than once.""   I was speechless, almost. I knew this cop's history and started spouting off his transgressions in front of his superiors. I have never been thrown in the back of a cruiser so quickly. LOL.    After putting me in cuffs he searched my pockets and found a very tiny amount of alprazolam powder in a paper fold and then a plastic baggie (the paper fold saved my ass a bit, as he ended up searching it without a warrant, so always have opaque layers to obscure drugs in bags, trust me on this one). Anyway, they couldn't NIK test the xanax which was pretty funny to see them try. Only a GC/MS machine will detect alprazolam and they cost upwards of one hundred grand. They put me in an interrogation room and made me wait hours in the middle of the night/morning to tire me out, until a Drug Recognition Expert came in to try and ascertain what I was on. I told him politely to fuck off, and continually asked to call my lawyer. They ignored me and it wasn't until I picked up a chair while handcuffed to the wall and slammed it repeatedly into the floor to get their attention. It worked, the chief came in to bitch at me, and I demanded my phone call which he then had to oblige. Here's where it got really shady. They left the camera in the interrogation room rolling and recorded my call with my lawyer (super illegal, and unconstitutional) over a fucking DUI, no less. Not like I just killed someone.   I took my lawyer's advice to cooperate with a blood sample as drug DUIs are hard to prove, and eventually was release with a citation and court date. I lawyered up, he went to bat on this dirty cops tactics, never activating his dash cam (which meant it was his word against mine as to how I was driving, if there was video, I would have been exonerated right then and there), the phone call recording, and the warrantless search of the bindle of drugs.  They had a shitty case, and they knew it. So I lawyered up with one of the best firms in the state I got busted in, and ended up beating the DUI. I had to take a plea deal that involved a fine and charged me with a misdemeanor of negligent or carelesss operation of a motor vehicle. Bullshit, but I would have likely been convicted of a DUI if we went to trial. Not to mention the extra expense of a criminal defense attorney going to trial. It sucked big time, but in the end. It didn't turn out how the arresting officer wanted it to, so I am OK with it, I guess.   And now I know he never activates his dash cam, so I've passed this along to every scumbag I know in hopes that somebody will just cap his ass and drive off. If there are no witnesses on the side of the road and no video, you'd stand a good chance of getting away.      ",""

I did receive a reply from someone I think is an admin (but the admins don't have any badges saying, so I'm not sure) basically saying 'nothing to see here, Ross/SR was taken down due to mistake made by Ross, nothing to do with technological means' or some such. My reply was 'yes, Ross exposed his IRL identity through mistakes, but they got the server before they nabbed Ross, so how did they find the server? It's not supposed to be possible'.

International shipping. After one month - no package in my post box. Later i've seen in SR that this vendor just gone. And he didn't dispatch my item.  Later on i've got some changes in my live, and i moved to live in another house. My old flat was rent by one of my friends friend. Hes not my close friend. He dont know me very well, but we have seen each other couple of times. But he know some of my friends very well.  The time was going and I just found that this vendor came back. And i've read some feedbacks that customers got their delayed orders. I thought mine never was sent, and he will never do this.  BUT ! Item was shiped to my old flat (old encrypted address) which was already rent to one of my friends friend! Can you beleive that - after 3 months!  I've got a call from one of my mates. And he told me:  Friend called him. Police came at your old flat. They've been looking for you! They asked about you. Friend told them, that i don't live here anymore. He doesn't gave for LE any information about me, because he don't know, where i am living now and he don't know my ID number also. (But he knows how im looking). Then LE told him, that letter with drugs was shipped to thiss addres, with my name. That's why now the cops are looking for me. Also they tried to ask this to the house owner (lessor). But the rental agreement, was created not on my name. So owner didnt had my ID number also.  Now i need a professional help. Should i go to the lawyer? But what can i tell him?  Please give me advises. LE now are looking for me. But all they have is my name/surname. I dunno LE figured out who i am or not. Iv'e never been registered on that house address.  Also what should I tell to the friends? Now everybody will know, that some drugs was sent to me. But nobody knows about the deals like this. They dont know what is SR. Im not a regular drugs user. Im occasional user. Some friends even dont know that im using this. Some of my friends thinkig i never ever would touch this at all. But i also have some friends, with which i had used this. And i shared my great quality drugs with them. But they were thinking im getting this from the street.   My biggest mistake was, that i used my name to order. But i have read a lot about security, and mostly reccomended was to use your real name.  So, what should i tell to the friends about that letter? Please suggest me something. Is it very risky now to order from SR again? (Before this i had some orders to my new house, all of them was received, no probs at all. But now im afraid).  If i would order, Should i use now a fake name? Or maybe should i take a break from SR for at least 6 months. To see LE will find me or not.  Im afraid to get raid at least. My house now are clean of course.  I appreciate all of yours comments about this.   Thanks.   ",""

I dont see why posting to a forum on the darknet would be a problem tho. Nothing illegal happens here on the forum that Ive seen unless you buy drugs off the forum which is dumb anyway. Still, it should be deleted and wiped tho.   Keep in mind the govt has the best encryption breaking computers on the planet. Plus backdoors. Nothings 100% in security.  Security is an illusion.

Answer your questions?Of course my friend. Thanks to all, for answers. Really helped me.And yeah, it was only 1g. For me its also was a big surprise, that they did a control delivery instead of love letter. Maybe i dunno something.. Maybe those peaople in my old house, got a envelope, opened it and enjoyed. Then decided to talk a bullshit about crime police at the doors. To make me scare.. No body knows. Iv'e got this info from one of my friends. Which knows those peoples in the house. They told this to him.One more question. If police would raid me. And they would take my computer... My computer is locked with a password. In this case, do i must to tell the my computer password? There is a Law about this? That suspect people must to tell his computer password?Because i have locked in one program some info with dark markets bookmarks, logins etc.What kind of a password? Windows password? That doesn't do jack fucking shit. You have to format your hard drive, 3 times, and then write zeroes over it so they can not retrieve the files from the hard drive. Even if you delete everything, they will still find it.Either that, or you search a program called ""truecrypt"" and encrypt your whole hard disk with the most time-consuming option. It will take a few hours to encrypt it, but then police won't be able to see anything on it. Unless you give them your truecrypt password. But even if you do, you can put up a fake password and a real password. If you give them the fake truecrypt password - it will work but it will show them an alternative folder where you  can put up a bunch of gay porn so it will look like that's the reason you encrypted your hard drive. LE will have no way of knowing that you have 2 passwords.Just read up on ""truecrypt"" and install it. Highly recommend. You can find everything you need to know on Google. DO IT NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!My HDD is fully encrypted with FileVault. I did it once i started to use it. So i think its impossible for LE to broke in my HDD or not? The question is, if they would ask my login password and i refuse to tell them. What's then? That means that im quilty in that case because im hiding something?"

If you do that then not only do you give up your right to silence but you're fucking giving LE probable cause to justify a search of what you're hiding. And in both of those cases none of them made it far enough along that they had to actually reveal a passphrase to LE.

Its so nice to have in here the professional peoples.   I already changed all my passwords. Im glad that everytime i had used PGP Encryption on my orders.  Im glad that, when package was seized and polce came to the house with a control delivery - i was already living in another house (for at least 2 months). Because if they would find me there - nobody knos what would happen then.   I did only one mistake, that i used my real name for the shipment. That's all. All they have is my name. And if they would ask me, did i lived there? I would tell them the true. But for an envelope with a drugs - i know nothing and i would blame someone else. That somebody had used my addy and name for a conspiracy.  Now maybe they have an eye on me, listening my phone calls... or maybe not. Nobody knows. It was my first order from USA. And it was seized. I had some orders from Argentina ant most EU countrys. I've received all of them without doubt. I dunno im suprised this one was not just seized, but also with a control delivery. So i've got scared.. But all of yours support help'ed me a lot. Because i can't speak about this problem with anybody personaly. My brother, my girlfriend, my closest friends. Nobody knows about it. Im alone in here with only you commynity support! All my friends, who knows that at sometimes i had used best quality yeyo.. some of them knows about it, because i shared it with them.. So i mean all of them was thinkig that i having a good connections on the street. Nobody never knew about my Silk roads deal - expect all of you.  Now i will not order for at least 3 months. I need to carefuly plan my new drop addy. From this time i will never order to my home post box, because i can't use my name anymore. It must be someone else post box, with someone else name.  For me its not problem to live without drugs. But for a special partys i need it. My next order will be for a christmas party.  Now my problem is only, that when more and more friends will get to know from those bastards, which they living in my old flat (as i told you, that we have some the same friends) and which can't keep they mounths shutted up, that it was a mail for me with a drugs. Everybody will look into me suspicious...   I'd like to thanks for all of you for the support!",""

Of late, there have been multiple complaints from a number of users, who report being locked out of their market accounts, due to problems with two-factor-authentication. These problems are almost entirely preventable, if a little care is taken when the user first turns-on TFA.   Before I get into that, let's first review  what TFA is,  why you need it, and finally,  how it works   What is Two-Factor-Authentication, Anyway?  In essence, two-factor-authentication is an anti-fraud measure. The idea is to make it harder, if not well-nigh impossible, for someone to impersonate you and access your account, ripping off all your coins.  Google and others have also begun to use two-factor-authentication in an effort to combat email account hijacking.    Why is TFA necessary?  Two-Factor-Authentication is necessary due to a property inherent to BitCoin, i.e. non-reversibility of transactions. If someone gains access to your account, they can transfer your coins to an address that they own or control, and you are well and truly left holding the bag -- there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.   There have been instances on SR1 where people (even vendors) have been phished. Most often this was done by the victim visiting a site like The Hidden Wiki, and copying the ostensible Silk Road address from there. The problem with that, is that malicious persons were often able to edit the The Hidden Wiki, and replace the real Silk Road .onion address with a .onion address pointing to a phishing site that they controlled. These phishing sites were were setup to look very much like the real Silk Road site login page, except that the phishing sites frequently prompted people to enter their PIN to login, whereas the real Silk Road site did not.   Many people, even a few vendors, fell for this, thinking that perhaps DPR had changed the site, and was now requiring PINs for access. Once you had 'logged-in' to the phishing site, you were frequently greeted with some message to the effect that the site was temporarily down for maintenance, and to try again later. The idea behind this, of course, was to prevent people from realizing that they had NOT accessed the real Silk Road site -- furthermore, it gave the phishers time to access your  real Silk Road account and make off with all your coins.   Once the phishers had your username, password, and PIN, they had ALL they needed to immediately access the real Silk Road site, access your account, and remove all your coins.  By the time you realized your mistake, it was too late -- they had already cleaned-out your account.   A little over a year ago, when BTC were $5 U.S. or thereabouts, there was relatively little incentive to attempt to phish accounts -- the haul you could make off with was fairly small. Today, with single coins ranging between $500 and $1200 in value, there is a much, much greater incentive to attempt to phish even user accounts.   As a result, the need for anti-fraud measures (like TFA) has never been greater.    How Two-Factor-Authentication (TFA) Works  When you login without TFA, you will see the following:   * A field to enter your username  * A field to enter your password  * A captcha (distorted letters) and a field to enter the result  See Figure 0 (not filled-out): https://anonfiles.com/file/b0d0422661bc8fa59f11f18a8201665a  See Figure 0A (Filled out): https://anonfiles.com/file/d3c60adac72dbc9904b1a16b86dc1ffb  Enter the correct username, password and captcha, and you will be logged-in to your account.   Naturally, if anyone were to learn your username and password, they could login to your account, and steal all your coins.   To begin the process of setting-up two-factor-authentication, you need to login to your account as normal, and then click the Settings button in the upper right hand corner.   See Figure 1: https://anonfiles.com/file/c805bb6f75d4e28c38db7cc061e9d6aa  After you click on the Settings button, you will see the TFA screen as can be seen in Figure 2:   See Figure 2: https://anonfiles.com/file/69b93cd3b5744bf08fe337c478a9efaf  To enable TFA you need to do 3 things:   1) Paste-in a proper PGP key into the space provided; and   2) Check the box labeled ""Enable-two factor authentication using your PGP key""; and  3) Click the button labeled Update User.   If you have done everything correctly, you can logout and re-login using TFA.   Pay very close attention to this next section, because I'm going to outline two of the most common errors that you can make -- one of these will prevent TFA from working in the first place, and the second, more serious,   WILL LOCK YOU OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT.   How To Prevent Things from Going Wrong, and what You Can Do If They Do  One of the errors that will prevent TFA from being turned-on at all, is using an improper PGP key. By improper, I mean PGP keys that have NO encryption sub-key. Kleopatra is literally notorious for generating such keys, as are certain versions of PortablePGP.   The software on the main site will reject these keys, giving you an error message which you can see in the following Figure:   See Figure 3: https://anonfiles.com/file/bd3dc8e86b629de86647df0e97d83621  The second, far more serious error, will result in you being locked-out of your account. I am referring to pasting-in the  wrong PGP key, i.e. one you do NOT have the private half to.   The way TFA works is as follows:   You login as normal, with your username, password and captcha.  If these are correct, you are presented with a second screen, as can be seen in Figure 4.   See Figure 4: https://anonfiles.com/file/08a42ea4e3c8c5225d3f8ba4017859e9  AS you can see, you are presented with a PGP-encrypted data block, containing a randomly-generated 26-character alphabetic string. In order to login, you have to decrypt the PGP-encrypted data block, recover the string, and paste the string into the space below where it says, decrypted string.   PGP-Encrypted Data Block:   -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  wcFMAyoivAAyMtSCARAAqIx+axaPemboe2npRdR+kQyXxQPjX5YwBDE3BN96CwJ hrrd2fEW2QByXmur3nmxoc1/9mYMYoiMmFKw8bngPltZcrqW+TTiQ92imboKX9e Hr0fjSHQEKxj3Ow2mui3eoOPQvmEMKDw6mCuh5dILPxjtE1WXQUxbKClq61TIUv hkoX+oZphULuEGAtrZhJ0toWXjaO4959keLeAGA8Wke8ev+GRIKMNcKttuYN6da QZB/r0F5JgUuUhyHt1fvI1IE5ngf1GfhowOGSGOmUDN8iZKR5bOh6Nq5tolLivq ulMuYh0GtV0U2EE68Jb7cBpjmWB89+Tyy7Gq6+p5zNOhSbv8XXDSaKkAMPhNyhj AdND6g3LB+gm8lyoGF7CgVZ8V2XaUfl82pIf2FYiwt3+cIwdb1KeK9H9pXtJbyG hASFxcppjWSzWOSe+EXkACnkeq3JU+GaJm6ZoX37z7l7L2KOqeY0WxDm/I7/kUU DWsM6cnlga1ug4KJF0rl+Qg2c5SCy5V7ZO8xUKTwD6vllyY0epUV/s8/92JQH2J UvMkZCyMygxRvl8uncDoXY+bAkQxcu4XiTj/5lT3SEEjGtmBDSvnFPdBOFSZqFv CiJnblx9WWHDAcaaDE7chZv3LIJUr2XjVu8nPMlgK2r5hDN7ApY8tIQFqbcC/LX oxPU60y3V/SSwHlhztx1YfTZqjhxHe8jHUMsG4h1fGUww+JLPkwrqETArXxyb01 gGNr4eizs+03qlPoB0iBIQptK+uStjbr7DPBGg3m4aGKQWNmTg== =ikcJ -----END PGP MESSAGE-----  Decrypted string: ojixqdcbuewyvanlpszkmtfhrg   See Figure 5: https://anonfiles.com/file/a48f9ed2519b2001cfa7877b12095ccf  If the value you paste-in is correct, you will be logged-into your account.   The key thing to take away from this is that the private half of the PGP keypair is  essential in order to be able to decrypt the PGP-encrypted data block.   If you use a public key for which you do not have the private half, you will be unable to decrypt the data block presented to you, which you must decrypt to be able to login. You will often get error messages from your PGP client to the effect of, ""No Private Key Found"".  You will then be locked-out of your account.   How To Tell Which PGP Keys Belong To You?  This is the easy part. Most people on here aren't going to have dozens, or even hundreds of keys on their keyrings -- rather, they will have just a handful of keys on their keyrings, only one or two of which will belong to them (i.e. have the private halves.)  Here is how to tell, for various GPG front-ends, which keys you have the private half to:    GPG4USB  Look on the pane to the right of the editor pane. Any key that has a little pair of gold/silver keys beside it, is a key for which you possess the private half.   See Figure 6: https://anonfiles.com/file/46868bb4a41fbce462e31ee2edf476fa   GPG KeyChain Access (Mac OS X)  Look in the left-most column under Type. If you see a designation sec/pub, this means that you have the secret key. Other keys, for which you do not have the secret key, will show the Type merely as pub.    Tails  Click on the little black square on the top menu bar to open-up the terminal.   Enter the following command: gpg --list-secret-keys   You will see a list of your secret keys that you currently have in Tails.   N.B. Instructions as to how to import/backup your keys in Tails are beyond the scope of this tutorial.   See Figure 7: https://anonfiles.com/file/f8c085fe26d13729061ab69793f7a66a  Provided that you use a standards-compliant PGP key, i.e. one generated by GPG4USB, GPGTools, or Tails, and one that belongs to you, for which you have the private half, you should be just fine.     The single best tip I can give you is as follows: Before you paste your PGP public key from the clipboard into the two-factor-authentication box, import it again to your keyring, first -- you will then see a confirmation dialog of some type that will show you which key you will be pasting-in from the clipboard. This will show you if you are, in fact, pasting-in your own key, as opposed to someone else's. This step alone could prevent you from making a catastrophic error!   Nightcrawler 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler <Nightcrawler@SR> PGP Key Fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7  3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B  Security is a bit like religion... some things have to be taken on faith.  Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.  The original DPR is the poster child for that, right now.  Folly, thou conquerest, and I must yield! Against stupidity the very gods Themselves contend in vain.  --Friedrich Schiller ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","StingRay","6381","2013-12-05T16:13:05","China Restricts Banksâ Use of Bitcoin","Discussion/Security","(Clearnet) http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/business/international/china-bars-banks-from-using-bitcoin.html  HONG KONG â China moved on Thursday to restrict its banks from using Bitcoin as currency, citing concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability.  The action comes as monetary authorities around the world have begun to confront the issue of Bitcoin, a virtual currency whose value has soared in recent months as interest in it has spread. Part of its rise has been driven by intense demand for the virtual currency in China.  The notice curtailing financial institutionsâ involvement with Bitcoin was issued by the Peopleâs Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies, and the directive said the step was needed to âprotect the status of the renminbi as the statutory currency, prevent risks of money laundering and protect financial stability.â  The notice said that Bitcoin was ânot a currency in the real meaning of the wordâ but was rather a âvirtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency. Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.â  Last month, in a sign of Bitcoinâs growing acceptance, American regulatory officials told a Senate hearing that financial networks like Bitcoin offered tangible benefits for the financial system. But they warned of the potential for money laundering and other criminal activity associated with such networks.  The remarks by United States officials, along with wider acceptance of the virtual currency by merchants, had helped propel the value of the virtual currency beyond $1,100, leaving its total worldwide value at more than $11 billion. It dropped more than $100 on Thursday, according to the Mt.Gox exchange, which handles Bitcoin trading online, to $1,100 from $1,217.  Bitcoin was established in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Part of the value of the currency is attributable to its limited supply. A maximum of 21 million units can be created, leading investors to bid up the price as demand grows.  But with the growing acceptance of the virtual currency has come increasing concerns about its potential use in illicit transactions. In October, the American authorities arrested Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of the online marketplace Silk Road, after claiming that the site was being used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and pornography. Bitcoin was the primary form of payment on Silk Road, where people could make purchases anonymously.  The Chinese move came after officials in Beijing had expressed some support for the legitimacy of Bitcoin. Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the Peopleâs Bank of China and the director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said in November that although the virtual currency might not find favor with Chinaâs central bank, people should be free to participate in the Bitcoin market.  That sentiment was echoed in the announcement Thursday.  âOrdinary members of the public have the freedom to participate in Bitcoin transactions as a kind of commodity trading activity on the Internet, provided they assume the risks themselves,â the statement said.  In China, Bitcoin was starting to gain favor even among merchants. In the Chaoyang district in Beijing, a restaurant started accepting Bitcoins for payment in defiance of earlier regulation stating that virtual currencies could not be used to purchase real-life goods or services.  But in its statement Thursday, the Chinese central bank raised questions about whether Bitcoin could ever gain true legitimacy as legal tender: âIn essence, Bitcoin is a kind of special virtual commodity, and does not have the same legal status as a currency.â  âCurrently, the public lacks sufficient understanding of Bitcoin, and some individuals have been caught up by faddishness or a speculative mentality in holding, using and trading in Bitcoins,â the statement said.

They don't like having the factory specs modified and as such, usually come with a trimmed down B.I.O.S with many options and tweaks found on similar PC's either disabled or removed altogether.  To get your PC to boot from the USB, you'll need to change the boot priority in the B.I.O.S and restart your PC. If that doesn't work, you may need to flash your B.I.O.S with the most recent, up to date version available (download from either the PC manufacturers website or the motherboards website if made by a third party such as Asus, Gigabyte, etc.). Your USB should boot after a B.I.O.S upgrade with the new added features not previously available on earlier versions.",""

When the first S.R. went down, I believe I created a new thing on gpg, due to my original one being tied to a tormail account. So once I heard about tormail being compromised, I'm pretty sure I created a new key with a diff. email. So idk how this old version popped up. Hope this info helps.;hmmm i believe i found the private key..but still getting same error message. how do i paste in the private key to my profile?"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Great God Pan","1985","2013-11-10T02:18:33","Copying the Persistent folder in tails","Discussion/Security","Here are the steps from the Tails documentation to manually copy your persistent data to a new device.  You can get to these instructions in Tails by doubl-clicking on the Tails Documentation icon on the desktop, clicking on Documentation on the right side of the page, then going to 'Upgrade to more secure persistent volume settings' under the 'First steps with Tails' heading.  These instructions explain how to manually copy your persistent data to a new device. Follow them if you have good reasons to think that your persistence settings are corrupted or if want to be extra careful.  Create a new device  1.  Install Tails 0.21 or later onto a new device using the usual installing instructions. Do not use the Tails device that might be corrupted in the process of installing the new one. 2.  Create a persistent volume on this new device. We advice you to use a different passphrase to protect this new persistent volume. 3.  Enable again on this new device the persistence features of your choice. 4.  Restart Tails and enable persistence.  Rescue your files from the old Tails device  1.  Plug in the old Tails device from which you want to rescue your data. 2.  Choose Applications â¸ System Tools â¸ Disk Utility to open the GNOME Disk Utility. 3.  In the left panel, click on the device corresponding to the old Tails device. 4.  In the right panel, click on the partition labeled as Encrypted. The Partition Label must be TailsData. 5.  Click on Unlock Volume to unlock the old persistent volume. Enter the passphrase of the old persistent volume and click Unlock. 6.  Click on the TailsData partition that appears below the Encrypted Volume partition. 7.  Click on Mount Volume. The old persistent volume is now mounted as /media/TailsData. 8.  Choose Places â¸ TailsData from the top navigation bar to open the old persistent volume. 9.  In the file browser, choose File â¸ New Tab and navigate to /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked in this new tab. 10.  Click on the TailsData tab. 11.  To import a folder containing persistent data from the old persistent volume to the new one, drag and drop that folder from the TailsDataonto the TailsData_unlocked tab. When importing a folder, choose to Merge All the folder, and Replace All files. Do not import a folder if you do not know what it is used for. -The apt folder corresponds to the APT Packages and APT Lists persistence features. But it requires administration rights to be imported and this goes beyond the scope of these instructions. Note that this folder does not contain personal data. -The bookmarks folder corresponds to the Browser bookmarks persistence feature. -The claws-mail folder corresponds to the Claws Mail persistence feature. -The dotfiles folder corresponds to the Dotfiles persistence feature. -The gnome-keyring folder corresponds to the GNOME Keyring persistence feature. -The gnupg folder corresponds to the GnuPG persistence feature. -The nm-connections folder corresponds to the Network Connections persistence feature. -The openssh-client folder corresponds to the SSH Client persistence feature. -The Persistent folder corresponds to the Personal Data persistence feature. -The pidgin folder corresponds to the Pidgin persistence feature.

To accomplish this the PORTAL device itself is physically isolated and locked down to prevent malicious tampering originating from the protected network. So if the userâs computer is compromised by malware, the malware is unable to modify the Tor software or configuration, nor can it directly access the Internet (completely preventing IP address leakage). Additionally, the PORTAL is configured to fail close â if the connection to Tor drops, the user loses their Internet access. Finally, the PORTAL is âidiot proofâ, simply turn it on and it works.The Implementation, the Pain, the HorrorThe initial requirement was to develop PORTAL for a small personal sized router, such as the TP-Link 703N, 3040, or M1U. All of these devices are small, portable and support the OpenWRT open source router firmware. Unfortunately, it turns out that âsmallâ and âportableâ is synonymous with âweakâ and âunderpoweredâ.Unfortunately, Tor is quite resource intensive for an embedded device. Tor uses 16MB of RAM and for complete functionality (requiring the GeoIP database) it occupies slightly over 1.2MB of squashfs space. The stock TP-LINK routers have only 4MB of flash and 16MB of RAM (later models have increased RAM). This caused a lot of problems when building early versions. A bare bones OpenWRT system stripped down to just support an Internet uplink USB device occupies 3.2MB of squashfs space. Using the power of math we see: 3.2 + 1.2 > 4.0. Fuck.Enter The Dragon, or Chinese Hackers to the RescueFortunately, the TP-LINK routers are not just small, they are also extremely hackable. They are very popular with hackers who have modified the hardware and expanded the capabilities of the stock device. I got in contact with a Chinese hacker who has upgraded the TP-LINK 703N to 16MB of flash and 64MB of RAM. Sweet. Using these modified routers development of the PORTAL became much much easier.PORTAL System ArchitectureThe PORTAL requires a minimum of two network interfaces: one for the Internet uplink, and one for the isolated network segment. In order to protect the PORTAL from tampering from malware (or malicious users), it also requires a third administration interface. This can be either a serial console, or physical connection. The reason not to use WiFi for the administration network is that that would expose the administration interface to anyone within WiFi range, including potentially the userâs compromised laptopâs WiFi card.Three Interfaces to Rule Them AllThe requirement to protect the PORTAL from a malicious user caused some problems since the device hardware has very limited interfaces. The TP-LINK 703N has only:* 1 x USB 2.0* 1 x 100MB ethernet* 1 x onboard wifiAll available interfaces are required to get us to the three networks we need:* Tor: isolated proxy interface    * Tor SOCKS proxy    * Tor Transparent TCP proxy    * Tor Transparent DNS proxy    * DHCP (optional)* Admin: configuration management interface    * ssh    * https (optional)    * DHCP (optional)* Internet: uplink connection interface    * No servicesOperational PORTALAfter the user has configured the Internet, and whatever other adjustments they wish to make, they shouldnât need to connect to the Admin interface again. This leaves us with a very hard target for any attacker who wishes to unmask us (modulo any issues with Tor itself).The PORTAL has been hardened to make it significantly more difficult for the user to make a mistake, or for an attacker to subvert the Tor protections. From the Tor network the only exposed ports are Torâs DNS proxy, TCP proxy, and SOCKS. Optionally, you can use DHCP on this network.If, somehow, the firewall doesnât work properly, youâre still safe because the PORTAL doesnât actually route packets. The only way you can reach the Internet (regardless of which interface youâre connected to) is via Tor. This stops stupid mistakes, such as connecting to the Admin interface and forgetting to swap to the Tor network. Donât worry, you canât do that, it wonât work, youâre welcome.Final hardening is left up to the user who will have to assign the Admin and Tor networks to physical interfaces. There are security trade offs either way.    Medium Security:        Tor = WiFi        Admin = Ethernet        pros: ease of use        cons: pre-Tor plaintext will be broadcast over the AEther (see: Hammond)    Maximum Security:        Tor = Ethernet        Admin = WiFi        pros: ultra secure        cons: if an attacker cracks your WPA2 PSK, theyâll have access to your management sshd. Of course, theyâll be so physically close to you at that point, leaking your IP is the least of your worries.        NOTE: remote the WiFi card from your computer to block access via malware compromiseJust Do ItThe PORTAL project has been migrated to the RaspberryPi, which has more power to support Tor. It requires more configuration, which is something Iâll work on, however the ease of acquisition of the RPi makes this the current platform of choice. So go install PORTAL of Pi and compartment all of your sensitive operational activities inside an isolated Tor network."

Everyone comes in and dumps their quarters into the piggy bank and leaves them in there for an amount of time determined by themselves.  Then a day, week or month later, the person can come back and take their quarters back out. They have the option of taking out all of their quarters, or some of their quarters. They can have some of their quarters sent to Wallet A, some sent to Wallet B, and some sent to Wallet C.  This severs the link between the source wallet that sent all the coins into the piggy bank in the first place.   The reason why this person from Sheep was traceable, was that they had an unusually large amount of coins in their wallet. If you put in 5000 BTC, and withdraw 5000 BTC from a tumbler, it is pretty easy to figure out that the two transactions are related. This is why you are supposed to break it up into smaller amounts and distribute it across multiple wallets. This person did not do that effectively.

A prosecutor can NEVER use the fact that you retained a lawyer against you. And in case you haven't been around the system for long most criminal lawyers hang around criminals all day long. ITS THEIR JOB. Its up to the lawyer to figure out if he wants you as a client or not. If he takes you on and doesn't do his homework and later on its revealed that you were committing crimes while being retained then he can be sanctioned by his bar. The prosecutor can then bring up the fact that you were dumped by your lawyer and you've retained a new one. Still that's not much of a strike against you.  Some people are lifelong criminals. They never stop committing crimes even when represented. If it were illegal to retain a lawyer while  potentially committing a crime then there would be quite a few people who would be left without lawyers.

My understanding: Asic miners are becoming more popular, contributing to the decentralization of mining. As more coins are mined, the difficulty of mining coins increases.  Because of this increasing decentralization and-as a result-difficulty, the payoff is not as it used to be. I think those that mine, unless they have hefty setups, and I mean hefty, mostly do it as a hobby, knowing that the return of their investment is unlikely. ",""

Gox is the exchange that has suffered the most over the past few days, due to a number of factors, said Antonopoulos. One problem is that it was using a custom client (not the core Bitcoin software), on top of that there is the DDoS attack, plus it was using an automated system to approve withdrawals.âThis is not happening to other exchanges because theyâre not stupid enough to issue withdrawals without checking them out first,â he explained.Antonopoulos said we will see a few exchanges suspend withdrawals temporarily while they re-work their accounting systems to ensure they are not confused by the attack.âItâs important to note no funds have been lost. Withdrawals have been halted to prevent funds from being lost or to prevent the balances from going out of sync,â he stressed.Industry actionAn industry-wide coordinated response has been put into action, with exchanges and core developers collaborating actively to attack the problem from multiple angles.Various other groups within the ecosystem, including the big mining pools, are working to stop the issue from propagating across the network.Any exchanges that are affected are working on fixing their internal systems so they correct the account balances and can resume withdrawals as soon as possible.âI would expect to see withdrawals flowing again within 24 and 72 hours, and in the meantime, any withdrawals that were cancelled will reappear in customer account balances,â Antonopoulos explained.Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik said the core bitcoin block chain consensus mechanism and payment system are continuing to work as before, and are not directly impacted by transaction malleability.He added: âWeb wallets and other services that build services on top of bitcoin are reporting problems similar to MtGox, and are taking safety measures to ensure no fund loss, during this network disruption.âYesterdayâs statement must be revised:  we will likely issue an update fixing two edge cases exposed by this attack.âBitstamp has issued a statement explaining that it has temporarily halted BTC withdrawals. It begins:Bitstampâs exchange software is extremely cautious concerning Bitcoin transactions. Currently it has suspended processing Bitcoin withdrawals due to inconsistent results reported by our bitcoind wallet, caused by a denial-of-service attack using transaction malleability to temporarily disrupt balance checking. As such, Bitcoin withdrawal processing will be suspended temporarily until a software fix is issued.The statement goes on to reveal that no funds have been lost, nor are any at risk.BTC-e later issued a comment via Twitter, elaborating on its service interruption.Due DDOS on Bitcoin network there is a delay possible with crediting of transactions madden between 10-11 February. Be patient please #btce â BTC-E (@btcecom) February 11, 2014 Donât panicAntonopoulos was keen to stress that, although this is a serious attack, it doesnât spell the end of bitcoin. He believes the DDoS attack will be âthwartedâ and exchanges will be running as usual by Friday.âI expect things will go back to normal and the honey badger of money can continue showing its resilience,â he said.âThe death of bitcoin has been prematurely announced so many times already that the obvious conclusion is that bitcoin is far more resilient than its critics would like to think.

They didn't find drugs on his person or in his home. Without drugs there is no drugs case. Text messages are only text messages. On their own, useless evidence.

What else have they got on your mate?They charged him with distribution of marijuana, and possession of a schedule one substance. They did not find anything on him. They raided a house that he used to live in and found miniscule amounts of drugs and the guy living there said it was my friends. So, they went and arrested him, and got his phone. I dont know what all he said in the texts, all I know is he seemed pretty nervous about it. That is all the evidence they have on him."

No probable cause to enter your mate's house and no drugs. Where's the case?! If that's all they have go down to your local bookmaker and stick a lot of money on him not being indicted    Have you seen him since he went inside? You sure he didn't open his mouth during questioning? The main question is though, why did they raid the other house in the first place? Police don't raid houses without good reason. There must have been some sort of surveillance that involved your friend. There just has to be something else. They may not have disclosed their intelligence yet and that's why you think that's all they have on him.   Either way, I still can't see how he can be indicted, even if they have more on him. No drugs, no indictment. For his sake I hope I'm right.   Best of luck mate. ","Its my best friend man, and I was there when he got arrested. That is ALL they have on him.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","636","2013-10-14T19:54:43","Basic tor over public wifi question","Discussion/Security","Assuming everything's working properly, sniffing Wifi traffic from a laptop running Whonix should show someone: 1. Whatever traffic is coming from the laptop aside from the Tor-ified traffic from Whonix. 2. Connections from Whonix (from a network perspective, it's from your laptop) will look like Tor traffic from the Whonix gateway to its entry guards or it's bridges, depending on which way you're connecting.  3. That's it.  Tor traffic is encrypted and will not contain strings from the data you're sending over it.  Your DNS queries should be going over Tor from the Whonix Workstation if Whonix is working properly.  Which leaves you with a handful of explanations: 1. Whonix isn't working properly.  Either the Whonix Workstation or the Whonix Gateway isn't working..you can get into the why of it, but I'd download a fresh copy of both before I spent a lot of time troubleshooting it.   Off the top of my head, I can't think of a way to even *intentionally* misconfigure Whonix to let you both actually *get* to .onion sites and leake traffic to the Internet (Wifi).  If you accidentally changed the Workstation's virtual adapter, it shouldn't get to .onion sites anymore.  Verify the signatures if you re-download Whonix, it's worth the effort. 2. Your laptop has something else on it that's sending traffic containing the string ""silkroad"".  No clue what that might be.   3. Your laptop is somehow trying to look up a silkroadwhatever.onion address from *outside* of Whonix via DNS.  This is my bet, BTW, if #4 isn't true.  Home internet gateways often rely on DNS blocking of records to keep the kids away from the dirty pictures, and that's the only logical place I can think your friend saw it. 4. Your friend is fucking with you, and wanted to see your reaction after seeing shit in the news.  Or his home gateway recognized Tor traffic (very doubtful) as ""Tor"" traffic, and he decided to take a flyer and see what you'd say. 5. Longshot here, but maybe a mobile device that you have configured to connect to that Wifi. You don't have an Android device running Orbot, right?  Just in case the thing in your pocket is your problem.  If so, it's more likely to leak lots of things than Whonix is.  Tor traffic is identifible as Tor traffic with a little work (it's easy to identify by hand, but harder to do programatically at a content-level), but the traffic actually *inside* it is encrypted.  So seeing that you're using Tor isn't hard for someone who is really trying, but seeing where you're going is nearly impossible.  That's the point of it.

In fact, I'm simply looking out for the safety of our community. This user may be false, but, I personally did what this user had done (followed his steps) and have gotten the same results. Its more of a warning, rather then a proof.  Hell, I could be wrong, but do you see what I'm saying? Its much better to be safe then sorry. As a resultnof last weeks seizure, I believe everyone should be more cautious, and always assume the worst could be happening at all times. (Such as LE running these sites.  Here's a random idea:  Sheep market opened 7 months ago (no idea when, I know its been awhile though). Guess what, surprise! Its actually been designed and run by LE. I've read countless times, that the feds for example, have patience. On top of that, they calculate everything. Lets say, they figure they will take SR down in September, well, by then, Sheep would have been online for months prior to this seizure - doesn't that make things LOOK BETTER? Of course it does. Perhaps they recongized the facts ahead of time and realized that even if SR were to be compromised - they still wouldn't be able to bust the sites larger-scale users, or users for short. By having Sheep somewhat recongized, and having it online monthsprior, would be pretty smart on their part, don't you think?  ^^ I certainly hope that isn't true. I made this up as I went along. Ithis is just an example of potential risks and why YOU should be extremely cautious at all times.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","StevieHyperD","23025","2014-02-07T22:16:01","Localbitcoins now requiring photo ID for large purchases?","Discussion/Security","I thinhk its due to a couple of guys in Miami being charged with money laundering today.  https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/  State authorities in Florida on Thursday announced criminal charges targeting three men who allegedly ran illegal businesses moving large amounts of cash in and out of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.  Working in conjunction with the Miami Beach Police Department and the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs office, undercover officers and agents from the U.S. Secret Serviceâs Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via localbitcoins.com, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.  One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed âMichelhack.â According to this userâs profile, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in todayâs value), and a 99 percent positive âfeedbackâ score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.  According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.  Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to 30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Floridaâs law against unlicensed money transmitters â which prohibits âcurrency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month periodâ â and Floridaâs anti-money laundering statutes, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.  Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is Pascal Reid, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as proy33 on localbitcoins.com, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.  Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone â which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy credit cards stolen in the Target breach.  Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and at the University of California, Berkeley and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.  âThe biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because itâs always hard to buy Bitcoins,â Weaver said. âThe reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible â namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.â  One very popular method of quickly purchasing Bitcoins â BitInstant â was shuttered last year. Last month, BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem was arrested for money laundering, following allegations that he helped a man in Florida convert more than a million dollars in Bitcoins for use on the online drug bazaar Silk Road.  Itâs still unclear how the defendants Espinoza and Reid were able to obtain so many Bitcoins for sale, although a review of Michelhackâs profile suggests little more than arbitrage â that is, buying Bitcoins for $700 apiece and selling them for a couple hundred dollars more.  There is nothing that links either defendant to the Silk Road trade. But itâs notable that a third individual charged with money laundering as part of this investigation â 28-year-old Canadian citizen Vincente Loyola â is currently serving a 12-month sentence at a U.S. federal detention center for narcotics trafficking.  In any case, Weaver said he anticipates that more states will soon seek to crack down on high-dollar Bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins.com. âIâd expect many more state cases like this one because it will act to strangle the lifeblood of the online dark markets,â such as Silk Road, Weaver said. âIf you want a significant amount of anonymous Bitcoins, right now this community is about the only mechanism still available.â  News of the Florida actions comes on the heels of the arraignment of Ross Ulbricht â the alleged onetime owner of the Silk Road. Ulbricht was scheduled to be arraigned in New York today.  The court documents in this case also offer a great example of the traceability of Bitcoin transactions â a potential danger for both those seeking anonymous payments and for law enforcement officials posing as criminals as part of an undercover investigation. The ICSIâs Weaver noted that, by examining the times and transactions in the criminal complaint, it appears that this is the Bitcoin wallet associated with the undercover officer.",""

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive. Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.

Can I do anything?","Discussion/Security","Hello everyone I have a question I have a bitcoin wallet with a significant amount of coins that has passed through it. Unfortunately, I also have it linked with a personal email. Which I use for a ton of shit. I'm considering writing the email off and deleting, and hoping I can get the 5yr clause where they can't use it against you after a certain time. This is a tad bit significant considering I used to be a vendor. This was back before that period however and I am certain it's only associated with a old SR 1 customer account.  I have gone over the address's and I see maybe 1 BTC that made it through to SR. That might be just enough to get caught. So I don't wanna risk it for the biscuit. I realized that SR has a built in tumbler but I don't know if that had been implemented.   Do I have any options.   Most of the coins that went through were before they were worth a lot but now upwards of 70k.   I have ceased all operations for about half a year and I'm completely redone as far as opsec. Its scary how one mistake in the past can potentially get you caught up.  Thanks for the advice in advanced.",""

THE Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) says Customs' seizure of 67,123 prohibited imports represented around 13 per cent of potential prohibited imports.  In a 2012 report on its own performance, Customs cited the increasing number of successful seizures of contraband and concluded that this demonstrated ""low level of leakage of a small number of prohibited imports of a minor nature."" But the ANAO said Customs really didn't know as it had never calculated its leakage rate - done by sampling cleared mail items. ANAO did its own calculations and estimated Customs missed 467,893 prohibited items in 2012-13. ""Customs' high estimated leakage rate, particularly in unscreened non-letter class mail would suggest that Customs' screening activities miss a large number of prohibited imports,"" it said. ANAO acknowledged screening was a challenging job. In 2012-13, Australia Post reported that around 180 million international mail items arrived in Australia. Over the last five years, parcels have increased 200 per cent with the rise in online shopping. Most pose no threat but some contain drugs, guns and risky plant or animal products. International mail arrives at four Australia Post gateway facilities in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth where it's screened by Customs and Agriculture visually and by x-ray scanners and sniffer dogs. Where previously everything was screened, it's now done according to risk assessment. Since 2006-07 the number of items screened by Agriculture has reduced by 76 per cent and 45 per cent for Customs. The government provided funding this year to increase the screening rate. ANAO said Customs described its targeting approach as ""intelligence-led and risk-based"". But in practice targeting decisions were often not documented and did not align with risk analysis, providing little assura",""

Online products = common method = cops are more likely to know about it.  Regardless of the method you settle on, for the love of God, please don't use a hollowed out book or a soda can with screw-on base     I can neither confirm nor deny that I have ever done the following:  - Find a door that isn't solid wood; unscrew the screws of the door handles.  - Find an rope or line that's of appropriate strength and length. You may find spiral coiled plastic, the sort you'd find on a keyring is good, but I suppose fishing line would work. - Attach contraband to the end of the line any way you see fit; on the other end create a small loop or use a keyring loop - Lower the contraband into the hollow of the door; practice raising and lowering to ensure everything is kosher and nothing gets caught  - Now this is a bit hard to describe without a picture: oftentimes a door handle will have two thin rods that go from one side of the door to the other. These rods are used to connect one handle to the other handle. With one door handle removed, this is a perfect place to attach the loop.  - Reattach the door handle and re-screw in place. - This may not be suitable if you have a significant amount of contraband as it will alter acoustics if anybody has suspicions. You can test this by percussing, by splaying out your hand and using your middle finger as a pleximeter as shown here:  http://img.tfd.com/mk/P/X2604-P-16.png   ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","I852CD1","517","2013-10-13T10:06:12","Everything Decentralized and Modular","Discussion/Security","Ill apologize in advance as Im a bit ""Cronked"", maybe this idea is a little off. But Ive been rolling it around in my head now for awhile, and I figured I would throw it out there.  It seems that the centralized marketplaces MAY be more vulnerable than anticipated. First Atlantis fell, and then shortly thereafter SR succumbed to the powers that be. I imagine that there is significant threat to BMR, SR, and DeepBay as well. It makes sense that ANY central server would be susceptible to government seizure, given the right circumstances.   Since the 90's the Feds have been unable to stop P2P torrents. Further, electronic currency is not illegal. My idea stems from these two concepts.   The first idea is based on the concept of a very wide and unpredictable server base. Basically hiding a portable website within the P2P network. Hiding in plain site really, no encryption needed. Thousands of hosts/seeds, with every seed an opportunity for a small business. Each seed an individual entity, maintained by that individual and collecting a small fee to list each vendor that advertises in their P2P file. The Seeder count being the ultimate feedback of legitimacy. A thousand accounts on a thousand different servers.  The second idea that goes hand in hand with the first. Is to use independent escrow services. These are already out there for BTC. Though admittedly I have never used any of them. A handful of entities that are willing to create a generic agreement for escrow, and resolution issues would do the trick. Basic agreed upon terminology that poses little risk to the escrow agent, and yet serves the purpose would be in order of course.  While Im sure my idea has flaws and can be improved upon, I think that it may be a valid idea. Anything that can open up the free market, and leave the Gov guessing, is a step in the right direction. Ill also add that I am technologically inept in a lot of ways, and would in no way be fit to start such a service (though I would vend through one.)  So what do you think? Discuss. Is this a stupid idea?",""

His system uses multiple nodes. I wonder whether a mass-hosted P2P system wouldn't work better - although there are a few issues with that: 1. site content is dynamic rather than static, so files (such as product databases) need to be regularly updated across the system. 2. need a way of preventing malicious nodes disrupting the system. 3. needs to be hosted on a large enough p2p cloud that nodes are safe from prosecution (would not be the case if they received payment from illegal transactions) - possibly if the network was like Freenet where not everyone hosting the site necessarily has anything to do with it (though Freenet only works for static content).",""

There would still be risk to the buyers, but minimum risk to the sellers. (Assuming appropriate basic security.) But then again, there will always be some risk when buying illegal items.  But if the sellers use anonymous email accounts, and PGP encryption the risks to the sellers would be minimal. And since the buyers are giving out there physical address anyway the current risk really remains about the same.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Ketatmine","162","2013-10-10T00:47:19","Anonymous Markets- The Road To Decriminalization.","Discussion/Legal","Maybe, I believe it's our best chance though...  These markets have already been likened to filesharing, the idea that grew so popular and it's use so widespread the authorities/music labels had no choice but to get on top of it and provide a legal alternative.   I believe this was DPRs vision but before we can get there hurdles will obviously be faced.   Crucially we need more people using anonymous markets. I know some people will disagree with this, with suggestions of closed forums and invite only markets, this is selfish and will not further the cause. You cannot keep LE out of these places so why try. When the majority are buying their drugs online we might then stand a chance of decriminalization. Obviously sites of the future will need to handle additional users, decentralization will help with this and is probably the future.  Anonymous markets have been growing but to grow further we need to ensure ease of use whilst maintaining safety. I suspect the majority of us are fairly geeky, not full on but enough that we spent the time learning encryption, finding coins, posting on forums etc... I imagine the majority are not willing to spend the time learning, I know this has put many off. Coins are easy to buy non anonymously and PGP isn't necessary but everyone needs to be safe. As bitcoin grows to be more accepted for legitimate uses this will become easier, will it ever grow to be that legitimate though? Perhaps this needs more focus? PGP is easy but can appear hard, can this be made to appear simpler? It needs to be less hassle to order online than to ring a dealer and wait for him to arrive, quality and safety arguments aside.  Anonymous markets makes taking drugs viable to so many more people, small town folk, high ranking professionals, celebrities? etc...but you know this. I still feel however there is stigma attached to buying drugs, the media is mostly to blame I feel. Focus on how anonymous buying eliminates violent crime is perhaps needed? Slick webpages with professional vendors and customer support help remove the stigma, if it looks like a normal legal market it will help people feel more at home. This is why SR was great. To help further, maybe these markets should offer legitimate items. Just make it a normal online market, that's anonymous, where you can also buy drugs. I think kmfkewm proposed this for his decentralized market place he was talking about. Maybe we need to aim to be an alternative to Amazon? We should distance ourselves from weapons and CP, they will only hinder. Also, no more DoD/HH/Coachella/ other unprofessional 'vendors' running their mouth off, chatting shit, this only alienates normal folk. No idea how to stop this though, not having a forum linked to the market perhaps?  Essentially anonymous markets need to be more accessible and seen to be of limited risk.  The media is perhaps our greatest problem, or greatest ally? The majority will believe what the papers tell them. In a way DPR was smart to talk to the media, though I would've done it differently. A spokesperson who could talk to the media (maybe on behalf of DPR) effectively would help. Reporters will be eager to get exclusive statements; I propose give them one sentence that's direct, to the point and only focuses on the good. This means they can print only the good with no chance for 'creative' manipulation of the quote.    As more people buy drugs online more pressures will be placed on discovering packages, stealth will improve as will detection techniques. Will we get to the point where we need to look at a private delivery service or other alternatives? Would this even ever be at all viable?   I'll stop rambling and leave you with this,  TL:DR The more people buying drugs online the closer we are to decriminalization. How to get more people on board?    ",""

I gave him a name from one of my fake ID's.

But my judgement got the better of me and I kept my mouth shut.    Another laughable thing, I visited my mother the other day and there was a bit on the radio about the SR seizure.

During the conversation, one of the guys asked us:  ""Have you guys ever heard of the DEEP web?""  I then explained to them that yes, I had heard of the deep web, and in fact I ordered all of my drugs from a deep web site called Silk Road. I tried to explain to them how SR worked and how there is almost no risk if you are just ordering personal amounts, but they didn't seem to understand me. It probably didn't help that I was borderline blackout drunk too...  Anyway, I feel this goes to show how mainstream SR has become in society. Whenever I bring it up in conversation to a stranger, 9 out of 10 times the person knows what I'm talking about.

I understand that (and I believe that US law is now the same), but Emory was selling  viable seeds.  That would make sense. It's not exactly a secret that Vancouver, and more loosely British Columbia (and possibly the rest of Canada--I can't speak to that) is tolerant toward marijuana within it's borders.  One of my friends was arrested at the US border for trying to bring 1g of bud back from Vancouver, which is a harsher punishment (importing) than simple possession is in the United States (also, it falls under Federal law; each state has it's own enforcement policies, with many having long ago decriminalized simple possession).   And  once you start exporting, it becomes more problematic, particularly if you are also violating Canadian law at the same time. It's difficult to fight extradition in that case.  Marc Emory was raided by and arrested by Canadian authorities, and the Canadian legal system ordered him to be extradited to the US to face trial.  We're not talking about sterilized seeds (or Cannabis Ruderalis even, which grows wild, and uncontrolled in the United States--we call it ditch weed; it's the only remaining signs of the former US hemp industry).  These seeds (i.e. Emory's) were meant to be germinated. I didn't ask what Pete's were for, because it's not only none of my business, but I believe he also knows better than to incriminate himself publicly (since his nick is known to the authorities), so I wouldn't have expected (or wanted) an answer.

Arriving in the US on 13 July 2006 they eventually pled guilty to wire fraud in a plea bargain.     Babar Ahmad - awaiting extradition on charges of running web sites supporting the Chechen and Afghan insurgencies whilst in the UK     Syed Talha Ahsan - aspergers sufferer awaiting extradition on charges of running web sites supporting the Chechen and Afghan insurgencies whilst in the UK, defendant of Babar Ahmad     Abu Hamza al-Masri - extradited to the US on 5 October 2012, amongst other things accused of conspiring with convicted American terrorist James Ujaama whilst in the UK.     Alex Stone - alleged child abuse, charges subsequently dropped after 6 months in US jail. According to Mr. Stone ""there appeared to be no defence to extradition and no evidence at all was presented in this case"".[22]     Ian Norris of Morgan Crucible - alleged price fixing (whilst in the UK and price fixing was not a crime in the UK at the time). Extradition overturned by the House of Lords on appeal.[23] Subsequent extradition request on obstruction of justice charges approved in July 2008,[24] extradited March 2010.[25]     Wojciech Chodan and Jeffrey Tesler - face extradition over their alleged role in a Nigerian bribery scandal, but argue that almost none of the misconduct they are accused of was connected to the US and that the alleged bribery plot took place mainly in the UK or Nigeria.[26][27]     Richard O'Dwyer - extradition request made in May 2011.

Rent one in the same country as you, pay in coins, use a dedicated email address (only accessed over tor) - that will get you 1 anonymous VPS. Never connect to it directly (at this stage) - always via Tor.  Install Tor on the VPS (not TBB but Tor)   Add the following lines to the Tor config file (/etc/tor/torrc usually)   ORPort 443DirPort 80RelayBandwidthRate 100KBRelayBandwidthBurst 200KBNickname MyTrustyRelayRunAsDaemon 1 Restart  - leave the box up now and don't touch it again unless you really need to  Wait a few weeks - check your relay to make sure it gets the guard flag https://atlas.torproject.org/#search/MyTrustyRelay   (change the relay name to whatever you set it to)  Then you are ready to use it as a guard.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","kr-rypt","2731","2013-11-10T17:14:12","Microchips And China.","Discussion/Security","Taken from gizmodo. ""A weird thing happened in St. Petersburg last week. The Russian press reports that local officials intercepted a shipment from China that contained home appliances with ""spy"" microchips capable of spreading malware to wi-fi enabled devices within 200 meters. Tea kettles were apparently the chief culprit.  Specific details of the dodgy shipments remain shady. It's unclear, for example, if the chips were installed by the Chinese or by cyber criminals en route to Russia. It's also unclear how Russian authorities spotted the contraband in the first place, although one report claims that the weight of some shipments were slightly off. Finally, the extent of the fiasco is also unclear, though limited press coverage suggests that it's contained to a small shipment in St. Petersburg.  While the story seems ridiculous enough to second-guess the local press reports, as The Register argues, the story appears to check out. The publication confirms the details in a report from the RosBalt press agency, quoting one customs official from Panimport, as well as the employee of the appliance company who found originally the bugged devices. It's also entirely possible to build spy chips small enough to be implanted in a household appliance and powerful enough to connect to local wi-fi networks. The detail about a difference in weight of the shipment might seem a little more suspect, but we don't know exactly how big or heavy these chips really are.  The ultimate question remains: Why on Earth was somebody sending appliances implanted with spy chips to St. Petersburg? This is real James Bond territory, except there's no clear target or mission. It's possible that local authorities were mistaken about what they found. After all, Wi-fi-enabled tea kettles do actually exist.

Does anyone know the safety of using these devices? I can buy the credit anonymously and there is nothing to connect me to the device. It is registered and active.  If I were using this to access TOR/ Silkroad would that bring attention to the account? What if I were to connect to a VPN and then TOR? Is there anyway that the connection can be physically located over the mobile network if authorities were to look investigate this account?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","one.top","1803","2013-11-01T08:23:19","Is it safe- Prepaid Moblie Internet","Discussion/Security"," I would be using this connection solely for use on Tor and never clearnet. Infact I would only be using it to access this forum and the marketplace itself.  My worry that it could be traced because the simcard is obviously registered to a false name or to someone who does not know it has been registered to them. If the provider was to discover that this was a false account they could be calling the police to investigate. If the police could geographically locate where the simcard was being used Id be fucked basically. So I am questioning whether it is a good idea or not.  On the positive side I have an internet connection that is not in my name, that no one else is aware of and I do not have to use a home connection or go to a public wi-fi which Im not keen on.  On the down side I do not know how well hidden the connection would be if LE were trying to geographically locate it. Obviously they could determine an area it is connecting to the network but Im in a heavily populated area so that would give me some cover. Id rather they were not looking for to begin with and they may well never be. Id just rather know that if they were they could not locate the simcard down to who's door they need to break down.   Im going to keep this idea on the shelf till I know for certain. I am very keen on an anonymous internet connection but not one that can be located if the shit goes down.","http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/04/verizon-rigmaiden-aircard/all/QuoteCourt documents in a case involving accused identity thief Daniel David Rigmaiden describe how the wireless provider reached out remotely to reprogram an air card the suspect was using in order to make it communicate with the governmentâs surveillance tool so that he could be located.Rigmaiden, who is accused of being the ringleader of a $4 million tax fraud operation, asserts in court documents that in July 2008 Verizon surreptitiously reprogrammed his air card to make it respond to incoming voice calls from the FBI and also reconfigured it so that it would connect to a fake cell site, or stingray, that the FBI was using to track his location.This whole court case was pretty interesting, this guy, 'Daniel Rigmaiden' was a complete buffoon nutjob you should read the entire info on how they caught him.

Similarly you will be able to encrypt and verify using it.   I would like to make the details of this code mod available to others: (note:  I worked with the source code for gnupg-1.4.16 for cygwin on windows However, i suspect it's substantively the same on linux and mac).  1.  In the ""configure"" file, under the section 'Initializations.' I changed the default build location to avoid  vandalising my pre-existing gpg installation. My change is labelled 'PLAYGROUND MOD',  the original value is labelled 'PLAYGROUND ORIG:'.        #       # Initializations.       #        # PLAYGROUND MOD       ac_default_prefix=~/gnupg-1.4.16/usr/local       # PLAYGROUND ORIG: ac_default_prefix=/usr/local        ac_clean_files=       ac_config_libobj_dir=.  2.  in the g10/ directory there is a file named keygen.c in this file there    is a function named ask_keysize(int algo, unsigned int primary_keysize),    within, is a switch function as shown below.      (My changes are labelled 'PLAYGROUND MOD',     the original values are labelled 'PLAYGROUND ORIG:').             switch(algo)          {          case PUBKEY_ALGO_DSA:            def=2048;            max=3072;            break;           case PUBKEY_ALGO_RSA:             // PLAYGROUND MOD             min=3072;             max=8192;             def=4096;             // PLAYGROUND ORIG: min=1024;             // PLAYGROUND ORIG: {max was not specified here}             // PLAYGROUND ORIG: {def was not specified here}            break;          }  That's it, no other changes were made.  If i do a recursive grep for PLAYGROUND from the top level  of the source i see these results:  $ grep -n -r PLAYGROUND * configure:572:# PLAYGROUND MOD configure:574:# PLAYGROUND ORIG: ac_default_prefix=/usr/local g10/keygen.c:1605:      // PLAYGROUND MOD g10/keygen.c:1609:      // PLAYGROUND ORIG: min=1024; g10/keygen.c:1610:      // PLAYGROUND ORIG: {max was not specified here} g10/keygen.c:1611:      // PLAYGROUND ORIG: {def was not specified here}  Satisfyingly simple.     Note: Don't forget: PATH=~/gnupg-1.4.16/usr/local/bin:$PATH  Below is the 8192 bit public key.  This key has the email address: bigKey.8192@playground.info Below that is a sample file which has been clear signed. I would be grateful if you could import the key and then verify the signature.  And then perhaps encrypt a message back to  me using the 8192 Key... that would be very helpful :-)  have a nice day ...

tomsguide.com/us/encryption-nsa-edward-snowden-rsa-ssl,news-17503.html  As Schneier points out, most of the Internet is phasing out 1024-bit RSA keys for 2048-bit keys (the smallest is 128-bit). That means brute force might yield a decrypted message ""once every million years"". He suggests that the Internet jump right into 3072-bit keys and use key lengths above 500 bits.  The latest scare stems from 50,000 leaked documents provided by Snowden. The NSA's highly classified encryption cracking program is called Bullrun, and has supposedly foiled top encryption methods Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Virtual Private Networks (VPN), and encryption used on 4G smartphones. This program, until now, was only known by top NSA officials and counterpart agencies in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  The documents also show that the NSA is still having issues with strong, non-commercial encryption systems such as Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP. They also claim that the agency has actually deployed custom-built computers designed to break encryption. Schneier theorizes these could be quantum computers capable of performing the heavy calculations, but highly unlikely. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1  iQQcBAEBCgAGBQJTPfceAAoJEKNl+IRav5X36logAKBRDP0BgO6twrXXS1uolf4/ G2gKvViaq3uzVz/jcM6eOsktoOVCLm5FwmnE74X2oJDGrUY6hqb4uWjovwvrLset StVEuQdQFF1v/39Ri1UxhyUmXf2obBT5y0m2kGlYc32F8i8h2R08UP1PmTPKXI44 1rTTXVIv3W74JdISyXM+uCZgej4rh9rN6vYtsxCnkw+y2IkQKtD47YMBPUidhNH/ ZIK4Or/6HhpiJts+9wNpG8FYD1DpVlNbY8cQfLQpEj1sJwEoRz/4lLYnXtk4NNKH jXV/nmLKRvJ9x3SfLIWQYJr/QJOEA5jNB6cWbD3+Q+IQZyy5Rsns52mFjtEcEHXA qLr0lQTdkBCXjK39yvxpyxDhkllpIdP8UXy0pqoIbPfrj9K078WPeWO3dBRhnnoe MFrNi7k3OCX3R292SxFLqAyZCRsqgKBHBro7onbbsz2xhgfg3nXecfrv2BBWNwr3 dvZDOPcQ0adfIXoBK/ngcDBiQjQ6rJr2h2RLcB0ebcOUOK7XRsCXH29pgOQBCL4F cijltFUBvRIzHmReMEOqNE+mPZP9NZBUG6NagOhtpfUvnmbq9WP03jnTdHNa3erB 1ei8j3dPjXXy1TCNBCJtYJZ84Hq2f5Xmt5WcKqGVM2J5Tt5MlTvd/2s/FnLvi2JY GeBwpduGWZaTRRAInhJD5sNgPSP1wZp0tyQ9JXtyIwh+YLFHfO2sPxSc0AIM7EsZ 0QimBhm2MYw855yE1ScNAZw8fOeH3mAcjAEWsIJZTGtQH7Hk8niflmSKlqZrmBJu dHoXohlOIQIC8CncW1GIwsahsnEqh2Yrwytfg1z2gMnZwcm9FpNpjgDrU+PojkjX p50LuyMmazF2LQ7HlU7SREwIKEt0yHirZtYafaQVajBZedj8TlxwsCkWA+xNqnn+ jU6IY+96HOBUHCVGh0WvJ3drVnjnBRytUX8RDJCjpZDfC/Qs2DTPSzYObQC7zK2i X6UvcqObJmLNKrk0LP3NFeWrqgqHCICyxfANxmMnyZDNcXqdjjx6Wr1YHTcVEltq LvvBbrMMcsMtypEgVhE0h8JV6zMcHCyaCkSA9Ec+Dj5gzPCYKu550zz92bOTtIsB QuNGcbBXRVITQDWWasykOqil4duNihUU5fDji4QZ/L56LZdgSNNIcd5DbQCtbcaP 9IlV2oV9nllq1L4Qt9mf3HVqJ3nNwMYrARn6zR2GGoJF/fRtiLP1I1EZMRBKYdE/ eRMcwwZYbTtHN1DZwdnkEL7NYOSAa8wbHaQa+UZ8uYVS++9nOkOv4Z8msLo247RG aw9+Wu8zjFf0uzkyWhysQ6CXjHk45lbAIMeZCpsVxvGBDvahwlgckLGI58H9JDw= =Btfj -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ",""

You'll have to wait 72 hours for it. alas.  I think your decision to go for 4096 bit key is a good one. And i may yet decide to follow you down that road.  Time will tell. The problem, it seems to me, is that we don't know how extensive is the back door that the NSA bought from RSA for $10 million. It's supposedly involves the use of a particular random number generator. One supplied by the NSA to help them crack encryption more easily. We know definitely that they can crack 1024 bit keys... and SSL. And we also know they have specialised hardware for the task. So can they crack 2048 bit keys ?  We don't know. Bruce Scheiner is suggesting that we adopt 3072 bit keys. So i think the adoption of 4096 bit keys is .. err... prudent.  However we don't know what the future will bring. Nightcrawler, before his regrettable departure, had a line in his sig pointing out that the sins of today, can visit you tomorrow. If the NSA / LEO figures out quantum computing ... in five years time.. perhaps ten... or if the aliens land and  explain an easily algorithm for solving prime factorisation.. or whatever. Then perhaps our warm, reassuring complacency with 2048 or 4096 keys will turn into a convenient reason for filling yet another private prison in the American mid-west:  Dark Web Correctional Facility, perhaps.   have a nice day.. and be happy :-)  playground.","Good work playground, although after extensive research and testing I've come to the conclusion that others have - anything above 4096 bit RSA encryption is kind of redundant, and unless we adopt a new algorithm for asymmetric cryptography (such as Dual Elliptic Curve), 4096 bit will probably be the standard for the next few decades or so (or until the NSA breaks it)."

The point of diminishing returns happens around RSA-2048. Once you move past RSA-2048, youâre really not gaining very much. At the same time, moving past RSA-2048 means you lose the ability to migrate your certificate to a smartcard, or to effectively use it on some mobile devices, or to interoperate with other OpenPGP applications that donât handle large keys gracefully.  Even the devs reckon you don't need RSA-4096 (overkill):   Ref: http://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#no_default_of_rsa4096","11.3 Why doesnât GnuPG default to using RSA-4096?Because it gives us almost nothing, while costing us quite a lot.Breaking an RSA-10 key requires you to try each prime number between two and one hundred. There are twenty-five of these, meaning RSA-10 is equivalent to about a 5-bit symmetric cipher. Breaking an RSA-20 key requires you to try each prime number between two and one thousand: there are 168 of them, meaning RSA-20 is equivalent to about an 8-bit cipher. Doubling the keylength (from RSA-10 to RSA-20) didn't give us the benefit that we naively expected. Each additional bit gives correspondingly less in the way of additional security, and we quickly reach a point of diminishing returns.That point of diminishing returns happens around RSA-2048. Once you move past RSA-2048, youâre really not gaining very much. At the same time, moving past RSA-2048 means you lose the ability to migrate your certificate to a smartcard, or to effectively use it on some mobile devices, or to interoperate with other OpenPGP applications that donât handle large keys gracefully.If you really want a 4096-bit RSA key thereâs nothing stopping you: but we sincerely believe the overwhelming majority of users will be well-served with RSA-2048.11.4 Why do people advise against using RSA-4096?Almost always when people use 4096-bit RSA theyâre doing so because they believe RSA-4096 to be much stronger than it is. The United Statesâ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) states that RSA-2048 gives roughly 112 bits of security and RSA-3072 gives roughly 128. There is no formal recommendation on where RSA-4096 lies, but the general consensus is that it would come in somewhere around 140 bits â 28 bits of improvement over RSA-2048. This is an improvement so marginal that itâs really not worth mentioning.If you need more security than RSA-2048 offers, the way to go would be to switch to elliptical curve cryptography â not to continue using RSA.11.5 Why does GnuPG support RSA-4096 if itâs such a bad idea?RSA-4096 is not a bad idea: itâs just, generally speaking, unnecessary. You gain very little in the way of additional resistance to brute-forcing and cryptanalysis."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Anti-Hero","33243","2014-03-23T05:19:32","My new 16384 bit PGP key","Discussion/Security","The point being that the point of diminishing returns happens around RSA-2048 is because that is where it is most optimal to use this algorithm in terms of strength to time ratio and the larger the bit keylengths generated beyond this point the higher the exponentially reduced cryptography rate.  For example, to brute-force an RSA 2048-bit key (128-bit cipher strength):   Even if in 50 years time when they have heaps more powerful ""super-computers"", they could only possibly reduce the time taken for the above to occur by millions of years at a time, at best. And when it takes ""10,000,000,000,000 years"" to crack a cipher strength 128-bit RSA-2048 key with the impossible scenario mentioned above (using a billiion chips that can do a billion keys per second), it's obviously a non-issue for sometime to come. You and all your family of gererations to come will already be dead before they even are able to get close to compromising such algorithms.  So, you're basically paying in encryption/decryption time it takes to compute using keys larger than RSA-2048 (128-bit cipher) as the efficiency limit has been reached at this point, for this algorithm. New technology algorithms will prevail over significantly increasing the RSA keylength for highly diminishing gains. Hell, all of the world's top, most secure IRL banks ""only"" use RSA-2048 keys currently, and I'd bet they'd change their crypto technology entirely before they'd increase the keylengths of RSA keys...","If you use at least a cipher strength of 128-bit (~2048-bit RSA) PGP key, the time needed for computation and heat released by a computer that brute-forced a 128-bit cipher produces results that are profoundly silly: itâs enough to boil the oceans and leave the planet as a charred, smoking ruin.So, not everything that can be encrypted can be decrypted.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jolly Roger","33243","2014-03-23T07:38:23","My new 16384 bit PGP key","Discussion/Security","I really do not have the time or energy to get into a debate here but currently on average a 2048 bit RSA key can be decrypted with the corresponding private key in about 175 - 225 milliseconds.   A 4096 bit RSA key can be decrypted with the private key in about 1 second. So yes, every time you double the key length, it takes you between 6-7 times longer to decrypt the key on a 2 GHZ pentium processor. I assume most people have this at a minimum by now.   The only time this longer decryption time really becomes a problem is when you are decrypting keys on the fly on, for example a web server. An attacker could then start flooding the server with encrypted messages and gobble up all the CPU power.   Since most of us decrypt on our computer, even if you happen to make the jump up to 8192 bit RSA keys, you are talking about a 6-7 second decryption time. Waste of time? Point of diminishing returns? When we are dealing with less than 10 seconds, I really could care less.   Again, if I was running a web server that needed to decrypt messages on the fly (encrypting is much faster), then this would become a problem. For the rest of us, do not give it a second thought. This is one of the reasons banks use 2048, it saves them computer resources and protects them against DDoS attacks.   And these calculations based on how long it will take to crack a key rely on the fact that the keys themselves do not have any weaknesses.   Remember back in 2010, a group of researchers were able to decrypt a 1028 bit RSA openssl key using a method of voltage fluctuations.    While none of us are using OpenSSL for our PGP keys, vulnerabilities MAY EXIST and be discovered one day.   And remember how Snowden accused RSA of accepting $10 million for weakening it's random number generators   So again, while the key strength in a perfect world would last until the universe implodes, if certain flaws are ever discovered, the extra key length may be the only thing that saves you long enough to switch over your keys to a different algorithm while the NSA starts cracking your keys.   When we are dealing with less than a few seconds? I will opt for 4096 bits.","Since 1977, RSA public-key encryption has protected privacy and verified authenticity when using computers, gadgets and web browsers around the globe, with only the most brutish of brute force efforts (and 1,500 years of processing time) felling its 768-bit variety earlier this year. Now, three eggheads (or Wolverines, as it were) at the University of Michigan claim they can break it simply by tweaking a device's power supply. By fluctuating the voltage to the CPU such that it generated a single hardware error per clock cycle, they found that they could cause the server to flip single bits of the private key at a time, allowing them to slowly piece together the password. With a small cluster of 81 Pentium 4 chips and 104 hours of processing time, they were able to successfully hack 1024-bit encryption in OpenSSL on a SPARC-based system, without damaging the computer, leaving a single trace or ending human life as we know it. That's why they're presenting a paper at the Design, Automation and Test conference this week in Europe, and that's why -- until RSA hopefully fixes the flaw -- you should keep a close eye on your server room's power supply. http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/09/1024-bit-rsa-encryption-cracked-by-carefully-starving-cpu-of-ele/;Intentional flaws created by the National Security Agency in RSA's encryption tokens were discovered in September, thanks to documents released by whistleblower Edward Snowden. It has now been revealed that RSA was paid $10 million by the NSA to implement those backdoors, according to a new report in Reuters. Two people familiar with RSA's BSafe software told Reuters that the company had received the money in exchange for making the NSA's cryptographic formula as the default for encrypted key generation in BSafe.

It has now been revealed that RSA was paid $10 million by the NSA to implement those backdoors, according to a new report in Reuters. Two people familiar with RSA's BSafe software told Reuters that the company had received the money in exchange for making the NSA's cryptographic formula as the default for encrypted key generation in BSafe. So again, while the key strength in a perfect world would last until the universe implodes, if certain flaws are ever discovered, the extra key length may be the only thing that saves you long enough to switch over your keys to a different algorithm while the NSA starts cracking your keys.

Let's say that you had developed a special purpose chip that could try a billion keys per second. This is far beyond anything that could really be developed today. Let's also say that you could afford to throw a billion such chips at the problem at the same time. It would still require over 10,000,000,000,000 years to try all of the possible 128-bit keys. That is something like a thousand times the age of the known universe! Good luck with that... Essentially, anyone using longer keylengths than ~RSA-4096-bit today and in the next few decades (more like half a century) simply doesn't understand the magnitude of the problem as quoted above and is completely paranoid and cannot grasp the sheer volume of the figures mentioned above. It's more likely the entire RSA implementation will be compromised by then, rendering even the longest keylengths as useless as shorter keylength cipher strengths (that is *if* RSA is compromised -- this may not happen).Also, using keylengths above 4096-bit will cause many (almost all) PGP softwares to *choke* (on default settings) and you will not be able to encrypt/decrypt messages to your trading partners because of your ridiculously overkill keylength... Would you rather have your tin-foil hats on and not be able to use PGP with hardly anyone else besides a few very, very paranoid users who also use these overkill keylengths or use PGP to be able to encrypt/decrypt messages to *everyone* you would like to communicate with? Sure, in years to come more software and users may see the need to migrate to keylengths of RSA-8192-bit + but, we are nowhere near that stage yet and doing it this early will just introduce several compatibility issues -- you will see!What's the point of having such long keylengths that only you (and a couple of other, super paranoid people) can encrypt/decrypt and anyone you want to communicate with cannot read or write you messages again?"

There are twenty-five of these, meaning RSA-10 is equivalent to about a 5-bit symmetric cipher. Breaking an RSA-20 key requires you to try each prime number between two and one thousand: there are 168 of them, meaning RSA-20 is equivalent to about an 8-bit cipher. Doubling the keylength (from RSA-10 to RSA-20) didn't give us the benefit that we naively expected. Each additional bit gives correspondingly less in the way of additional security, and we quickly reach a point of diminishing returns.That point of diminishing returns happens around RSA-2048.

The primary thing that makes me unhappy.. is the plausibility of the argument offered by the gnu manual.  It says:  Quote:  Almost always when people use 4096-bit RSA theyâre doing so because they believe RSA-4096 to be much stronger than it is. The United Statesâ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) states that RSA-2048 gives roughly 112 bits of security and RSA-3072 gives roughly 128. There is no formal recommendation on where RSA-4096 lies, but the general consensus is that it would come in somewhere around 140 bits â 28 bits of improvement over RSA-2048. This is an improvement so marginal that itâs really not worth mentioning.  The last sentence isn't plausible. Given a number of 112 .. how is 140 a marginal improvement. It's a significant improvement.   It's 25% extra bits.  How is 25% ""marginal"" ?  Either that represents 25% extra search space  .. or..  It represents 2 ^ 28 extra permutations.   Diminishing Returns Quote:  That point of diminishing returns happens around RSA-2048. Once you move past RSA-2048, youâre really not gaining very much.  This 'diminishing returns' argument is used to almost imply there are  no practical benefits to using keys beyond 2048 bits.  But that's simply not true. Here's a numerical example.  Let's look at the diminishing marginal returns (or profits) from making tea-cakes  Profit per tea cakes Quantity:       Profit per Tea Cake      total profit for tea cake production     1 -  99         10 cents                            $100 100 - 199        15 cents                            $250  200 - 299        17 cents                            $402  300 - 399        16 cents                            $553 400 - 499        15 cents                            $703 500 - 599        12 cents                            $805  The point of diminishing marginal returns (in the tea cake example) is 300-399 since the profit from each tea cake drops from it's peak of  17 cents, to 16 cents.  That's the point where margin returns begin to diminish.    However, that's a red herring, producers would continue making tea cakes way  beyond this point .. because they want  to maximise their profit.  Similarly, we as users of encryption software are interested in maximising our  total security.  We want to be as safe as possible.  We want to use key sizes that the LEO can not break,  not now, nor in the future, even with best computers in the world.   Big keys are perfectly usable! I managed to successfully import JuicyMango's 16384 sized key into my pubkey db  and encrypt a short message to JuicyMango.   The import speed was fine.  The encryption speed was fine. So using a very big key doesn't seem to have a performance penalty. Generating a big key might be lengthy, but (generally) we don't create keys often.  I feel as though someone is trying to discourage us from using 4096 bit keys, but they're doing it without any solid justification..  in fact the justification is flimsy.  If anybody feels able to demonstrate that there really is no advantage to using 4096 bit keys over 2048 bit keys..    Then please go ahead. I will be very attentive to your explanation :-)  have a nice day.. and be happy  playground :-)   ",""

It's for those reasons you mentioned I also use 4096-bit keys at this time. But any longer keylength has to be considered overkill for the foreseeable future. Maybe in 50 years time I will need extra cipher strength, but by then no one will likely be using RSA/PGP anymore (in it's current variant(s) anyway) but some new algorithm that probably doesn't even exist yet.","When we are dealing with less than a few seconds?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","m0rph","33243","2014-03-23T08:50:43","My new 16384 bit PGP key","Discussion/Security"," It is significant imo. 112 bits is considered the minimum necessary for security into the foreseeable future, provided that quantum computers don't make significant advances anyway. That means it is thought currently that a 2,048 bit RSA key is enough to keep you safe for the foreseeable future (always assume I am talking about a pre-quantum future). But it is literally right on the dot of the suggested minimum for this. I see no reason not to use 4,096 bit keys though. It's really not a big hassle compared to 2,048 bit. And also if we look at the past, 80 bits was for a long time the suggested right on the dot minimum for symmetric security, but today it is no longer considered enough to keep you safe for the foreseeable future, it's just thought enough to keep you safe right now. I prefer to have a bit of a margin rather than meeting the absolute minimum requirement for security into the foreseeable future, because as the future keeps coming at us, we can see further and further into the future. There is also the fact that the bigger your RSA key is the more protected it is from quantum computers, in that more stabilized quantum bits are required to crack it. Some people think that this wont buy you much time because quantum computers will increase in power so rapidly that it will be a small leap from 2,048 bit RSA cracking to 4,096 bit RSA cracking, but maybe they will run into some hard limit that will be able to crack 2,048 but not 4,096.   So in general yeah you are probably just fine with a 2,048 bit RSA key. Nobody thinks it is crackable now or any time very soon. But it's so trivial to use 4,096 bit that you might as well, and it does give a significant extra margin of protection. 28 bits more symmetric security is nothing to scoff at, it's actually exponentially more secure (the difference between trying 2^112 and 2^140 primes, to be close to precise). But primarily you should be more concerned about indirect attacks than you should be concerned about cryptanalysis. It's a much more realistic threat that you will be hacked, key logged, etc, than it is that your 2,048 bit RSA will cracked. But when it is so easy to use 4,096 bit keys why not?!      Arriving at a full understanding of it will require fairly advanced education in mathematics. I don't have anywhere near a full understanding of it, but I have used it in programs I have written and done various semi-advanced things with it.    This is a misunderstanding of what the password accomplishes. Your private key is stored symmetrically encrypted on your drive to protect from an attacker stealing it if they gain access to your system. It has absolutely no effect on the strength of the asymmetric encryption. You could use no password at all and it would be just as secure up to the point someone pwns your system or grabs your laptop etc. Increasing the bit strength of the asymmetric algorithm makes it harder for someone to derive your private key from your public key, using a long password makes it harder for someone to decrypt your private key if they gain access to the ciphertext form it is stored in on your machine.    It's actually far more than a 25% increase to the security. It's the difference between 2^112 and 2^140. It's an exponentially huge improvement.   Each additional bit doubles the previous search space.","Despite the reservations of the gnu manual, i will stick with my 4096 bit key....28 extra bits sounds significant to me.;Your quote from the manual has made me want to know more aboutelliptical curve cryptography ... i know it's used in key generation for bitcoin.But that's all i know... i'd like to arrive at a full understanding of it.;Quote from: weatherman on March 23, 2014, 04:20:42 am...

Let's say that you had developed a special purpose chip that could try a billion keys per second. This is far beyond anything that could really be developed today.

I don't know the exact implementation they are using, never heard of s2k, but it sounds like it is related to PBKDF2 perhaps. It's a KDF in any case. With simple hash iteration KDF's that don't attempt to drain memory so they can't be run in parallel as easily, you can use this formula to compute the additional security it buys you.   (log2( iterations * 2^password_entropy_bits ) - password_entropy_bits ) / entropy_of_character_in_set  so assuming say 40 bits of entropy in password and 100,000 iterations (which is a lot), we have about 16.6 bits of additional time-entropy (for lack of a better word) added. Assuming ASCII character set, I think 6.5 bits per character roughly, so it's the same as adding ~2.5 randomly selected ASCII characters to your password to set the iteration count at 100,000 in this case. It takes your total password strength from being 40 bits to being about 56.6 bits.   This formula works because before since your password search space was 2^40, an attacker would have to guess  1,099,511,628,000 times to exhaust the search space. So if there is one hash per password guess, they need to hash that many times. But now for each time they guess, instead of hashing a password once, they need to hash it out 100,000 times. So now the search space is 1,099,511,628,000 * 100,000 = 109,951,162,800,000,000. And log2( 109,951,162,800,000,000 ) = ~56.6 , so it made the search space equivalent to what it would have been if the password was 56.6 bits to begin with, with no iterations. So 56.6 - 40 = 16.6 , and it is like about 16.6 bits of entropy were added, though it's really just the time that is affected. Since a random ASCII character has about 6.5 bits of entropy in it, we can see that using 100,000 iterations gave use the added security of adding ~2.5 randomly selected ASCII characters to the password. Now this is helpful for sure, and for some passwords it brings them from the realm of crackable to not possible to crack. But KDF like this generally meet the following goals:  1. They have very little effect on horrible passwords. Turning a 2 character password into what is essentially a 4 character key space isn't going to save the day. 2. They make passwords that are just barely crackable just barely not yet crackable. A password that is just barely in the red zone (crackable, but almost not so) can be put just barely into the yellow zone (not yet crackable, but in a precarious position) 3. They make passwords that are just barely in the yellow zone (not crackable any time soon, but maybe in the foreseeable future years down the road) just barely in the green zone (not crackable in the foreseeable future) 4.  They give really good passwords an extra margin of security. But a really good password that is as far into the green zone as it should be is not going to need it anyway. But it's still nice to have, especially since it is almost free.  There are some newer designs like scrypt that try to make it hard to parallelize the cracking too, these are most likely significantly better than the older ""iterations only"" KDF techniques but the current consensus opinion is that they are too new and have not been researched enough yet to make definitive claims about. They could (almost certainly will imo) turn out to be like pure iteration based KDF's on steroids though, as they use memory requirements to make it much harder to run traditional powerful password crackers (like GPU clusters or ASICS) against them. But in any case, you really don't want to rely on the KDF, although it never hurts to increase it to as high as you can bare, keep in mind that these things are not really targeted particularly to really bad passwords (which will be crackable anyway) or really good passwords (which will not be crackable anyway), and their niche is the border line cases, they give just enough extra protection to make what was barely crackable barely uncrackable, or to make what was crackable in the foreseeable future just barely out of sight of being crackable.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","nickt22","25305","2014-03-12T19:01:38","How police search a house","Discussion/Legal","To search your residence, a warrant signed by a magistrate judge is needed unless there is overwhelming evidence that a crime is CURRENTLY taking place...such as screaming, strong chemical smells etc. I would say 80%+ of residence searches require a very specific warrant and evidence. Don't feel like typing it all again cause I posted it somewhere else, but I had an experience where I was arrested during a search warrant raid searching specifically for guns, but all they found was a bunch of drugs. I went to jail but was never charged because the items they found were not listed as suspected contraband to be search for..so all the evidence had to be suppressed. That's what I mean by specific, they have to know what they are looking for. And honestly, they will look fucking everywhere within a reasonably defined scope if they have a search warrant. Now if cops come to your residence without a warrant/probable cause and ASK to search, don't cause a scene just deny the search and answer whatever questions they have. If you consent to a search upon an officers without a warrant you are leaving yourself completely vulnerable to incrimination if they find something that catches their interest.","What procedures/things do police look for when searching a house?  What are common hiding spots that they'll look for?  If anyone has any insight or any LE printed documents on the subject this is the forum to share them in."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","DoctorMischief","25305","2014-04-14T03:49:33","How police search a house","Discussion/Legal","I have had my house searched multiple times.  First time, they missed a taser (illegal in UK) which was sitting on my kitchen counter, but they took all my Holland and Barrett supplements ""for testing""  They took my unused needles (for roids) but left several bags of unused, sealed steroid powder.  They took 1 tiny peice of contraband which was in a drawer somewhere but missed two boxes of .357 and .308 sniper rifle rounds on my book shelf.  Couldn't figure out what the fuck thye were doing, literally the really bad stuff was SOOOOOO obvious it was unreal.  The next time they searched top to bottom, except didn't look in my extractor fan above the oven where everything was stashed, so I sat in the living room and even went in to the kitchen and made myself a sandwich while they tore the house apart but didn't even think to look in the extractor.  So basically it just depends, they can be completely incompetent or you can get a good search team.  Last time I got arrested i claimed I was homeless, so they didn't get a section 18 warrant to search my house (I'm a suspected gangster/career criminal so even a drunk and disorderly arrest will result in them searching my house for weapons/drugs etc) it was pretty funny when they bailed me ""to no fixed abode"" and then handed me my rolex and a wallet with a bunch of crisp 50 pound notes in.  I don't register to vote, and I only ever get ridiculous addresses put on my driving licence - for example I have a friend who teaches at a boarding school way up in Scotland, so when I was arrested in London they called some tiny police force in North Scotland and gave them my address, and they were like ""wtf we're not searching a boarding school"" haha  My real address was within walking distance of the police station.

Anonymous Serbia two months ago began "" training ""people concerned about anonymity on the Internet, and today more than 50,000 people simply"" disappeared ""from the Internet, and some of them off the radar of the security services.  Because the BIA and VBA did not want to answer our questions, we talked with the nickname HC on the social network ""Facebook"" in order to learn more about the seminar.  AFN to request only publishes initial order.  AFN: How did the idea to open the ""Academy of anonymity""?  HC: In Serbia, the security service bugged and / or follow you around half a million people. That's a serious number of people in such a small country. Citizens' lives should be private, and the state should be fully transparent. Since we are the internet and the idea that the name means, we decided to help all stakeholders to become anonymous on the internet.  AFN: How many people were at the Academy?  HC has already notched up more than 100,000, and according to our evaluation, some 50,000 has actually become anonymous.  AFN: What was more, men or women?  HC I really do not know. It is important to us. Who understands the seriousness of the problem in which we find ourselves, realize that no matter who becomes anonymous.  AFN: What do you teach people to the Academy?  HC: All the techniques which are able to teach them. Few of us, so that we can all achieve. I wish I were a lot more, so that we can all learn everything, but now we can not.  AFN: Do you somehow intend to continue this your project?  HC now we agree on how to strengthen the Academy's students to teach others about the importance of anonymity on the Internet.  AFN: Once they say ""the importance of anonymity on the Internet"", can you explain why it is important?  HC I would not know where to start ... For example, it happened that people publish to go to sea to their name, and then the burglars knew the house was empty and that to them. It also happened that people go into a media lynching of certain persons who are on the Internet under his real identity. Hill's cases involving harassment, so called. cyber bulling, resulting in suicide bullied. It is important to note, also, that personal data is usually in the hands of private companies are required to provide at the request of the data: but the data usually include: who is doing what and where, with whom to socialize, whether it is to anyone in connection with whom to communicate and what most. This information should not have a state. Do not talk about that you do not need to have a private company ...  AFN So from all your danger?  HC: So something.  AFN: What do you think about the impact of the Academy?  HC: I believe that every phone is ringing in the security services. With their radar is missing more than 50,000 people. This is serious. This means you will understand our message ...  AFN: And your message is?  HC do not want to watch our every move.  AFN: AFN like to thank you for at least were responding to our questions.  HC: You are welcome. We are very proud of our Academy, and we have no reason to hide. And I really do not know why the security hide what they are doing ... Maybe they are ashamed of their actions.

Speaking to Torrent Freak, the site's anonymous operators detailed how they use a series of virtual machines to fool companies into hosting the torrent site.   The Pirate Bay doesn't own any physical servers. Rather, the site is spread across different commercial cloud hosting providers.  Twenty-one ""virtual machines"" are scattered around the world and are used to handle different functions of the site. A virtual machine is a simulated operating system running on another computer, and The Pirate Bay uses them to break the site's functions down onto different hosting platforms. According to the site, this is how the cloud hosting is split up among its virtual machines:      8 web     6 search     2 database     1 LVS (a Linux virtual server as a load balancer)     1 stats      1 for proxy site on .80 (another way to access The Pirate Bay)     1 torrents     1 control  A load balancer handles incoming traffic, which distributes that traffic to the virtual machines and masks what they are actually doing. This way, investigators can't actually ""see"" where Pirate Bay's website actually is, and Pirate Bay can host its site on commercial cloud hosting servers without worrying about discovery.  The sophisticated hosting setup means that if anything happens to one of the site's hosting providers, the virtual machine can be quickly moved to another hosting company. But the main advantage of using cloud hosting is that The Pirate Bay is now virtually raid-proof. There are no physical servers to seize, and the underlying servers powering the virtual servers don't know they're hosting Pirate Bay â so it's difficult for police to actually take the site down.   In 2006, Swedish police raided the hosting company owned by The Pirate Bay and seized everything from servers to fax machines and blank CDs. While this was a significant blow to the site, it returned just three days later.",""

By Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani,   The National Security Agency is gathering nearly 5 billion records a day on the whereabouts of cellphones around the world, according to top-secret documents and interviews with U.S. intelligence officials,  enabling the agency to track the movements of individuals â and map their relationships â in ways that would have been previously unimaginable.  The records feed a vast database that stores information about the locations of at least hundreds of millions of devices, according to the officials and the documents, which were provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. New projects created to analyze that data have provided the intelligence community with what amounts to a mass surveillance tool.  The NSA does not target Americansâ location data by design, but the agency acquires a substantial amount of information on the whereabouts of domestic cellphones âincidentally,â a legal term that connotes a foreseeable but not deliberate result.  One senior collection manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity but with permission from the NSA, said âwe are getting vast volumesâ of location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. Additionally, data are often collected from the tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones every year.  In scale, scope and potential impact on privacy, the efforts to collect and analyze location data may be unsurpassed among the NSA surveillance programs that have been disclosed since June. Analysts can find cellphones anywhere in the world, retrace their movements and expose hidden relationships among the people using them.  U.S. officials said the programs that collect and analyze location data are lawful and intended strictly to develop intelligence about foreign targets.  Robert Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, said âthere is no element of the intelligence community that under any authority is intentionally collecting bulk cellphone location information about cellphones in the United States.â  The NSA has no reason to suspect that the movements of the overwhelming majority of cellphone users would be relevant to national security. Rather, it collects locations in bulk because its most powerful analytic tools â known collectively as CO-TRAVELER â allow it to look for unknown associates of known intelligence targets by tracking people whose movements intersect.  Still, location data, especially when aggregated over time, are widely regarded among privacy advocates as uniquely sensitive. Sophisticated mathematical techÂ­niques enable NSA analysts to map cellphone ownersâ relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths. Cellphones broadcast their locations even when they are not being used to place a call or send a text message.  Page 2 of 3 NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show  CO-TRAVELER and related tools require the methodical collection and storage of location data on what amounts to a planetary scale. The government is tracking people from afar into confidential business meetings or personal visits to medical facilities, hotel rooms, private homes and other traditionally protected spaces.  âOne of the key components of location data, and why itâs so sensitive, is that the laws of physics donât let you keep it private,â said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. People who value their privacy can encrypt their e-mails and disguise their online identities, but âthe only way to hide your location is to disconnect from our modern communication system and live in a cave.â  The NSA cannot know in advance which tiny fraction of 1 percent of the records it may need, so it collects and keeps as many as it can â 27 terabytes, by one account, or more than double the text content of the Library of Congressâs print collection.  The location programs have brought in such volumes of information, according to a May 2012 internal NSA briefing, that they are âoutpacing our ability to ingest, process and storeâ data. In the ensuing year and a half, the NSA has been transitioning to a processing system that provided it with greater capacity.  The possibility that the intelligence community has been collecting location data, particularly of Americans, has long concerned privacy advocates and some lawmakers. Three Democratic senators â Ron Wyden (Ore.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (Md.) â have introduced an amendment to the 2014 defense spending bill that would require U.S. intelligence agencies to say whether they have ever collected or made plans to collect location data for âa large number of United States persons with no known connection to suspicious activity.â  NSA Director Keith B. Alexander disclosed in Senate testimony in October that the NSA had run a pilot project in 2010 and 2011 to collect âsamplesâ of U.S. cellphone location data. The data collected were never available for intelligence analysis purposes, and the project was discontinued because it had no âoperational value,â he said.  Alexander allowed that a broader collection of such data âmay be something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not right now.â  The number of Americans whose locations are tracked as part of the NSAâs collection of data overseas is impossible to determine from the Snowden documents alone, and senior intelligence officials declined to offer an estimate.  âItâs awkward for us to try to provide any specific numbers,â one intelligence official said in a telephone interview. An NSA spokeswoman who took part in the call cut in to say the agency has no way to calculate such a figure.  An intelligence lawyer, speaking with his agencyâs permission, said location data are obtained by methods âtuned to be looking outside the United States,â a formulation he repeated three times. When U.S. cellphone data are collected, he said, the data are not covered by the Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable searches and seizures.    Page 3 of 3 NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show  According to top-secret briefing slides, the NSA pulls in location data around the world from 10 major âsigads,â or signals intelligence activity designators.  A sigad known as STORMBREW, for example, relies on two unnamed corporate partners described only as ARTIFICE and WOLFPOINT. According to an NSA site inventory, the companies administer the NSAâs âphysical systems,â or interception equipment, and âNSA asks nicely for tasking/updates.â  STORMBREW collects data from 27 telephone links known as OPC/DPC pairs, which refer to originating and destination points and which typically transfer traffic from one providerâs internal network to anotherâs. That data include cell tower identifiers, which can be used to locate a phoneâs location.  The agencyâs access to carriersâ networks appears to be vast.  âMany shared databases, such as those used for roaming, are available in their complete form to any carrier who requires access to any part of it,â said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. âThis âflatâ trust model means that a surprisingly large number of entities have access to data about customers that they never actually do business with, and an intelligence agency â hostile or friendly â can get âone-stop shoppingâ to an expansive range of subscriber data just by compromising a few carriers.â  Some documents in the Snowden archive suggest that acquisition of U.S. location data is routine enough to be cited as an example in training materials. In an October 2012 white paper on analytic techniques, for example, the NSAâs counterterrorism analysis unit describes the challenges of tracking customers who use two different mobile networks, saying it would be hard to correlate a user on the T-Mobile network with one on Verizon. Asked about that, a U.S. intelligence official said the example was poorly chosen and did not represent the programâs foreign focus. There is no evidence that either company cooperates with the NSA, and both declined to comment.  The NSAâs capabilities to track location are staggering, based on the Snowden documents, and indicate that the agency is able to render most efforts at communications security effectively futile.  Like encryption and anonymity tools online, which are used by dissidents, journalists and terrorists alike, security-minded behavior â using disposable cellphones and switching them on only long enough to make brief calls â marks a user for special scrutiny. CO-TRAVELER takes note, for example, when a new telephone connects to a cell tower soon after another nearby device is used for the last time.  Side-by-side security efforts â when nearby devices power off and on together over time â âassist in determining whether co-travelers are associated .â.â. through behaviorally relevant relationships,â according to the 24-page white paper, which was developed by the NSA in partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Australian Signals Directorate and private contractors.  A central feature of each of these tools is that they do not rely on knowing a particular target in advance, or even suspecting one. They operate on the full universe of data in the NSAâs FASCIA repository, which stores trillions of metadata records, of which a large but unknown fraction include locations.  The most basic analytic tools map the date, time, and location of cellphones to look for patterns or significant moments of overlap. Other tools compute speed and trajectory for large numbers of mobile devices, overlaying the electronic data on transportation maps to compute the likely travel time and determine which devices might have intersected.  To solve the problem of unÂ­detectable surveillance against CIA officers stationed overseas, one contractor designed an analytic model that would carefully record the case officerâs path and look for other mobile devices in steady proximity.  âResults have not been validated by operational analysts,â the report said.  Julie Tate contributed to this report. Soltani is an independent security researcher and consultant.  ",""

As for the idea that people are accessing services such as SilkRoad on a mobile device is very disheartening and makes me worried to the point that I am afraid they will end up in some kind of trouble because they did not take the time to do a little research and could of prevented anything from happening in the first place. That of course being the worst case scenario so there is a way for people that are familiar with the Android operating system and the micro technology that drives all of their favorite applications on their mobile device that you can use it in a safe manner and still keep conducting business as usual if it were but it is not recommended going down that path unless you know what you are doing as something small could easily cause a domino effects of mistakes leading to them being put in front of a judge or having their countries LE label them as a terrorist of sorts that they are a form of threat to their country or fellow man.  The next step would be to help support such projects such as the Tor Project and having VoiP applications such as Jitsi work with little to no problems running over the Tor network, or even helping others understand that mobile devices sold by Microsoft or Apple are just not worth the social points that come with it, donating to AOSP projects that help users use their device without the fear of being locked into a device that can and will collect information against them such as Replicant Project.   IF you must use a mobile device, do your research on how to use it safety and not leak any information, albeit you still have to use a form of service provider for an internet connection but with encryption it would slow them down to the point where they would need to break the encryption or take you hostage for your pass-phrase to collect all of your information.I can understand that in todays world it would be hard to not use a mobile device to keep in contact with everyone that needs to be.","Quote from: Agent on December 05, 2013, 06:01:32 pmThis new information is very hard to wrap ones head around, and raises so many questions like why does the NSA feel the need to collect all of this information and put all of these resources into trying to know everything about everyone ?The public knew that the NSA could help aid other agencies in tracking users by a mobile device but it was only a rumor that they already were and with this update seeing it has been happening for a long time without anyone even knowing is a scare, not just to those that cared about privacy before but to everyone that in the world that has trust in their government.It looks like that even using a system of burner phones is not only a waste of time but just as easy for them to locate someone so that would go out of the windows.

Some of the most pitiful posts I have seen on both the old and new Fora were made by people who were literally  desperate to get their hands on their next fix. One in particular stands out: a man in New York whose street-level heroin dealer had been busted. He was running out of H, and he plaintively wailed for help to learn what he needed to know so as to safely make an order so he wouldn't be ""dope sick for Christmas"" (This was about a week to ten days before Christmas, if memory serves.)   Others literally expect to be handed the sum of all knowledge while standing on one foot -- once again, they are literally desperate to get their fix.    Almost no one appears to be willing to put in the time and effort required to learn what they need to know to keep themselves safe. Instead, they want instant gratification. For all too many, all they can think of is getting their drugz -- they want their drugz, and they want them NOW!  FAQs are posted, tutorials are posted, even sticked -- but do people READ them? No, they can't be bothered -- they all wnat to be spoon-fed; they all want to have their hands held.   When I heard that Sheep and BMR were closing down, I just groaned, because I knew instinctively what it meant -- a literal tsunami of clueless newbies descending on here, the vast majority of them interested only in getting their next fix. <Sigh>   I would argue that mobile devices cannot be secured, regardless of what software you install on them. The only way to remain safe is not to carry one (and I don't.)   This I can agree with.    I couldn't disagree with you more. No one  needs a cellphone. No one  needs to be reachable 24h a day, 7 days a week. NO ONE.

Suppose you live in an apartment complex with 4-8 residents. The mailboxes for these units are accessible by any tenant - the mail delivery person has a key to the complex. Suppose a tenant in unit #1 opens the box for unit #4 and opens their parcel, finds the goods, and takes it, the mailbox owner having no knowledge of this happening.. until they catch them in the act.  Mail theft is a felony as we all know, but how practical is it to contact LE to report these thefts when the package(s) in question contain controlled substances? How would you handle this situation?   I told them that stealing mail is often instant jailtime, and unless LE actually have either a search warrant or substantial reason to suspect anything, they should just contact LE and let them know of the theft. For all they know, the parcels are gifts from relatives. Even if the theif tells LE what he took, I don't think LE would have any grounds to lay a charge on the owner of the mailbox without sufficient evidence of foreknowledge of the contents.  Of course option 2 is the old fashioned baseball bat but this opens the door to additional attention from LE if you starting breaking someone's face open.   Option 3 is to pick a different drop, or only order via courier /w signature.  What would you do? Has anyone had experiences of theft from your drop?",""

GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected.  If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected. Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

PGP for simpletons and now I think I can use it okay. I sent a few messages to a vendor I'm dealing with and am just waiting to see if he can decrypt them. _______________________________________________________  1) Create your key â In the Keychain Access window, creating/exporting/importing keys is super simple. I won't go into much detail here, because it's unnecessary. Besides, you will only need to create a key whenever you feel you need a new one, and otherwise this window is basically just a list of all the keys you've gathered from other people. Note: when you create a key, you need a passphrase for that key. If you forget this passphrase, you are fucked. No excuses, no recovery. Deal with it. 2) Setting up your GPG shortcuts â This is the part that hangs people up I think. I would recommend you go to your System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Services (left box) and then go to Text in the right box. Scroll down and check all the OpenPGP options. If you can handle this, the hard part is literally over. Read on. 3) Encrypting â Open TextEdit or your favorite text editor, and type your message. Literally just type whatever you want to say. Got everything? Cool. Highlight your message, right-click it, and go down on your pop-up menu toServices. When that pops open, you'll see the GPG options you enabled in Step 2! Click Encrypt Selection, select your key when prompted, deselect Add to Recipients and BOOM now your message is encrypted. 4) Decrypting â To decrypt a message from someone, you will first need their Public key. Find it, highlight it, and right-click your selection. Go down to Services again and select Import Key from Selection -- There you go. Key imported. Now to decrypt their message, just highlight it and right-click, go to Services, and click Decrypt Message from Selection. Choose the key you just imported. Now the message is in clear text. 5) How do you know your own public key? â Go to Keychain Access and select the key you made for yourself. Export it, and do not include your private key. That will spit out an .asc file which is just plain text, open it in TextEdit to see your public key.",""

Donât talk back or raise your voice.2.    You always have the right to remain silent. During police encounters, the best thing to do is not speak.3.    You have the right to refuse searches. You should make it very clear, âOfficer, I do not consent to searches."" The officer is not required to tell you that you have the right to refuse a search. Never consent to a search. You may refuse a search of your car, house and personal items. Also you are not required to empty your pockets. Do not consent to a search even if you know that you are not in possession of something illegal.4.    Donât get tricked. The police may lie to you. Donât let threats or promises trick you into waiving your rights.5.    If you ever feel as if the officer is detaining you, ask if you are free to go. Calmly state, âOfficer, are you detaining me or am I free to go?"" This will establish that the encounter is not voluntary, which can help you later in court. If the officer does not answer the question, then you are free to go. If the officer interrogates you, say, âI am going to remain silent. I would like to see a lawyer.""6.    Donât expose yourself to criminal activity in public.7.    Donât run from the police! This is enough evidence to support âprobable cause.""8.    Never touch a cop!9.    Pay close attention to detail and the order of events during a police encounter. Record the event either visually or audibly if you can. Immediately after, write down as much detail as possible â what were the officers statements, appearance, badge numbers, namesâ¦ Look around for possible witnesses. You will need this information later to report and possible police misconduct.10.  Do not let police into your home without a signed search warrant from a judge. The only times warrants are not necessary are in cases of âhot-pursuit"" and emergencies. If an officer comes to your door clearly say, âI cannot let you in without a warrant."""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Thirtyrox","1902","2013-11-03T03:15:31","Bitcoin DarkWallet coming soon!!","Discussion/Security","Can't wait for this to be released!! Sounds like something that both buyers, and vendors of SR won't be able to do without!   http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/31/darkwallet-aims-to-be-the-anarchists-bitcoin-app-of-choice/   ""[DarkWallet Aims To Be The Anarchist's Bitcoin App Of Choice  Bitcoin may be the worldâs first decentralized, stateless digital currency. But in the eyes of at least one group of anarchists, the Bitcoin community has been getting a little too cozy with the establishment. And they want to bring the cryptocurrency back to its anti-regulatory roots.  On Thursday a group of libertarian Bitcoin developers calling themselves Unsystem launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to code a new Bitcoin âwalletâ theyâre calling DarkWallet. Like any Bitcoin wallet, DarkWallet will store a userâs Bitcoins and interact with the Bitcoin network, allowing the owner to spend and receive the currency. But unlike other wallets, DarkWallet is designed specifically to preserve and even enhance the properties of Bitcoin that make it a potentially anonymous, tough-to-trace coin of the Internet underground.  âIf Bitcoin represents anything to us, itâs the ability to forbid the government,â says Cody Wilson, DarkWalletâs project manager. (If Wilsonâs name sounds familiar, heâs also the creator of the worldâs first fully 3D-printable gun, another project designed to show how technology can undermine government regulation.) âDarkWallet is your way of locking out the State, flipping the channel to one beyond observation.â  To publicize DarkWalletâs fundraising campaign on the site Indiegogo, Wilson created this rather dramatic YouTube video:  Bitcoin has already served as a powerful tool for the so-called âdark webââ the lawless, anonymity-enabled corners of the Internet alluded to in some parts of Wilsonâs video. Bitcoinâs most recent moment in the spotlight came with the shutdown of the Silk Road, the Bitcoin-based anonymous online marketplace for illegal drugs that generated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of sales in its 2.5 years online; The FBI seized another $28.5 million in stored bitcoins believed to belong to the siteâs now-arrested alleged owner 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht just last week.  Bitcoin enabled the Silk Road by acting as a trustworthy form of payment that didnât require any real names. Though all Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible within the Bitcoin network, theyâre only linked to pseudonyms, and users can anonymize the coins further by sending them through a Bitcoin laundry that mixes up usersâ bitcoins with those of other users to make them harder to trace; Silk Road automatically mixed the coins of all its users.  But DarkWallet would go further towards making Bitcoin a truly untraceable form of digital cash. The wallet creators plan to include a feature called âtrustless mixingâ according to Amir Taaki, one of Unsystemâs founders and a longtime Bitcoin developer. Rather than hand a userâs bitcoins off to a typical Bitcoin laundry service that must be trusted to send back another more anonymous bitcoin, trustless mixing bundles together a collection of Bitcoin transactions and simultaneously sends them to new Bitcoin addresses that are also controlled by the same users; Since no one watching the transactions can see whose coins went where, the technique erases any ownership-identifying traces on the coins, while also avoiding the problem of trusting a third-party service to sufficiently mix the coins and not to simply steal them.  The software, which is intended to be a browser plug-in for Chrome and Firefox, would automatically coordinate the process with other users over the anonymity service Tor or similar services to further hide usersâ identities. The process could even be reduced to an anonymizing âtoggle switchâ that would enable users to launder their coins on command, says Taaki. âYou buy the bitcoins in a normal exchange, switch this on, and it slowly anonymizes them for you in the background,â he says.  DarkWallet would also aim to solve another potential privacy problem with Bitcoin that arises from wallet software âannouncingâ transactions to the Bitcoin network from a tell-tale IP address. By broadcasting the messages from a proxy address or over the Tor network, Taaki says that DarkWallet could prevent anyone from tracking a user based on those transaction announcements.  Wilson and Taaki see DarkWallet in part as an answer to Bitcoinâs increasing adoption by users and developers with more mainstream, government-friendly views. In the video above and in their writeup of DarkWallet on Unsystemâs website, they directly attack the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit group that has sought to engage with governments and use lobbying tactics to compromise on potential regulation of Bitcoin. âMany prominent Bitcoin developers are actively in collusion with members of law enforcement and seeking approval from government legislators,â reads one portion of the DarkWallet text. âWe believe this is not in Bitcoin userâs self interest, and instead serves wealthy business interests that make up the self-titled Bitcoin Foundation.â  When I point out those criticism to Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin Foundation founder and its chief scientist, he says that heâs met with government agencies including the CIA, but only with the intention of explaining Bitcoin, not helping to regulate it. âWhat weâre trying to do is educate regulators on what Bitcoin is and isnât and influence how the existing regulations are applied to Bitcoin, so that we get the best possible outcome and regulations arenât heavy handed,â says Andresen. âWe want to see Bitcoin succeed. We just think that talking and being open about it is better than trying to work undercover in the shadows of some kind of âdark web.ââ  With or without the Bitcoin Foundationâs approval, attempts to regulate Bitcoin are coming. The anti-money-laundering agency the Financial Crime Enforcement Network announced in March that some Bitcoin organizations would have to register as Money Service Businesses and follow the same money laundering regulations as users of traditional currencies. In May, the Department of Justice indicted the operators of Liberty Reserve, a Bitcoin-like alternative currency scheme, accusing them of running a $6 billion money-laundering operation. And under pressure from regulators, the biggest Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox announced later that month that it would require identifying documents for all users trading bitcoins for dollars.  Those moves to tighten the controls around Bitcoin are exactly why a service like DarkWallet is needed, argues Unsystemâs Amir Taaki. He sees the softwareâs anonymity features as part of an âarms raceâ with regulators thatâs necessary to preserve Bitcoinâs original libertarian purpose.  âWe need to investigate new methods and put them into practice, respond to challenges and adapt,â he says. âYou need people researching tools to empower individuals, give them anonymity, get around censorship and surveillance. Just putting Bitcoin out there isnât enough.â]""",""

The entire point of using PGP was to protect the message traffic in the event of server compromise.  Even PGP-encrypted messages are subject to compromise should one of the communicating parties be apprehended, and their computer(s) seized.  Even if you were to have PGP-encrypted some messages to Ross/DPR, now that he is in custody, you have to presume that the Feds have access to his PGP keyring(s) including his private keyring.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","2163","2013-11-07T02:03:04","PGP for Mac ... any recommendations please?","Discussion/Security","GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected.  If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8) or Mavericks (10.9)  the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGSuite:  https://releases.gpgtools.org/GPG%20Suite%20-%202013.10.22.dmg  Once you have installed GPGSuite,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected. Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

The head of the Bureau of Narcotics Repression of the Federal Police in SÃ£o Paulo , Roberto Ivo Costa da Silva , says the increase was considerable. "" Today , this form of trafficking is indeed a problem . "" The import has become a headache for the police mainly because of the anonymity promised by the internet . Consumers interviewed by sÃ£o paulo , for example , refused to reveal which are the sites that make their purchases . Until last year , the best known was the Silk Road , off the air today . Kept in the ""deep web"" ( the deep internet , with not accessible by search sites content) , the page was accessed only through Tor , a browser that makes it virtually impossible to locate the computers that host Web sites or access through him . Moreover, online shopping typically occurs with bitcoins . The currency is not issued or controlled by an institution , such as the role of the Central Bank in relation to the real, nor allows the identification of who holds outstanding . Completed the purchase process , the drug is sent by mail. According to the Revenue and Federal Police , arrives hidden in clothing , CDs , food cans , statues , backpacks , books , guitar, pipe and toys .

When the site is well established the normal btc fluctuations will cancel each other out, and with the hedging fee and the general tendency for btc to rise, hedging is not likely to cost SR too much, and might even make a slight profit. But at the moment, if btc prices take a huge fall (as seems likely)  SR coulkd be left holding a very expensive baby, when they have to pay all hedged vendors $4xx for coins that are now only worth $100.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","40005a","3754","2013-11-20T02:50:54","Mega Newbie Guide (GnuPT,Tor,TrueCrypt, BTC Mixing and more)","Discussion/Security","I just want to say that this is not finished, I'm intending to finish it tomorrow.  If anyone sees something that needs fixing, let me know. The more we notice that needs fixing, the better it will get.   The Ultimate all in one so easy that if you cant do it, you don't qualify as a life-form, guide to everything the newbie needs to know from a to z   Getting the party started This is a guide for newbies, we will be talking about things such as Windows, TrueCrypt, GnuPt, LocalBitCoins, BitCoinFog and others. This is not a really in depth guide, this is what I consider a very basic setup that's easy for newbies to setup and use but provides some amount of protection. (no guarantees on how much)  So you're here, you're reading this so we shall assume you figured out how to install the Tor Browser Bundle and type in that .onion you've been itching to try. But that was only the first step, in what is a never ending journey. Keep in mind there is always something new to learn, everyday LEARN SOMETHING NEW.   MicroSD I suggest that you get a microSD card with a USB adaptor, these are small, easily destroyed and Jesus it's amazing that you can fit 128GB on that little thing. (Not that you need 128GB, 4GB is more than enough, but they are cheap so go as big as you can afford.) This is later going to be Encrypted.   A Word On Passwords ( THIS IS IMPORTANT) You need long, unique passwords. 30+ characters, with Upper-case, Lower-case, Symbols and Numerals.  After learning some new information, I want to update this section to include Diceware.   \\**ClearWeb**\\ http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html  \\**ClearWeb**\\ What Is Diceware? Dicewareâ¢ is a method for picking passphrases that uses dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List.  Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select one unique word from the list. Here is a short excerpt from the Diceware word list:  16655 clause 16656 claw 16661 clay 16662 clean 16663 clear 16664 cleat 16665 cleft 16666 clerk 21111 cliche 21112 click 21113 cliff 21114 climb 21115 clime 21116 cling  21121 clink 21122 clint 21123 clio 21124 clip 21125 clive 21126 cloak 21131 clock  The complete list contains 7776 short English words, abbreviations and easy-to-remember character strings. The average length of each word is  about 4.2 characters. The biggest words are six characters long. The list is based on a longer word list posted to the Internet news group  sci.crypt by Peter Kwangjun Suk. An alternative list, edited by Alan Beale, contains fewer Americanisms and obscure words. And there are  lists for several other languages. You can also download the Diceware word list in PDF format or in PostScript format. Using Diceware  To use the Diceware list you will need one or more dice. Dice come with many board games and are sold separately at toy, hobby, and magic stores.  Toys""R""Us sells a package of five dice for about a dollar. Braille dice are also avaliable. You can purchase five casino-grade dice online from  Casinocom.com for about $11, but they are overkill for this purpose. Do not use a computer program or electronic dice generator. Download the complete Diceware list or the alternative Beale list and save it on your computer. Print it out if you like. Then return  to this page with the ""Back"" button on your browser. Decide how many words you want in your passphrase. A five word passphrase provides a level of security much higher than the simple  passwords most people use. We recommend a minimum of six words for use with Hushmail, wireless security and file encryption programs. A seven word pass phrase is thought to make attacks on your passphrase infeasible through 2033. For more information, see the Diceware FAQ. Now roll the dice and write down the results on a slip of paper. Write the numbers in groups of five. Make as many of these five-digit groups as you want words in your passphrase. You can roll one die five times or roll five dice once, or any combination in between.  If you do roll several dice at a time, read the dice from left to right. Look up each five digit number in the Diceware list and find the word next to it. For example, 21124 means your next passphrase word  would be ""clip"" (see the excerpt from the list, above). When you are done, the words that you have found are your new passphrase. Memorize them and then either destroy the scrap of paper or  keep it in a really safe place. That's all there is to it!  Example Suppose you want a five word passphrase, as we recommend for most users. You will need 5 times 5 or 25 dice rolls. Let's say they come out as: 1, 6, 6, 6, 5, 1, 5, 6, 5, 3, 5, 6, 3, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6,  1, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, and 4  Write down the results on a scrap of paper in groups of five rolls: 1 6 6 6 5  1 5 6 5 3  5 6 3 2 2  3 5 6 1 6  6 5 2 2 4 You then look up each group of five rolls in the Diceware word list by finding the number in the list and writing down the word next to the number: 1 6 6 6 5 cleft 1 5 6 5 3 cam 5 6 3 2 2 synod 3 5 6 1 6 lacy 6 5 2 2 4 yr Your passphrase would then be: cleft cam synod lacy yr Some Tips For maximum security make sure you are alone and close the curtains. Write on a hard surface - not on a pad of paper.  After you memorize your passphrase, burn your notes, pulverize the ashes and flush them down the toilet. If you are using a passphrase for file encryption, we recommend you keep a copy written down in a safe place.  If you don't and you forget your passphrase, your files are lost forever. If you want to work from a printed copy of the word list, download the the Diceware word list in PDF format or PostScript format. These files are formatted with 4 columns and 54 lines per page. You will get a neat, 36 page printout in which the first two dice  throws are the same for each page. This makes look-ups especially easy. If you prefer a more compact printout, here is an 11-page  version from Patrick Feisthammel. Be careful not to mark the printed copy in any way while you are selecting words. You can also  find the word list as an Appendix to Internet Secrets. If you need to make up passphrases often, get a shoe box or a food storage box about the same size. Put five dice in the box,  shake them up vigorously -- at least ten hard shakes -- and then tip the box to let all the dice slide down to one edge.  Now open the box, read the dice from left to right, or front to back if a few line up, and then just look up the corresponding  word list entry directly. Repeat this process until you have enough words for your passphrase. We recommend that you use the passphrase exactly as generated. If you want a stronger passphrase, select an additional word using the diceware method.  Because some words on the diceware list are two characters or less, you can get a very short passphrase.  If your passphrase, including the spaces between the words, is less than 14 characters long, we recommend  that you start over and create a new passphrase. You should also start over if your pasphrase is a recognizable  English sentence or phrase. (Neither of these situations occur very often.)     Tor Always make sure Tor is up to date, if there is a flashing yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it, you need to update. Now we need to make sure that we are blocking scripts Below the address bar you will see an S it might be just an S or it might be an S with a red circle/cross on it. Hover your mouse over this, select options. Select the embeddings tab, check everything except No Place-holder for objects.... and collapse blocked objects. hit OK Now in the upper left of the screen you'll see where it says TorBrowser, click on it and go to Options>Options Select the content tab and make sure Enable Javascript is unchecked, click ok.    LATER After you have created your encrypted MicroSD card extract Tor to that, and delete the Tor Bundle you were using.   TrueCrypt TrueCrypt is HDD Encryption software,  USE IT.  \\**ClearWeb**\\ http://www.truecrypt.org/  \\**ClearWeb**\\ You're going to want to use full disk Encryption to Encrypt your entire HDD. So open TrueCrypt and click System > Encrypt System Partition/Drive then follow the instructions. You need to make a strong password for this, so take a look back up at ""A Word On Passwords""   MicroSD Alright so now we are going to encrypt the MicroSD card. So plug your MicroSD card into your computer. Now open TrueCrypt, Select Tools > Volume Creation Wizard > Check Encrypt a non-system partition/drive, click next. Now we have some options, which are..  Standard TrueCrypt Volume and Hidden TrueCrypt Volume  Either is fine really, I prefer to create a hidden volume and put pictures of fat, nasty, old ladies in it, just so if they ever make me give up the  password to the outer volume they get to look at it. The rest from here is pretty easy, just follow the Wizard, and USE STRONG PASSWORDS.  This Encrypted MicroSD is where we are going to keep all our files, Tor Bundle, Gnupt or GPG4USB. I also like to keep my OPSEC and other reading  material on the encrypted drive. I would suggest putting a portable notepad on this encrypted drive also, notepad2 or notepad++ whatever, just make sure they are portable apps.  To mount the MicroSD, just plug it into the PC, start TrueCrypt and click Auto-Mount Devices, it will prompt you for your pass.   BleachBit Install this onto your PC, now open it and make sure the following options are checked,  Under System: Clipboard, Free Disk Space, Logs, Memory Dump, MUICache, Prefetch, Recycle Bin, Temp files. Under Windows Explorer: Most Recently Used, Recent Docs List, Run, Search History, Thumbnails  Every time you use your encrypted MicroSD, after you take it out, run BleachBit.    GnuPT  \\**ClearWeb**\\ http://www.gnupt.de/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=71&Itemid=516&lang=de  \\**ClearWeb**\\ GnuPt is personally my favourite GPG/PGP application, although for you beginners it might seem daunting. Feel free to use something like GPG4USB, there are guides on these forms, use the search feature.  Download and run GnuPT-Portable and run it, set the install location as the root of your encrypted MicroSD Go Into the GnuPtt directory and run GnuPT-Portable.exe, the first time it runs it's going download some files, it only happens on the first run.  After GnuPT is installed you will have an icon in your Task Drawer, right click and select key manager. From here you can import keys from the clipboard, create new keys and view all the keys that you have in GnuPT.  To encrypt a message simply copy the text you want to encrypt to your clipboard, right click on the gnupt icon and goto clipboard, then encrypt. Select who you wish to encrypt the text to and it will encrypt the contents of the clipboard. Now simply past the encrypted text into whatever  you are using to send it. You use the same process to decrypt a message, except after it's decrypted paste the message into notepad++  or whatever text editor you're using to see the decrypted text.  To create a new key, open the key manager click the key with a + sign and follow the directions, remember to use a 4096 bit key. ",""

That way only if your site key matches would you ever login.  Add a big box saying ""ONLY ENTER YOUR PASSWORD IF THIS IS YOUR SITE KEY"" (and educate users that their site key should also show - and be accurate!) BEFORE entering their password to login to the site.  Implementing such easy features (or similar ones) would stop so many of these phishing attempts going on.  The individual's site key should also appear on their account balance page, and on their deposit/withdrawal page (and any other sensitive pages, just so the user can verify they are actually on SR).  And of course, always use different passwords on different sites, just a basic I thought I'd throw in there.  Anybody think of a simpler, yet effective method?

In an apparent effort to compete with bitcoin, the decentralized online currency that has taken the internet by storm, JPMorgan Chase, the largest American bank by assets, has patented its own online payment system.  According to a patent application filed August 5 with the US Patent and Trademark Office (UPTO), JPMorganâs patent would give online users the ability to shop without the hassle of filling in a payment form with each purchase.  With what has been dubbed its âInternet Pay Anyone Account,â users will be able to spend ""web cash"" that has a ""real-time digital exchange of value"".  Admitting that traditional credit cards will continue to dominate the internet âfor at least the next five years,â JPMorgan said the consumer cost of using credit cards for many low-cost purchases is becoming too expensive for many consumers. At the same time, use of the bitcoin has helped online merchants trim costs and attract new customers.  Since January, the value of a single bitcoin, introduced in 2009, has skyrocketed from $13 to more than $1,000.  JPMorgan acknowledged the disadvantages of using traditional credit cards inside of a market that demands speed, security and, most importantly, low cost.  âWhile credit and debit cards may continue to be a viable payment option for merchants selling relatively high ticket items over the internet, credit and debit cards are not economically viable for purchases of lower cost items,â the US banking giant admitted in its patent application. âFor lower-cost items, the relatively high transaction processing fees plus the discount result in the transaction processing fee consuming a relatively high proportion of the total revenue generated by the product sale.â  In an apparent nod to bitcoin, JPMorgan said the popularity of online shopping âis spawning a direct model in which manufacturers of products or services are able to deal directly with consumers.â  The patent application emphasized the rise of âintense price competitionâ among online manufacturers, who are facing âmuch tighter marginsâ to make a profit. The competition has forced merchants to find new ways of reducing payment processing costs for their customers.  JPMorgan pointed to intellectual products, such as âpublications, music, video, software, gamesâ that are more easily purchased over the Internet as opposed to âtraditional physical (paper or disc) media.â  Higher bandwidth, together with the introduction of new technology to upload the intellectual products, points to robust growth in this segment of the online market. The changing dynamics of online shopping demands a âpayment form that has a low cost.â  ""A new marketplace has emerged for low dollar, high volume, real-time payments with payment surety for both consumers and producers,"" the financial holding company writes in the application.  The system also allows for anonymity.  ""The credit pushes can be made completely anonymously, with the recipient of the credit having no way to determine from where the credit originated,"" the according to the bankâs application.  Another feature of JPMorganâs patented digital wallet is the security it provides to online shoppers, who will be able to store virtual money into accounts, which, like bitcoin, is secured through cryptography, thus guaranteeing no breaches of security in the transaction between consumer and manufacturer.  However, it was anonymity that led the FBI in October to shut down Silk Road, a website that specialized in illegal drugs. An FBI official told Forbes the agency confiscated 144,000 bitcoins, worth close to $28.5 million at current exchange rates.  The official declined to reveal how the bitcoin wallet was traced back to the owners of Silk Road. ",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Jeks","477","2013-10-13T01:18:10","Tails + Onion Pi = Tor through Tor?","Discussion/Security"," grugq / PORTALofPi  **clearnet**   https://github.com/grugq/PORTALofPi  http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/10/05/thru-a-portal-darkly/   ","Thru a PORTAL DarklyOct 5th, 2013The Design and Implementation of P.O.R.T.A.LThe Personal Onion Router To Assure Liberty is designed to protect the user by isolating their computer behind a router that forces all traffic over the Tor network.PORTAL Gooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaals!!!!!!The goal of the PORTAL project is to create a compartmented network segment that can only send data to the Tor network. To accomplish this the PORTAL device itself is physically isolated and locked down to prevent malicious tampering originating from the protected network. So if the userâs computer is compromised by malware, the malware is unable to modify the Tor software or configuration, nor can it directly access the Internet (completely preventing IP address leakage). Additionally, the PORTAL is configured to fail close â if the connection to Tor drops, the user loses their Internet access. Finally, the PORTAL is âidiot proofâ, simply turn it on and it works.The Implementation, the Pain, the HorrorThe initial requirement was to develop PORTAL for a small personal sized router, such as the TP-Link 703N, 3040, or M1U. All of these devices are small, portable and support the OpenWRT open source router firmware. Unfortunately, it turns out that âsmallâ and âportableâ is synonymous with âweakâ and âunderpoweredâ.Unfortunately, Tor is quite resource intensive for an embedded device. Tor uses 16MB of RAM and for complete functionality (requiring the GeoIP database) it occupies slightly over 1.2MB of squashfs space. The stock TP-LINK routers have only 4MB of flash and 16MB of RAM (later models have increased RAM). This caused a lot of problems when building early versions. A bare bones OpenWRT system stripped down to just support an Internet uplink USB device occupies 3.2MB of squashfs space. Using the power of math we see: 3.2 + 1.2 > 4.0. Fuck.Enter The Dragon, or Chinese Hackers to the RescueFortunately, the TP-LINK routers are not just small, they are also extremely hackable. They are very popular with hackers who have modified the hardware and expanded the capabilities of the stock device. I got in contact with a Chinese hacker who has upgraded the TP-LINK 703N to 16MB of flash and 64MB of RAM. Sweet. Using these modified routers development of the PORTAL became much much easier.PORTAL System ArchitectureThe PORTAL requires a minimum of two network interfaces: one for the Internet uplink, and one for the isolated network segment. In order to protect the PORTAL from tampering from malware (or malicious users), it also requires a third administration interface. This can be either a serial console, or physical connection. The reason not to use WiFi for the administration network is that that would expose the administration interface to anyone within WiFi range, including potentially the userâs compromised laptopâs WiFi card.Three Interfaces to Rule Them AllThe requirement to protect the PORTAL from a malicious user caused some problems since the device hardware has very limited interfaces. The TP-LINK 703N has only:* 1 x USB 2.0* 1 x 100MB ethernet* 1 x onboard wifiAll available interfaces are required to get us to the three networks we need:* Tor: isolated proxy interface    * Tor SOCKS proxy    * Tor Transparent TCP proxy    * Tor Transparent DNS proxy    * DHCP (optional)* Admin: configuration management interface    * ssh    * https (optional)    * DHCP (optional)* Internet: uplink connection interface    * No servicesOperational PORTALAfter the user has configured the Internet, and whatever other adjustments they wish to make, they shouldnât need to connect to the Admin interface again. This leaves us with a very hard target for any attacker who wishes to unmask us (modulo any issues with Tor itself).The PORTAL has been hardened to make it significantly more difficult for the user to make a mistake, or for an attacker to subvert the Tor protections. From the Tor network the only exposed ports are Torâs DNS proxy, TCP proxy, and SOCKS. Optionally, you can use DHCP on this network.If, somehow, the firewall doesnât work properly, youâre still safe because the PORTAL doesnât actually route packets. The only way you can reach the Internet (regardless of which interface youâre connected to) is via Tor. This stops stupid mistakes, such as connecting to the Admin interface and forgetting to swap to the Tor network. Donât worry, you canât do that, it wonât work, youâre welcome.Final hardening is left up to the user who will have to assign the Admin and Tor networks to physical interfaces. There are security trade offs either way.    Medium Security:        Tor = WiFi        Admin = Ethernet        pros: ease of use        cons: pre-Tor plaintext will be broadcast over the AEther (see: Hammond)    Maximum Security:        Tor = Ethernet        Admin = WiFi        pros: ultra secure        cons: if an attacker cracks your WPA2 PSK, theyâll have access to your management sshd. Of course, theyâll be so physically close to you at that point, leaking your IP is the least of your worries.        NOTE: remote the WiFi card from your computer to block access via malware compromiseJust Do ItThe PORTAL project has been migrated to the RaspberryPi, which has more power to support Tor. It requires more configuration, which is something Iâll work on, however the ease of acquisition of the RPi makes this the current platform of choice. So go install PORTAL of Pi and compartment all of your sensitive operational activities inside an isolated Tor network."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","border warrior","5229","2013-12-02T00:54:09","Anonymous speech email service scammed me","Discussion/Security"," Anonymous has been unresponsive to others - Safe-Mail (always use pgp) is an Israel firm - see recent Guardian article   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  The National Security Agency routinely shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about US citizens, a top-secret document provided to the Guardian by whistleblower Edward Snowden reveals.  Details of the intelligence-sharing agreement are laid out in a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart that shows the US government handed over intercepted communications likely to contain phone calls and emails of American citizens. The agreement places no legally binding limits on the use of the data by the Israelis.  The disclosure that the NSA agreed to provide raw intelligence data to a foreign country contrasts with assurances from the Obama administration that there are rigorous safeguards to protect the privacy of US citizens caught in the dragnet. The intelligence community calls this process ""minimization"", but the memorandum makes clear that the information shared with the Israelis would be in its pre-minimized state.  The deal was reached in principle in March 2009, according to the undated memorandum, which lays out the ground rules for the intelligence sharing.  The five-page memorandum, termed an agreement between the US and Israeli intelligence agencies ""pertaining to the protection of US persons"", repeatedly stresses the constitutional rights of Americans to privacy and the need for Israeli intelligence staff to respect these rights.  But this is undermined by the disclosure that Israel is allowed to receive ""raw Sigint"" â signal intelligence. The memorandum says: ""Raw Sigint includes, but is not limited to, unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.""  According to the agreement, the intelligence being shared would not be filtered in advance by NSA analysts to remove US communications. ""NSA routinely sends ISNU [the Israeli Sigint National Unit] minimized and unminimized raw collection"", it says.  Although the memorandum is explicit in saying the material had to be handled in accordance with US law, and that the Israelis agreed not to deliberately target Americans identified in the data, these rules are not backed up by legal obligations.  ""This agreement is not intended to create any legally enforceable rights and shall not be construed to be either an international agreement or a legally binding instrument according to international law,"" the document says.  In a statement to the Guardian, an NSA spokesperson did not deny that personal data about Americans was included in raw intelligence data shared with the Israelis. But the agency insisted that the shared intelligence complied with all rules governing privacy.  ""Any US person information that is acquired as a result of NSA's surveillance activities is handled under procedures that are designed to protect privacy rights,"" the spokesperson said.  The NSA declined to answer specific questions about the agreement, including whether permission had been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) court for handing over such material.  The memorandum of understanding, which the Guardian is publishing in full, allows Israel to retain ""any files containing the identities of US persons"" for up to a year. The agreement requests only that the Israelis should consult the NSA's special liaison adviser when such data is found.  Notably, a much stricter rule was set for US government communications found in the raw intelligence. The Israelis were required to ""destroy upon recognition"" any communication ""that is either to or from an official of the US government"". Such communications included those of ""officials of the executive branch (including the White House, cabinet departments, and independent agencies), the US House of Representatives and Senate (member and staff) and the US federal court system (including, but not limited to, the supreme court)"".  It is not clear whether any communications involving members of US Congress or the federal courts have been included in the raw data provided by the NSA, nor is it clear how or why the NSA would be in possession of such communications. In 2009, however, the New York Times reported on ""the agency's attempt to wiretap a member of Congress, without court approval, on an overseas trip"".  The NSA is required by law to target only non-US persons without an individual warrant, but it can collect the content and metadata of Americans' emails and calls without a warrant when such communication is with a foreign target. US persons are defined in surveillance legislation as US citizens, permanent residents and anyone located on US soil at the time of the interception, unless it has been positively established that they are not a citizen or permanent resident.  Moreover, with much of the world's internet traffic passing through US networks, large numbers of purely domestic communications also get scooped up incidentally by the agency's surveillance programs.  The document mentions only one check carried out by the NSA on the raw intelligence, saying the agency will ""regularly review a sample of files transferred to ISNU to validate the absence of US persons' identities"". It also requests that the Israelis limit access only to personnel with a ""strict need to know"".  Israeli intelligence is allowed ""to disseminate foreign intelligence information concerning US persons derived from raw Sigint by NSA"" on condition that it does so ""in a manner that does not identify the US person"". The agreement also allows Israel to release US person identities to ""outside parties, including all INSU customers"" with the NSA's written permission.  Although Israel is one of America's closest allies, it is not one of the inner core of countries involved in surveillance sharing with the US - Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. This group is collectively known as Five Eyes.  The relationship between the US and Israel has been strained at times, both diplomatically and in terms of intelligence. In the top-secret 2013 intelligence community budget request, details of which were disclosed by the Washington Post, Israel is identified alongside Iran and China as a target for US cyberattacks.  While NSA documents tout the mutually beneficial relationship of Sigint sharing, another report, marked top secret and dated September 2007, states that the relationship, while central to US strategy, has become overwhelmingly one-sided in favor of Israel.  ""Balancing the Sigint exchange equally between US and Israeli needs has been a constant challenge,"" states the report, titled 'History of the US â Israel Sigint Relationship, Post-1992'. ""In the last decade, it arguably tilted heavily in favor of Israeli security concerns. 9/11 came, and went, with NSA's only true Third Party [counter-terrorism] relationship being driven almost totally by the needs of the partner.""

But everyone seems to agree that if anything, the NSA can break 1024 RSA/DH keys. Assuming no ""breakthroughs"", the NSA can spend $1 billion on custom chips that can break such a key in a few hours. We know the NSA builds custom chips, they've got fairly public deals with IBM foundries to build chips.The problem with Tor is that it still uses these 1024 bit keys for much of its crypto, particularly because most people are still using older versions of the software. The older 2.3 versions of Tor uses keys the NSA can crack, but few have upgraded to the newer 2.4 version with better keys.;Of course, this is still just guessing about the NSA's capabilities. As it turns out, the newer Elliptical keys may turn out to be relatively easier to crack than people thought, meaning that the older software may in fact be more secure. But since 1024 bit RSA/DH has been the most popular SSL encryption for the past decade, I'd assume that it's that, rather than curves, that the NSA is best at cracking.Therefore, I'd suggest that the Tor community do a better job getting people to upgrade to 2.4. Old servers with crackable crypto, combined with the likelyhood the NSA runs hostile Tor nodes, means that it's of much greater importance.;Step two is to get more users using the NTor circuit-level handshake, which is new in Tor 0.2.4 and offers stronger security with lower processing overhead (and thus less pain to relays). Tor 0.2.4.17-rc comes with an added twist: we prioritize NTor create cells over the old TAP create cells that 0.2.3 clients send, which a) means relays will get the cheap computations out of the way first so they're more likely to succeed, and b) means that Tor 0.2.4 users will jump the queue ahead of the botnet requests."

But everyone seems to agree that if anything, the NSA can break 1024 RSA/DH keys. Assuming no ""breakthroughs"", the NSA can spend $1 billion on custom chips that can break such a key in a few hours. We know the NSA builds custom chips, they've got fairly public deals with IBM foundries to build chips.The problem with Tor is that it still uses these 1024 bit keys for much of its crypto, particularly because most people are still using older versions of the software. The older 2.3 versions of Tor uses keys the NSA can crack, but few have upgraded to the newer 2.4 version with better keys.QuoteOf course, this is still just guessing about the NSA's capabilities. As it turns out, the newer Elliptical keys may turn out to be relatively easier to crack than people thought, meaning that the older software may in fact be more secure. But since 1024 bit RSA/DH has been the most popular SSL encryption for the past decade, I'd assume that it's that, rather than curves, that the NSA is best at cracking.Therefore, I'd suggest that the Tor community do a better job getting people to upgrade to 2.4. Old servers with crackable crypto, combined with the likelyhood the NSA runs hostile Tor nodes, means that it's of much greater importance.Consider also, the botnet that's been attacking the TOR network is using 2.3.Relays have been instructed to upgrade to 2.4.  Traffic priority is given to 2.4 users.*CLEARNET* https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clientsQuoteStep two is to get more users using the NTor circuit-level handshake, which is new in Tor 0.2.4 and offers stronger security with lower processing overhead (and thus less pain to relays). Tor 0.2.4.17-rc comes with an added twist: we prioritize NTor create cells over the old TAP create cells that 0.2.3 clients send, which a) means relays will get the cheap computations out of the way first so they're more likely to succeed, and b) means that Tor 0.2.4 users will jump the queue ahead of the botnet requests."

Keep your systems separate !  People should not be using their main system/setup to access SilkRoad, browse the Tor network and conduct illegal activities.  Albeit I detest Windows and OS X for being used but for the day to day operations of a work or home environment some people just prefer to use or do not know of any other way to get a set up working without it.  So when you are due to update your TBB package the safest way is to use a separate machine/setup/vm that can be connected to Tor if you wish it is only a small file, you don't want to download something like a torrent through Tor.  Using your separate machine you download Tor, verify it wasn't tampered with, then put it on an encrypted USB or burn it to a disk and take it to your second machine/setup/vm and run it.  Say you would only do this for software like TBB, Electrum Bitcoin wallet, Pidgen, Thunderbird. You wouldn't try opening unknown web pages or PDF's on your secured setup as this can risk compromising your information. That is what your first setup is for that will be running through Tor.  A virtual machine setup like Whonix on top of Linux or QubesOS would make this a lot easier that you can control each setup a lot easier and with less hassle on the users behalf.",""

My main system is OSX, but I do have VMs for Win and a couple Linux distros. I don't have Tails set up at all yet, or PGP, though I know I need to and will before doing anything I would be concerned about. Just taking my time first to get my ducks in order and make sure I'm not shooting myself (or anyone else) in the foot with bad or inadequate implementation.   Thanks again for your help.","The most complex but safest I have found so far is to have a computer that is used normally for every day use but on a large USB a QubesOS should be installed and within that you can run multiple VM's for anything you need and set it up so that it would be several machines running at once, eg: Private Tor nodes that you route your connection through, disposable VM for downloading and verifying anything you download off the internet, another for holding your PGP keyring and storing sensitive information, another to run Tails or Whonix desktop to access the Tor or I2p network. You get the idea.But that being said for those that do not want to go with this route, The simplest solution is to have Tails on your USB, then set up your regular every day machine with a VM or sandbox to download and verify downloaded files from the internet and then move them to an encrypted storage medium to access from Tails if need be.For those that are using TBB within Windows like you 1derwoman you should have a separate Windows persistent USB that is encrypted or VM that you access the Tor network with and another VM or sandbox on your normal Windows installation to verify or view content you have downloaded from the internet.I have chosen to go with QubesOS running from a thirty-two gigabyte USB on a laptop with VT-d that had its hard drive removed as soon as the laptop was removed from the packaging. This way everything I do is contained on an encrypted USB and I can run everything I want from a single device that is set up similar to a Tails installation with a dead man switch on the laptops power cable and the battery is removed."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Agent","1463","2013-11-19T08:39:02","Keeping your Tor Browser Bundle Updated & Yourself Safe (Newbies READ)*UPDATED*","Discussion/Security"," The most complex but safest I have found so far is to have a computer that is used normally for every day use but on a large USB a QubesOS should be installed and within that you can run multiple VM's for anything you need and set it up so that it would be several machines running at once, eg: Private Tor nodes that you route your connection through, disposable VM for downloading and verifying anything you download off the internet, another for holding your PGP keyring and storing sensitive information, another to run Tails or Whonix desktop to access the Tor or I2p network. You get the idea.  But that being said for those that do not want to go with this route, The simplest solution is to have Tails on your USB, then set up your regular every day machine with a VM or sandbox to download and verify downloaded files from the internet and then move them to an encrypted storage medium to access from Tails if need be.  For those that are using TBB within Windows like you 1derwoman you should have a separate Windows persistent USB that is encrypted or VM that you access the Tor network with and another VM or sandbox on your normal Windows installation to verify or view content you have downloaded from the internet.  I have chosen to go with QubesOS running from a thirty-two gigabyte USB on a laptop with VT-d that had its hard drive removed as soon as the laptop was removed from the packaging. This way everything I do is contained on an encrypted USB and I can run everything I want from a single device that is set up similar to a Tails installation with a dead man switch on the laptops power cable and the battery is removed.","Count me in on not having an orange button either.Also, thanks to everyone participating for all the info in this thread.About the downloading/OS issues... If I have access to countless systems, what would the ideal setup be, and what would I do on each? ie, from what I've gathered I should have a 3-system setup like this:1. main / regular stuff2. tor browsing3. downloading and verifying filesIs that correct? Am I missing anything? Should any of the systems be disposable? Is there a preferred OS or build I should get for this purpose?"

It's our duty as team mates fighting this revolution together to watch out for one another & to make sure everyone's doing there best with security measures!! Otherwise like many others have said....

Yes, if LE seized your computer they would be able to find out that at one point you had the Tor Browser Bundle on your computer... but this doesn't mean much, plenty of people use TBB especially since this NSA shit in the states. If everything else is clean in your house, having TBB won't give them anything, and they'd need to have a warrant for the computer, and have it analysed to even get that far anyway... That being said, you should look into using TAILS, a linux live distro that you can put on CD or a usb and just boot it up whenever you want to go on SR or whatever. It erases its memory every time you shut down and doesn't leave a trace on the host computer, so if you are in shit just destroy the flash drive and you're good. Even then, a flash drive with TAILS on it is pretty much useless because there isn't a record of what you've done on it.  Read up on security in your free time as a hobby, but don't turn it into this big looming stressor that dominates your consciousness or else using a site like this becomes not even worth it. Relax a bit, but not too much.    ","Alright thanks for the info! I feel like a fucking retard sometimes, I thought it was just download Tor and that's it so I haven't updated even once before.. Now I did that though.. Im thinking of get rid of my computer and get a new one, is that necessary? If I will have a police raid and they take my computer, can they find the history somehow? Im a really cautious man but this electronic freaks me out and if they search my  place they wont find anything at all except this computer so I need to know that it is totally secure or I will get rid of the computer and buy a new one to set on a new location and simply go there every time I need to place a order.."

That way your persistent volume would definitely be preserved.  Reformatting the USB drive should not be a problem as well. I suggest booting from a Tails DVD, then plug in the USB drive. Go to ""Applications"" -> ""Accessories"" -> ""Disk Utility"" and use that to delete all partitions on the device in question and reformat to suit your needs. Even overwriting the old USB partitioning by just selecting the ""Tails installer"" -> ""Clone & Install"" should work.  Can't say much about LibertÃ©. It has been a while since I've heard someone mention using it. Should be a valid alternative, but it has been ages since I've looked into it so I cannot say for sure.. my main concern would be out of date applications. Has it received updates in the way Tails has? Last time I checked it seemed as though it wasn't being actively maintained.  ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","naughtybits","1463","2014-09-12T19:51:34","Keeping your Tor Browser Bundle Updated & Yourself Safe (Newbies READ)*UPDATED*","Discussion/Security"," Ok no problem. So if I'm not mistaken your actual problem is creating a Tails USB with a persistent volume and I'm not quite sure where you want to keep the persistant volume, since you mention having several USB sticks at your disposal. I'll be trying my best to be as clear and precise as possible.  So we start from scratch:  - Boot from Tails DVD -> insert USB -> Clone & Install via the Tails installer.  - Now you can boot from your new Tails USB into a new session, rather than from the DVD. - Depending on the size of your USB stick you will have a certain amount of memory available for your persistent volume. - Create a persistent volume by selecting ""Applications"" -> ""Tails"" -> ""Configure Persistant Volume"".  - Choose wisely what applications you want to make persistent. For your general need to store data you simple check the ""Persistent Folder"" thingy.  - Use a reasonably secure password.  - Confirm creation of persistent volume and wait until the process has finished.  - There will be a message indicating that your persistant volume will be available after reboot. - Reboot from USB and when presented with the ""Tails Greeter"" login menu you select use persistence.  - You will have to type in your password and will be able to select enabling write protection.   In case you want to update this configuration when a new Tails version is released and there's no auto update  you have the following options: - Download the new .iso, don't forget to verify the pgp signatures, then burn in to a DVD.  - Boot into a Tails live session using the above mentioned DVD. - Plug in your properly configured Tails USB that you wish to update. - Update using ""Clone & Upgrade"". - Now you can boot into Tails from your USB with persistence being preserved.  Burning a new DVD for every update can be a bit annoying. But you mentioned having another USB stick at your disposal, yet being unable to reformat it.  If all else fails, something along the lines of  ""# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=4096"" using the command line with properly reformatting afterwards will definitely make its whole storage capacity available again. Unless of course the hardware is broken. Be careful here! Using the dd command without knowing what it actually does can lead to disastrous consequences in terms of data loss. Theres useful info on **Clearnet** https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Securely_wipe_disk  **Clearnet**  Should you manage to successfully reformat your second USB device again, you can use this USB to update your regular Tails USB with the persistent volume being preserved without having to burn a new DVD every time. Just use the ""Upgrade from ISO"" option in this case. Note that this has to be done in a Tails live session (i.e. via booting from a previously burned DVD) and then plugging in the Tails USB you want to upgrade as well as the USB stick you put the new Tails ISO on.  I hope this solves your problem. Also, for your own safety,  consider reading the whole Tails manual completely. You will find plenty of useful info in there. The stickied threads on this forum and elsewhere provide valuable information. ","I may not have explained myself well.So this is how I go about doing this.I start out with a USB drive that I already installed the TAILS ISO on.  But since I installed it from the ISO, it doesn't have persistence.   It does work.  But I can't save data.Then I get a new unused USB drive.I use TAILS to ""Clone and Install"" Tails on the new unused drive.  When I do that, TAILS reduces the available size of my unused USB drive to 2.48GB, and says ""error you do not have enough room on this drive"" or whatever.    Then I check the drive, and it has gone from 16GB, to 2.48GB.   No amount of reformatting or anything will recover my missing space on the drive.But like I say, if I just install the ISO without cloning from TAILS, everything works fine, just I can't use persistence.  Why the hell does my USB drive lose 13.5 GB?"

Most of this sounds like chineese to me. I am not to computer savvy, but I need to make sure I step it up and start using the proper security. I have been thinking about opening a vendor account. So I really really need to get this down packed.   1.Is me using the same method of security as you really a easy to learnd and/or a practical idea for someone not so computer savvy?  2.Or should I take the tails route and keep researching your method until I fully understand what I am doing?  Please help me I really want to be set up and running once SR comes back from its break.  Thank you  Anyones and everyones opinion is greatly appreciated as well.   ","Quote from: 1derwoman on November 19, 2013, 02:01:37 amCount me in on not having an orange button either.Also, thanks to everyone participating for all the info in this thread.About the downloading/OS issues... If I have access to countless systems, what would the ideal setup be, and what would I do on each? ie, from what I've gathered I should have a 3-system setup like this:1. main / regular stuff2. tor browsing3. downloading and verifying filesIs that correct? Am I missing anything? Should any of the systems be disposable? Is there a preferred OS or build I should get for this purpose?The most complex but safest I have found so far is to have a computer that is used normally for every day use but on a large USB a QubesOS should be installed and within that you can run multiple VM's for anything you need and set it up so that it would be several machines running at once, eg: Private Tor nodes that you route your connection through, disposable VM for downloading and verifying anything you download off the internet, another for holding your PGP keyring and storing sensitive information, another to run Tails or Whonix desktop to access the Tor or I2p network. You get the idea.But that being said for those that do not want to go with this route, The simplest solution is to have Tails on your USB, then set up your regular every day machine with a VM or sandbox to download and verify downloaded files from the internet and then move them to an encrypted storage medium to access from Tails if need be.For those that are using TBB within Windows like you 1derwoman you should have a separate Windows persistent USB that is encrypted or VM that you access the Tor network with and another VM or sandbox on your normal Windows installation to verify or view content you have downloaded from the internet.I have chosen to go with QubesOS running from a thirty-two gigabyte USB on a laptop with VT-d that had its hard drive removed as soon as the laptop was removed from the packaging. This way everything I do is contained on an encrypted USB and I can run everything I want from a single device that is set up similar to a Tails installation with a dead man switch on the laptops power cable and the battery is removed."

Depends on how much of whatever you have you have; if you could be charged with intent to distribute; and whether we're talking felony or misdemeanor possession;  and whether your apartment is within a school zone.  If you're  not ordering, and I'm not sure why you would be here if you weren't, then you'd be facing state charges.  You're going to have to be slightly more transparent if you want better advice. Your  MMJ card is worthless to the Feds. And if they smell weed, they can do a warrantless search. It's that you say you live in an apartment that is troublesome.  I'm done doing legal research for free, but I can point you in the right direction. There were a couple of recent US Supreme Court cases that you might want to look at.  The 1st was about having drug dogs sit outside of apartment doors without warrants, which was rejected as unconstitutional.   The 2nd was one in which the police had a warrant for Mr. X, whom they thought they saw run into Mr Y's apartment. They burst into Mr. Y's apartment, with no warrant to search him, and found drugs in plain sight, and arrested him. His conviction was upheld.   See above. If the police are coming to your house to question you, and they can smell bud, they're probably coming in. Why? Because why are they there to question you to begin with?  I've never had the police just randomly knock on my door.  If medical is legal in your state, and they're state police, you're fine. If it's the Feds, you're fucked. Because again, why the fuck would the Feds come randomly knocking on your door.  If there is no stench coming from your apartment, and they do not have a warrant, you do not have to answer the door and do not have to show your card. But think about why you're asking    Say it's the Feds coming to question you as a suspect in an investigation, and say your apartment reeks and you have the potential to destroy evidence: they're breaking the fucking door down. Anything in plain sight will give them probable cause for a warrant, and your safe is worthless. Safes, in general, are worthless.  I'd suggest calling your state's legal aide for advice.","I really do not do anything wrong besides smoke some bud and have some extra goodies on the side.

Just apprise yourself of your state's statutes.

But you should read it for yourself.  It's  NOT the BUD that concerns me; it's the  other things that concern me. Possesion of almost any hard drug (including Rx medication that is not prescribed to  you) is felonious. There is no such thing of misdemeanor possession of anything other than marijuana.

If the police in your municipality/state are particularly nosy, and you live in a medical state,  you still do not have to let them inside your apartment. If they ask you if they may come in--and they will ask very nonchelantly and politely-- you do NOT have to let them in. Say, NO, you may not, and step outside.

And can you briefly answer the mechanics of the aspect further please?Or if other people have input dont hesitate.Thank you!Yeah, the safest way to do it is to take a picture of something and upload it to Tails and take a screen shot with Tails.Then save it and upload it. Basically when the picture is taken, there are tons of possible metadata that can be stored including thumbnails, so even if you edit the picture, the original picture can show up in the thumbnail. Things like GPS coordinates and so forth. When taking a screen shot of the picture, the only thing that is saved to the photo is the time it is created and possibly the size of the photo. No identifying information should be present, but go the extra mile and do it within Tails so just in case there are any new forms of meta data we are not yet aware of. Devices are always getting new features and there are more and more metadata tags coming out all the time. So, you are correct in that screen shotting is the best way to strip the tags. And save as PNG."

DO IT FIRST YOURSELF BEFORE YOU UPLOAD.  Use the screenshot method - it is the safest for now. Obviously do not forget to crop the image to remove the window frame. ","The site should pose no risk when configured correctly. When a photo is uploaded it either converts or compresses it, wiping the exif data as it creates the file to be used on the site. That's why you can't get such data from a twitter photo for example.The risk is that the original file you uploaded (with exif data) is still present somewhere on the hard disk of the server,  on a block marked for deletion that has not yet been overwritten. Future forensics may uncover the file. If the config is done right, this is not a risk. Viewers won't be able to get any exif data from the version of your photo on the site in any case. Screenshot is still the absolute safest route, which is always reccomended but for uploading photos here it's not too important."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Great God Pan","94","2013-10-20T01:03:55","PGP Signature Verification - need help","Discussion/Security","At this time The Great God Pan would like to pontificate on the subject of PGP signatures, specifically what a PGP signature is.  First, a conceptual word on public-key / private-key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography).  Each user has two keys, named as you'd expect: the public key, which we post in our profiles and are know openly and publicly; and the private key, which sits encrypted on your computer (for most PGP programs) and is a closely guarded secret for you and you alone.  Due to the nature of the maths, for your key pair, what one key encrypts, the other key decrypts.  This works both ways--> your public key can encrypt a message (this is how someone sends you an encrypted message), and your private key can also encrypt a message.  But wait!  What's this?  My private key can also encrypt a message?  That would mean that my public key, which everyone knows, would decrypt that message.  What good would that do?  Anyone could look on my profile, load my public key, and see what I'd encrypted with my private key.  However, if we remember that private keys are private and no one else knows them, we suddenly find ourselves with a very useful tool to provide authentication instead of privacy.    Since I am the only one that knows my private key, anything encrypted by my private key could only have come from me.  Anyone can pull  your public key and send you an encrypted message, but that doesn't tell you anything about who sent it.  Signing the message gives you proof of authorship.  We just went through a perfect living example of where PGP signatures are so useful.  The old Silk Road has been shut down.  We operate in an anonymous environment.  Now, as people migrate to a forum and create new forum names, how can we tell if we are really dealing with the same vendor from the old market place or an impostor who was quick to claim jump a name?  We can verify them by their PGP signature!  So, what exactly is a PGP signature?  Well, PGP could have simply output a fully encrypted message (done with the private key) like it does when we usually encrypt a message.  That would be cumbersome, especially for a message which is notionally public.  Instead, PGP will hash the message, which creates a 160 or 256 bit tag which is kind of like a checksum for the message.  Changing only a single character in the message will change the entire hash of the message.  It's practically impossible at this point to find two messages which have the same has value.  PGP will then encrypt the hash value with the private key, and leave the rest of the message in the clear.  If I tell my PGP program to verify a message signature, it will first calculate the has of your message.  Then it will use your public key to decrypt the encrypted hash value at the bottom of the message, and then it will compare the two hashes.  If the hashes match, the signature is verified!  Because of these steps, when we want to verify a signature, we have to copy the entire PGP signed message block, which includes the ""-----BEGIN..."" header, the clear text message, and the signature block on the bottom.  You can practice verifying signatures over in the vendor round table thread.  If you'd like to sign a message and see if people can verify your signature, come join us in the PGP club thread!  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=179.0",""

That was all good until i see it arrives in my country then later that next day i check and it says delivered but i never received any package. 3-4 weeks later and still no show.  At the time i had messaged the seller about my situation and he replied that i was a scamming fucker it was delivered and after i stated in the best way possible that it hadnt arrived and that the postcode on the tracking of where it was delivered to was on the other side of my town and not the postcode i provided.  He then suddenly changes his mind about me being a scammer and replies with i will send you 2oz of my top grade for you not receiving your order. ( Strange change in mood on his part after calling me a scamming fucker  ) so im happy that i will be getting half my order again he provides tracking.   So i check the tracking and it says :Item accepted at ******** then the in transit bar starts to fill but it does'nt state where the package has reached while the bar fills.

I've just burnt and run a live cd of another OS which uses wicd as its NM, and it connects fine and offers me all the signals coming into this house.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","497","2013-10-13T17:00:34","nym server and remailers","Discussion/Security"," Nym.alias.net no longer exists -- it was established as a proof of concept of sorts in 1995 by some professors at MIT, and was run by a variety of student admins for about 10 years, until it was finally shut down.    I agree with the poster who said they were uncomfortable about having their traffic posted to an anonymous message pool (i.e. alt.anonymous.messages). He is right in that these messages will be archived, likely in perpetuity. That has always been the primary argument against using an anonymous message pool. I would argue, however, that there is now a false dichotomy between email as 'private' and alt.anonymous.messages as 'public'.   If the Snowden disclosures and Bamford's revelations about the Bluffdale, Utah installation tell us anything, it is that pretty-much EVERYTHING is now captured and stored for future analysis and interpretation. I've seen figures that state that upwards of 70% of Internet traffic that transits the U.S. at some point is amenable to capture by the NSA. It is only prudent to assume that this 70% figure will rise in the years to come. So, in that sense there is a false dichotomy between using Usenet to post traffic versus using email .    What I'm trying to say is that if all traffic can be captured/archived, then alt.anonymous.messages is actually preferable as a destination, since it does not lead to an email server that can be used to compromise a user. When the authorities come calling, your email provider, regardless of who it is, WILL roll-over on you. Sadly, there are far, far, too few Ladar Levisons in this world.   Since Usenet is widely distributed, there is no real way for the authorities to determine precisely where you pick up your message traffic. If, in the unlikely event that the nymserver is ever raided, the authorities will obtain your PGP key and your reply-block. If your reply-block is encrypted, they will follow the chain to get the remailer operator to decrypt the block, hoping to find an email address.  Having an email address, gives them a lead that they can use. They can then attempt to get the email provider to roll-over on you. If all they get is a pointer to an anonymous message pool, then they've hit a dead-end, or a brick wall -- they can go no further.  They can try and retrieve your traffic out of alt.anonymous.messages, but without your private key and passphrase, they would have to break your PGP key to read your message traffic.  Furthermore, if you have been using best practices, and use end-to-end encryption, they would have to break the underlying keys as well.   Given the dual-RSA format in the current PGP standard, one might consider periodically destroying/replacing the private half of the encryption sub-key. This would mean that even you could not be forced to decrypt traffic encrypted with a no longer existing encryption sub-key.

But the whole concept of dumping the messages to alt.anonymous.messages Usenet postings is a good one.  Done right, it really is impossible to determine who is receiving the message, because everyone downloads all the alt.anonymous.messages every day.    There are a few downsides, even aside from the ""Does the message get there?"" factor.  The biggest one is that the ciphertext of every message you receive is sitting in alt.anonymous.messages forever (Usenet posts never die, and THOSE messages will be around forever).  So at some point, maybe in a year, maybe in twenty years, maybe in a few hundred years, math and CPU speed will overtake whatever crypto you're using, and those messages will be readable by the world.   Somebody gave a good talk at DEFCON a while back about his analysis of the messages that were posted to alt.anonymous.messages, it should be easily findable via a quick search.  Youtube has a video of it, it's worth a watch if you're interested.   If you remember pine's post from the old forum about PGP messages giving away sender+recipient key IDs, it's that concept taken to the n-th level.    I personally dislike the idea of my ciphertext sitting in public view for hundreds of years, but with enough people using them, remailers provide a level of security that you aboslutely can't find elsewhere.  And you can't have it both ways.. if you are anonymous because ""anybody could read that if they had the right key"", then everybody could read that if they had the right key.  It boils the security down to the pure math (crypto), and that's ultimately where you want to be.  You do need a significant amount of traffic on remailers for them to be effective.. if only two people are using them, then traffic analysis should get really simple.

The fly in the ointment is, as always, keeping the pads secret.  MI5 used to carry out black bag jobs on suspected KGB illegals, and copying their one-time-pads (OTPs).  Once they had possession of the copy of the OTP, decryption was child's play. I'm sure the Yanks did much the same thing.   Furthermore, you would have to ensure that none of the pads were EVER re-used. If they were ever re-used, then breaking the encrypted traffic is easy.  The NSA attempted, for some 60 years, to break some of the Soviet OTP-encrypted traffic -- they succeeded partially, due to the Soviets accidentally re-issuing some of the pads, during the war.

I do have something to add though; nothing is quite so suspicious as actually using TOR itself in the first place.

For this you have two options 1. only use public WIFI to access TOR 2. spend a load of time ranting about the NSA and Snowden leaks, then they'll take you for a security/privacy nut. I'll bet there are shit-loads of those about now.  Incidentally, this isn't just speculation; I was reading an article on one of the few SR dealers that has been arrested, and TOR use was the reason LE stated was why they looked closer at them (originally it was a relatively minor complaint) and searched the business premesis.

Thanks again for your time, M&M","1) We've never had an order not arrive, either as a buyer or as a seller.2) Probably what matters more is choosing a vendor with good stealth. If stealth is tight, the amount being shipped is of secondary importance.3) Domestic mail in the U.S. receives very little scrutiny. Chances of a CD for a bit of cannabis are pretty slim, but this should not be seen as an excuse to be careless.4) Prominent vendors, at least in theory, are prominent because they offer good service such as quick shipping and competent stealth. But do your research by reading vendor feedback (all of it, not just the first page or two) and searching vendor names on the forums. Also check the forums of other markets, and also check The Hub.5) It is generally thought that the best method is to have deliveries to your home, but of course everyone's situation is different. If your home is not viable, maybe the home of a buddy could be used as a drop.6) I checked into a box at the UPS store, and it was pretty pricey. It also requires a lot of ID verification. People recommend using a box at a locally-owned establishment if there is one in your town.7) A cannabis delivery, no matter where it's being sent, should absolutely, positively not reek! If your delivery smells even vaguely of cannabis before you open it, blast that vendor with negative feedback and find someone else to order from.Good luck and stay safe."

Ask what your options are. If the search was illegal you may be able to get your case thrown out.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","biosh0cked5150","36875","2014-04-16T13:07:09","Legal defense of a PID charge, need legal advice","Discussion/Legal","Hi guys,  So here's a post I just made regarding me getting arrested recently... shit's bad, yo.   I was charged with Possession w/ intent to Distribute heroin (or an opium-related compound), Unlawful Possession of a Controlled Substance containing psilocybin or cocaine (psilocybin mushrooms in this case), and paraphernalia for either the scale, the syringes, the hash pen, you get the idea. Lots of paraphernalia was confiscated, but only one charge.  My question is this: I was charged with PID for the heroin, which claims that there were more than 2 but less than 4 grams of heroin. I know for a fact that I had less than 100mg of heroin, but I did have in my possession about 3 grams of methamphetamine (which was confiscated by the arresting officers). The LEOs have been telling my attorney that I had 3 grams of heroin, which I did not have, but I did have ~3 grams of meth. The warrant for the PID charge is specific in that it says the substance was either heroin, opium, a salt of opium, or morphine.  Since I only had a residual amount of heroin but a large amount of methamphetamine, is it possible (or advisable) to fight the PID charge and have it reduced to a lesser possession charge? One look at the bag of heroin residue will clearly show that it is less than the 3 grams it was claimed to be. However, if it is possible to be retroactively charged for a crime then the LEOs would probably reduce that charge but then charge me with PID for the meth. I just don't really know if I should be trying to argue against their claim that I had 3 grams of heroin.  I have not spoken with law enforcement to any degree, I have not been contacted, no one has attempted to question me, and any attempts to divulge information from me will be useless because I refuse to give any information about this community to the people who wish to destroy it. I just want to know if I can fight the PID charge.","Just an update that biosh0cked will not be around for a while...I got arrested AND hospitalized the weekend before last, got 2 felony drug charges plus paraphernalia... My family found out everything about both my drug usage and drug dealing. They're heartbroken. I'm just lucky that they love me or else I'd still be sitting in county jail trying to figure out how to post a $30,000+ bail.I'm supposed to be keeping this info under wraps but obviously this is a place of comfort and community for me... just make sure that you guys NEVER cut corners on opsec and NEVER put yourself at risk for arrest. I was not raided, no one figured out that I was using a darknet market, I simply got too fucked up and passed out... I was at the mercy of the police.I am being told that I may not be able to get sentenced to drug court (which would be ideal), because one of my charges was Possession w/ Intent to Distribute. My lawyer tells me that normally the detective would try to flip me and get my supplier, but since I have no idea who/where my supplier really is, I am at the mercy of the DA in terms of being sent to drug court versus facing the charges in district court. I would most likely get a suspended drivers' license and 1year+ of probation in district court, but that would leave me with a felony conviction on my criminal record. Not ideal.Just keep me in your thoughts guys, learn from my experience. Just don't fucking get caught, I learned firsthand how fucked up our drug laws are and how badly they need to be changed. However, for the foreseeable future I will not be using or selling any more because I cannot afford to take any more risks.You have nothing to be worried about if you are or have ever associated with me as a friend or business partner, if you have any words of reassurance then just PM me. I'm kinda depressed about it all, predictably.Sorry for putting that kind of damper on the thread, I hope I didn't ruin anyone's day. Peace and love to each and every one of you.EDIT: All this being said, I will NEVER turn against the people here. This community is proof that the drug laws should be abolished, and I would never do anything to assist, inform, or cooperate with local or federal law enforcement. I'm basically making my attorney keep all LEOs involved from speaking to me, I may have gotten popped but I have my own set of morals and loyalty is worth more than lawfulness in my mind."

This company is going to get bitcoin companies to voluntarily hand over the personal details of people who purchase items with bitcoins, purchase bitcoins or use bitcoins with companies that are in the business of buying/selling bitcoins or accepting bitcoins.  They are going to create a database of who owns which wallet addresses.  Bitcoins that are proceeds of any crime or used for any crime will be blacklisted.  Bitcoins that have been through Silk Road or used to buy drugs will be blacklisted.   Tumbled coins will be blacklisted.  Regulators in the US and possibly other countries are waiting for such a database to exist so that they can require all companies in their jurisdiction to only accept payments from customers whose identities can be fully tracked.  You will not be able to cash out blacklisted bitcoins on any exchange or purchase any goods with them and no one will want to accept them because their bitcoin address will then be blacklisted and their bitcoins can be too.  The evil company doing this is Coin Validation (www.coinvalidation.com) which is owned by Yifu Guo, the same person who owns/created Avalon ASIC.     Countermeasures   Use and create non-US alternatives: It's virtually certain that every US-based Bitcoin company, as well as any company backed by venture capital firms, as well as any currency exchange which deals with USD is going to sign on to this plan. Bitcoin users who wish to retain their privacy should avoid dealing with all of these companies, as well as create alternatives that are based outside the United States and not susceptible to political pressure.   Mobilize the international Bitcoin community: Non-US Bitcoin users should demand that Bitcoin companies in their countries respect their privacy and refuse to participate in this or any other surveillance scheme.   Use privacy-enhancing technology: Protocols like CoinJoin (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0), if properly implemented and used,  can render the information in this database useless. Anyone who cares about financial privacy should ask the developers of their wallet software to implement this ASAP.  Practice good Bitcoin hygiene by never using the same address twice.  Help fund the development of DarkWallet (https://darkwallet.unsystem.net/)   Abandon traditional businesses: There's no point in lobbying traditional businesses based in the US and other repressive regimes to resist this kind of pressure. They are too vulnerable to pressure (http://bitcoinmagazine.com/6386/trust-no-us-companies-with-the-future-of-bitcoin/) and are going to do whatever the regulators tell them to do.  They are, however, in no way essential to the future of Bitcoin.  The economy of the future is System D (http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/28/black_market_global_economy). Traditional businesses with their physical offices, corporate charters, bank accounts and licenses are holdovers of a dying paradigm. We should focus instead on creating tools to empower individuals to create censorship-resistant business models (http://bitcoinism.blogspot.com/2013/11/censorship-resistant-business-models.html).  We will not build a bridge to the future by conforming to the past. While it's unfortunate that traditional Bitcoin businesses are trapped in a position where they must cripple the features of the currency in order to be allowed to operate, we as a community must continue to move forward even if it means leaving them behind.     Yifu Guo is a scamming piece of shit. http://btcbible.com/concern-grows-avalon-asic-scam/ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=165105.0 http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/engineering-the-bitcoin-gold-rush-an-interview-with-yifu-guo-creator-of-the-first-asic-based-miner http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/13/sanitizing-bitcoin-coin-validation/     Someone by the username of Rudd-O is here to help! www.rudd-o.com     ","A PLEDGE: I invite you to help us stop the threats to Bitcoin fungibilityGiven the recent developments that the Bitcoin community is aware of,and whereas these threats can effectively destroy billions of dollars of your own hard-earned value, unless the owners of that value decide to surrender, fold, and snitch on themselves,I have decided to make a pledge, and invite you to join me in helping you protect your identity and the value of your savings.This pledge has two parts. I will start a fork the official Bitcoin-QT client, if toxic fungibility-destructive functionality is committed into itIf the original client gains any code that generates doubt about received coin origins, such as the functionality suggested by Mike HearnThen I will fork the source code and invite all core and non-core developers to continue there.The team behind this independent fork will maintain full compatibility with the specs as implemented today, but it will alter any coin-tracking functionality such that any coins marked ""from a dubious source"" by the original client will be marked as ""good"", coins marked as ""clean"" will be marked as ""tracked, dangerous"" and the rest will be marked as ""unencumbered"" or ""untracked"" or some such.This flips the table on the irreparable antisocial damage that such a malicious insider attack on the original client can do, invalidating the attackers' efforts.We will **not* fork the block chain. Your coins will be able to be used with either version of the client. We will maintain the standard distributed and replicated QA and release system to guarantee that your client won't be tampered with. You will not lose any money that you would not lose with the obsolete and compromised client. I will start a system to track anyone who partakes of CoInvalidation's scheme, if this beast catches onIf the cabal of taint-lickers attempting to get CoInvalidation up and running succeed in getting even a single duped customer on boardedThen I will start a system to track these customers and inform us in real time. I will also contribute as many resources as it is financially possible for me, and I will invite others to do so as well.The newly-formed team will use these resources to help maintain a brownlist of people who cooperate with their scheme, both brick-and-mortar and online.We will also maintain a browser extension that will mark their online presences as untrustworthy for the reasons aforementioned.The brownlist will be crowdsourced. People will be able to report businesses as co-conspirators in the scheme. People will also be able to confirm claims and report businesses as having abandoned the CoInvalidation scheme, thereby bringing them back into good standing with the community.This allows people to vote with their coins and protect them from deals that require them to snitch on themselves and track their identities in centralized databases maliciously. Social action is the only practical way to stop antisocial action. You and I can make a difference without petitions or any other ineffective actions.Upvotes are good, but they are not enough. This is why I decided to promise a part of my life to make this a reality. And I hope you can help us too. The least you can do is to share this with others. However, you can also be involved personally, and that is even better. If you maintain a Bitcoin related codebase, you are hereby invited to join the effort by talking to us and rejecting insider attacks on your codebase.This actionable warning is the first response to stem these threats, and should be enough to make them recant. If they won't, we will execute this plan. If my theories about human action and human decency are correct, we will win. So, let us, you and I, show the world that we will not tolerate venal and irresponsible strangers threatening to destroy our money, and by extension, our personal and our families' lives.;I believe it is worth exposing each person in this new Coin Validation team. Yifu is a dishonest criminal of bitcoins, dollars, time, and his actions speak to a nefarious character. Google him, it's been covered.Well, what about the other guys? The coin purse, cofounder, and government connections guy is Matthew Mellon.First, let me preface this with saying Matt has really great family lawyers. They have attacked (and removed) a lot of articles exposing him and reporting on his past. If you report on this on your blog, he will send legal to come after you.So, who is Matt?Matthew Mellon is part of one of Americaâs most influential and wealthy families â with ties like Gulf Oil, Carnegie Mellon University and Alcoa. Matthew inherited a $25 million trust fund at only 21, and started blowing it on cocaine, guns, celebrity company, and whatever other ridiculous or dangerous things he could get his hands on. He almost overdosed, and instead of reforming, he divorced his wife went back to hit the slopes some more. He fired his next fiancee, and left her financially dry, only to jump to another woman shortly after.Some stuff Marrhew Mellon has done that went public:Matthew Mellon historically had a nasty breakup which exposed his crack, cocaine, and business embezzlement. - http://www.theweek.co.uk/people/38861/matthew-mellon-fights-%C2%A330m-law-suit-brought-ex-girlfriend-noelle?WTmc_id=rssMatthew Mellon is friends enough with this ex-Paris Hilton boyfriend asshat, having borrowed him funds which also funded Brandon's drug use. - Matthew Mellon was likely involved in a hacking scandal which his lawyers cleaned up nicely. The problem with making a website also apologize is it leaves traces. - http://www.zdnet.com/matthew-mellon-apology-3039251750/Matthew Mellon also threatened lawsuit to take another article down here. ""the wealthy Matthew Mellon thought they needn't act as average people, so instead they've, through their attorneys, tried to scare us."" - https://news.hitb.org/content/xatrixorg-threathened-lawsuitA report still up shows that Matthew Mellon allegedly hired wire-tapping on his ex-wife. Do you trust him with your validation? On further research, he was arrested and charged. - http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133761030.htmlFor you political folks, I will let you make your own decision on Matthew Mellon's contributions to Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. He has donated both separately (majorly to Ryan) and combined. This includes the defunding of Medicare and Medicaid. - http://www.nclr.org/images/uploads/pages/HCRCall042711_Transcript.pdf "

At best they can find coins that no effort was taken in obscuring.This is why they are creating a database of addresses and owners.  If this becomes mandatory as planned....  If the owner of the address where the bitcoins came from is unknown then the bitcoins are tainted until it is known.  If the bitcoins are known to be used in a crime (think of all of the records of bitcoins and addresses from Silk Road that the feds now have) then those bitcoins are permanently tainted.  Pretty much the only clean bitcoins that we would be left with would be ones that were mined and hoarded or sold by miners legitimately and hoarded and never seen Silk Road or been send through a mixing/tumbling service.  All of Yifu Guo's (the owner of Coin Validation and Avalon ASIC) bitcoins would fall into this category of clean bitcoins.  His bitcoins would hold a large value while tainted coins are pretty much worthless."

The bribe could be 6 figures and ya may not get someone to bite for that. whereas blackmailing them (either by using info gained through hacking or some other blackmail) they would be forced to agree and cooperate. We could still give them some small compensation. I would think at least a few LEO' out there have CP on computers, or have a personal amount of drugs. They could be having an affair and communicate with their mistress via email, in which case a capable hacker on here would be able to find traces of that.   Someone may be able to plant something illegal on their home computer(s) as well. CP, an SR account, incriminating phony emails.  They will still have to answer for these if 'discovered' and even if they are acquitted, the investigation would costs thousands, shrinking their budget.  If it is possible to charge many anonymous things to a credit card if someone could gain access to one of them. Let them answer for the massive credit card bill. Or the opposite, flood their accounts with thousands and anonymously report them.  I myself do not have the capabilities but i enjoy contributing to this thread.  There is a plethora of things LE could offer us. Whether those things be physical goods/services, knowledge and/or things that could be only transferred online. I think LEO would be more compelled to cooperate if they could remain anonymous as well.   If we develop a method that works very well, it could potentially be used to corrupt whole departments.

Product  If you're looking to become a vendor then one of the most important steps is to secure a constant supply of the product that you wish to start vending, if you don't secure a decent 'connect' then you face having problems further down the road (pun intended), you could end up building a solid customer base only to lose your product supply, you can't make money without product!  You should also do a bit of research before committing to vending, have a look to see what the average price of the product is going for, if you're unable to compete with the prices then you should look into selling a different product. Competition is fierce on DNMs!   Money  Another important step to be becoming a good vendor is to have a cash out method, if you don't have a solid way to cash out your funds then you won't be able to re-supply on product - this can cause you to lose your loyal customer base!  You'll obviously need to find a cash out method that works for you as it may vary from country-to-country, you don't want to find yourself with a wallet full of Bitcoin and in desperate need of product only to find yourself with no safe method to cash out your funds - you may end up getting desperate and using an unsafe method which may get you caught!   Stealth  Having good packaging is extremely important, it will reduce the chance of your packages being seized by customs. It will also help build your customer base as customers are more likely to order from a vendor who takes the time to make sure their packages are as discreet as possible.    Vendor Profile  I hate it when I see a vendor who doesn't take the time to write a decent vendor profile, it seriously affects the amount of orders that they receive. Buyers are going to think twice about ordering from you if you don't even take the time to write a decent profile!  Here's a quick template that you can use if you don't currently have a well-written vendor profile:   It's very basic but it's better than nothing!   Pictures  Having decent product pictures will help you gain trust as a new vendor, it shows that you have the product ready to ship, it also allows the buyer to see what they're buying!  Please make sure you know how to safely upload pictures, you should check out the 'Security' board if you're unsure: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?board=2.0   Forum Presence  As a new vendor it can be tough getting sales, this is why the forum is a great tool to utilize. If your budget permits, you should create a review thread and start offering free samples (i.e. 1g of cannabis), this will give potential buyers a chance to sample your product and also give you a detailed review. Not only are they testing your product but also your stealth & shipping time.  If word gets around that your product is great then you'll start receiving orders in no time and you'll also start building that all important customer base.   Communication  Communication is key to becoming a successful vendor, most of the time you'll never need to communicate with a customer that has ordered from you (unless there is a problem with their address) but there are times when you will need to communicate with your buyers, this could be for the following reasons:  Shipping delays - If you're experiencing shipping delays then you should immediately let your customers know, otherwise you face the risk of losing them as a customer and it will damage your reputation!  New products - If you've introduced a new product to your store then let your customers know about it (via the forum)!  Offline - If you're going to be offline for a long period of time then let your customers know about it (obviously don't be specific as that isn't good OPSEC), if they're aware of your upcoming vacation then they can purchase a larger amount of product to last them until you get back, if you don't let them know then they may go elsewhere and you risk losing them as a customer!   Jargon  On marketplaces such as Silk Road, customers tend to use words that you may not understand (especially if your native language isn't English)  Here are some of the more common words:  OPSEC = Operational Security  Packs = Package / Parcel ETA = Estimated Time of Arrival  If you don't speak English but your target customer is from a country where the native language is English then you may want to brush up on your language skills as this will help you communicate with your customers!

It's frustrating when a vendor lists a new product with a photo attached, the buyer makes a purchase because it looks so good and inviting only to find that when it arrives it looks nothing like the product pictured in the photo of the vendor's listing, sometimes not even close. It's all about being honest and transparent with your customers so they literally get what they were looking at and subsequently payed for. I don't think that's much to ask from a vendor but others may feel differently.   Please note that some vendors do the right thing and post photos of their current batches into the listings on their vendor page but from my experience, there's a hell of a lot who don't do it. ",""

Part of a great post by cerdo in the main Discussion forum: ","Can't speak to markets, but I know a bit about i2p.It's not all that different from Tor, but some of the differences are appealing:1. Every i2p user (who wants a decent experience) routes traffic for other i2p users.  This makes it more difficult for adversaries to identify what traffic *you* are sending, since your IP is also sending traffic for me.2. Peer to Peer works much better.   Tor is built on a model where you are either a client OR a server.   i2p blurs that line to a greater degree.3. It's built for hidden services.. that's really what it's made for.  4. It has large amounts of torrent traffic running across it.  Which is decent cover traffic.5. It has some interesting services built on top of it.  i2p bote is an intriguing messaging option.  The user experience is a little different.   Fire-and-forget clients don't fare as well on i2p.. if you're not willing to stay connected nearly 24/7, you don't get much bandwidth, and the whole experience sucks.   So instead of firing up Tails at a coffee shop to hop on Tor, serious i2p users are connected, from home, 24/7. Security-focused clients on Tor tend to focus on isolation.. making sure your browser stays within Tor.  But since i2p doesn't do a good job getting you to the clearnet (there's no concept of exit nodes.. and I think they're down to one out-proxy), users will have to rethink how they set things up.   It's not too hard to set up a hybrid solution that will get you to i2p, and send all your other traffic via Tor.What I like about i2p's model (everybody routes for everybody) is that everybody pays their own way, without exchanging cash.   Contribute more bandwidth, get better service. Don't want to contribute any bandwidth?  That's weird, it sucks.It's also more resource-intensive.  i2p is written in Java, so it uses significantly more resources (memory in particular) than a compact, C-based Tor process.   The Java-based server code probably has more attack surface than the Tor process.. Security-wise, i2p is more of an unknown.  It hasn't had the academic focus that Tor has, so there isn't a lot of information available like there is with Tor.   i2p should be somewhat more difficult for a passive global adversary to monitor effectively.  But not significantly hard *enough* that they couldn't do it if they set their minds to it.   It's not a silver bullet, but it's different enough that they'd need to retool some things if they wanted to stalk it like they do Tor.   It's every bit as succeptible to Sybil attacks (basically, standing up a shitload of malicious nodes) as Tor is, probably more in some ways.   At the old forum, kmfkewm made a comment that the recent Tor botnet could have chosen to fully deanonymize every user if we were talking about i2p, and he was right about that. I don't think it's worse than Tor, and I think it has some advantages.  But it has some downsides, too.;One thing that I am curious about is why we don't hear more about I2P. So far, I have not heard of any markets making use of the I2P network. There is a general lack of penetration testing and security auditing when it comes to I2P compared to Tor, but I would really like to see more interest in I2P. The way this war will be won is ultimately through decentralization. Unfortunately, the technology for a truly decentralized market is just not quite there yet (although there is some interesting progress being made, none of which is public yet, which I think is a double-edged sword).I2P certainly provides a faster and more robust network, and it was designed from the beginning with the goal of hosting anonymous services. Tor is exactly the opposite; being designed to anonymize users and happens to have a feature to allow those anonymous endpoints to host services.It seems that the packet-switched nature of I2P (vs the circuit-switched nature of Tor) and its fully distributed nature makes it a much better candidate overall...On the downside, two big things I2P has against it:*) Serious lack of peer review/auditing*) No idiot-proof out-of-the-box browser bundle (wouldn't be hard to build such a thing though)Has anyone thought about making use of I2P for a next-gen black market?Does anyone have any thoughts on I2P vs. Tor?Sorry for the long, rambling post... Those dexies are talkin' to a nigga... "

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Dread Pirate Roberts","1721","2013-11-01T13:54:22","i2p Discussion: Discussing migrations/coexistence","Discussion/Security","From a market perspective, I2P is not very beneficial. It is stated above that I2P favors clients who offer bandwidth to the overall network and therefore will discriminate those unable to do so, particularly when we consider most Tor users simply log in and then turn it off when they are done since I2P needs time to propagate throughout the network to pick up ""circuits"" as the Tor comparison. Therefore users who are not always connected will find it more difficult to connect to a market site which can significantly deter a new userbase or those not involved in the community and simply want to make a purchase.  I2P is also designed for activities such as hidden sites, torrenting and a manner of other issues you wouldn't want to do over clearnet and for this reason could be further portrayed in the media as a true darknet which has limited purpose for legitimate establishments. If the network is unable to maintain a legitimate cover also this can very easily pit politicians against it and could eventually put it in the same position torrenting is in for example whereby ISP's will threaten to cut connections if users are found as part of the network, where Tor would be a harder structure to do this against since it can blend into regular traffic better than I2P at the moment.",""

The usual Tor client model (TBB<Tails<Whonix<Qubes<Physical Isolation) has to change somewhat with i2p.  1. How secure/insecure should we all view the i2p Java router process as? It's definitely miles more code than Tor, and it's Java.   Should it be isolated from the host machine more than the Tor process is?  2. i2p is easy to mix with Tor.  A proxy server (privoxy/etc) can send *.i2p requests to the i2p router, and everything else to Tor.   Or a browser can do it with FoxyProxy or the like.   Are there anonymity implications to being on both networks at once?  3. At the point where users are staying connected to i2p 24x7, what's the right setup for clients?   How much should they isolate?  I almost wonder if, given the complexity of dual i2p/Tor for many users, it's not easier to pick a cheap hardware platform (Raspberry Pi / CubieBoard / BeagleBone Black) and build a middlebox Tor/i2p node for physical isolation.    Has anybody played with i2p bote?  I don't care at all for the idea of the messaging app on the i2p router, but it looks like a decent Kademlia DHT-based messaging system.  Just looks like it'd make isolating the i2p router complicated.

Establish a VPN to somewhere, then 2. Use onion.to or another Tor2Web gateway to get to the forums.  i.e. you get here by going to silkroad5v7dywlc.onion.to instead of via silkroad5v7dywlc.onion  Then the primary problem is the Tor2Web gateway.  There's nothing stopping them from harvesting your forum credentials, and you're sticking them in the middle of your conversation for no good reason.  You can argue that the Tor2Web gateway is blind to your real IP, because you're using VPN.   But that becomes an exercise in how well a VPN provides anonymity, and the answer to that is always ""By itself, a VPN doesn't provide much anonymity"".  If you're accessing the forum through the .onion.to address even over Tor, you're still screwed, because the Tor2Web gateway can still harvest your credentials.  Your source address is anonymized, but they still get to see everything you do on the forums.  They just view you as coming from a Tor exit node, but they can see all your forum content, unencrypted.  A good rule of thumb is: Never use onion.to or any Tor2Web gateway.   Ever.

A successful login DOES NOT clean this.- Mobile Nr. changes will take 2 days to take effect, during this time a warning will be displayed on the top of the site allowing you to cancel the change at anytime.- Email changes will generate two outgoing messages, one to the new address to verify, other to the old address with a link to revoke the change. Revocation has priority over confirmation.- Withdraws and escrow releases require an OTC to be sent by SMS, this code will have a cost accordingly to the current fee (sorry, hadn't find a place to send free SMS's) for withdraws but it's free in escrow releases (I take it from the 5% selling fee).Done so far:- Basic user registering and account management.- Listing creation- Live exchange rates- Deposit and withdraw functionsTo do before open for business:- Review the design- Listing pages (currently being done)- SSL Certificate- Search functions- Buying functions- Feedback system"

OpenPGP (the format that GnuPG implements) primarily supports RSA, ElGamal and DSA; ElGamal is encrypt-only, while DSA is sign-only. RSA can do both; however, there was a time when RSA was still patented, and since that time some PGP implementations have taken the habit of defaulting to ElGamal+DSA, hence necessarily two key pairs.   2. Encryption keys should be escrowed (i.e. have backup somewhere), while signature keys should not. See this answer for a discussion on this subject. Since a given key cannot be both escrowed and not escrowed, you should need two keys.   3. Ideally, you should have a single master key, that you keep in a specially well protected keyring, and subkeys for daily tasks. The master key is supposed to be your ""root"" key with no expiry date; it is large and bulky and possibly inefficient, but you don't use it often. The subkeys may be shorter (thus more efficient) because you define them to have a short lifetime (e.g. one or two years): you don't have to make them fat enough to survive advances in technology one or two decades from now. The master key doubles as ""revocation key"" in case one of your subkeys gets stolen.   "

Steffen, Samuel Candelaria,  2002.   Chapter 4. Use of the Drug Canine in Drug Interdiction   ","A dogâs sense of smell is superior to ours. These animals live in a completely different scent world than we do. We have used these animals to our benefit for many years. We have trained them to track criminals, find people trapped in settings such as collapsed buildings and snow avalanches, find lost children, and search for bombs and drugs.     Why are dogs so proficient in detecting odor compared to humans? The anatomy of a dogâs nose reveals a number of differences from the human nose. When one inhales sharply or sniffs, swirling currents of air are created inside the nasal cavity. This helps carry odors to the olfactory cells, which detect smells. Dogs have about 150 million of these cells, compared to 5 million in humans. The analogy we often use is that the human olfactory bulb is the size of a postage stamp, while in a dog it is about 1 square foot. Dogs also have a nasal cavity volume close to 4 times that of a human, which means dogs have a larger surface area for detecting odor.     Domestic drug interdiction encompasses a wide variety of investigative opportunities with respect to counter-drug efforts. The use of a properly trained drug canine team is absolutely essential in the operation of a domestic drug interdiction group. The police drug canine, when properly trained and handled, provides law enforcement with a competitive edge in traditional narcotic enforcement and the domestic drug interdiction arena.     An abundance of case law exists with respect to the use of the narcotic canine which supports the efforts and operation of an interdiction group. Trained canine teams must remember a number of factors concerning search and seizure, and privacy issues. One key factor is whether the canine team has the legal right to be present at a scene. The question should always be asked not only of the canine team, but of investigators operating in the drug interdiction environment âAm I here lawfully?â                                           Positive canine alerts provide probable cause for search warrants or warrantless searches, depending on the circumstances. The canine team can be used in vehicle examinations, parcel and freight examinations, knock and talk scenarios within a dwelling, business, or hotel/motel, airport, commercial bus operations (in which the drug canine team can examine bags, luggage, interior lockers, and parcels and packages in the bus terminal), and storage unit facilities. These may be random examinations or follow-ups of tip information. The drug canine can be used at airports to examine luggage, interior lockers, and aircraft. A passive alert dog (one that sits when the odor of narcotics is detected) can be used in a variety of settings, such as examining persons, on cruise ships, ship rooms, and in luggage and freight compartments. The dog is an asset in examining hidden compartments in a residence, or finding contraband buried underground.The canine team should be provided with actual drugs for training. A certified drug laboratory should perform quantitative and qualitative analysis of the training drugs for the purpose of court testimony regarding the types of drugs used in training.    Many police agencies train strictly with pseudo drugs. Pseudo drugs can be purchased from laboratories such as Sigma Labs in St. Louis, Missouri, for initial training of new drug dogs, or for other specific drug training. Pseudo drugs mimic the scent of actual drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. Although appropriate in some instances, to mimic potentially toxic drugs such as LSD, the use of only pseudo drugs can cause potential issues in criminal court. It may threaten credibility in courtroom testimony. Thedefense may point out that the dog has been trained and tested with a substance that a suspect was not arrested for.    It is important that the dog is exposed to a variety of different quantities of drugs. This is known as a different âscent pictureâ with different quantities of drugs. A scent picture, for example, of a gram of cocaine versus a kilogram of cocaine is certainly different. The theory is that if the dog can locate a smaller quantity of drugs, then it can certainly identify a much larger quantity. That is not always the case, as these scent pictures are different and can be overwhelming to the dog. It is important to train with a variety of quantities of drugs to be effective. This is where recordkeeping is important. Training drugs should be rotated on a regular basis to provide âfreshâ drugs for training purposes.     Procedures should be in place for storage of training drugs. Security is  the first consideration â where are the drugs to be kept, and are they secure? Another consideration is the separation of drugs so contamination does not occur. Drugs such as marijuana and cocaine should not be stored together to avoid a situation where the canine may alert on the cannabis rather than the cocaine, so true training is not accomplished.     Where do we get drugs to train with? The canine trainer has a number of options. The police agencyâs Property and Evidence section is a source for training drugs. Seized drugs Ã¦ cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, or marijuana can be used for training purposes. Use of these drugs must be documented with the evidence clerk. Procedures should be in place for documentation of the release of the training drugs. Recently seized drugs in a variety of quantities should be used to train with. Documentation of quantities and how the drug was obtained should also be part of training records.     The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issues licenses to possess narcotics for drug canine training. A background investigation, including criminal history, is required for a person applying for a DEA license. DEA requires that the training officer indicate his training background and where the drugs will be stored. A list of all the individuals who will have access to the drugs must be disclosed. Once a license is issued, the trainer can travel freely with the substances. Every police agency should have a DEA registration. Most states have to first go through their state agency, state police, or so on to obtain a state license before receiving a DEA license.     The DEA license is called a Researcherâs License, and is free to law enforcement or government. An annual fee of $70.00 is required for other entities. The license must be renewed annually.Other FactorsCertain factors should be considered when working as a canine team. There are many misconceptions about dealing with dogs. One thing to remember is that a dog is not perfect, and that it will sometimes not find drugs. There must be some scent availability if the properly trained dog is to detect an odor of a drug. The animal is not trained specifically on the drug, but on the odor of the drug. There may be instances where drugs were stored at a location and then removed, and a residual odor is still in place; known as âdead scent.â The dog may alert, but no drugs may be found. The dog actually did its job and located the odor of narcotics. Many fault the canine team for this type of scenario. An analogy for âdead scentâ is the popcorn similarity. If someone is popping popcorn in a room and leaves that room, the odor of popcorn is still present when others walk in. The odor is in the room, but no popcorn is in the room.      On the other hand, if there is no scent available, the dog will not alert. Many times odor is not available. Drug traffickers and organizations go to a great deal of trouble to mask the odor of narcotics. They use a variety of different masking agents such as coffee, scented dryer sheets, axle grease, motor oil, peanut butter, and so on to try to prevent the animal from detecting the drug odor.      It is permissible for the handler to push on a bag, parcel, or piece of luggage to extract air. This is commonly known as âburpingâ or âbreathingâ the item. This provides the drug canine with an opportunity to detect the odor of narcotics. The officer cannot manipulate the bag, to enable him to feel the contents. This has been deemed by some courts as intrusive, and constitutes a search.      In the majority of cases, the properly trained dog will alert on the odor of narcotics. The dog has the ability of scent discrimination. It will run through all of the available masking agents, key in on the narcotic odor, and alert. The analogy many use is the âbeef stewâ description. When you come home from work and walk into your house and smell beef stew, you recognize it as just that. A trained narcotic canine also smells the beef stew, but can differentiate between the odors of carrots, peas, potatoes, celery, and beef. This is the difference between the ability of a properly trained dog and human ability.      Sometimes there is no scent available in a particular environment. A good example is parcel/package investigations. Drug traffickers will essentially remove the odor and the availability of the scent by extracting all of the air from the package. They may vacuum seal the substance. In this case, it is virtually impossible for the dog to alert on a particular suspected parcel. However, with time the odor will permeate through the packaging, depending on the volatility of the drug, and will become available. Sometimes drug traffickers may inadvertently contaminate a parcel, and in this case the dog will alert on the residual odor left by the person handling the package or other effects. A properly trained dog is extremely effective and should not be criticized if it sometimes misses drugs.     Current court case law is related directly to drug detection teams for the search and seizure of evidence. There is a purpose for conducting good legal searches. Bad searches can have a far-reaching negative effect on the use of a canine. The canine team must know the legal areas of deployment that dictate how the dog can be deployed in each search situation. Unfortunately, a lot of pressure is placed on handlers by co-workers during deployment. Law enforcement officers certainly want to locate drugs and make good cases. The added pressure to a canine team when told, âWe know there are drugs in thereâ makes it difficult for them. The canine handler must be consistent and not be swayed by officers trying to convince him there are drugs in a particular location when the dog is not alerting."

","Currency ExaminationsInevitably, the drug canine will alert to currency. The quantities of currency will vary and will be in a variety of situations and environments. A parcel/package could contain a quantity of cash or the dog alerts on a piece of luggage containing money. Drug dogs are not trained to alert to the odor of money. However, if there is contamination of the currency by the drug trafficker, the dog is alerting to the odor of narcotics. This can easily happen when a trafficker handles drugs and the money or the cash is in proximity to the drugs.     Dr. Kenneth G. Furton, professor at Florida International University, Department of Chemistry, Miami, Florida, an expert in the fields of analytical chemistry and forensic chemistry, has done extensive research with respect to the theory that all U.S. currency is innocently contaminated with drugs, specifically microscopic quantities of cocaine. 1 He found that this premise is incorrect. This opinion is based on reasonable scientific certainty. His research and analysis have indicated that the odor of the controlled substance dissipates with time. A drug canine alerts on the odor of methyl benzoate, the dominant odor of cocaine. Methyl benzoate is a highly volatile substance and evaporates very quickly when handled and/or exposed to air. He believes that if a properly trained narcotics canine alerts on currency that has recently been in proximity to a significant quantity of drugs such as cocaine, it is not the result of innocent environmental contamination of circulated U.S. currency by microscopic traces of cocaine. His studies have also shown that properly trained drug canines have consistently not alerted to large quantities of U.S. currency.     It is imperative that the handler document all currency finds and times when the dog does not alert to money as well. This could be under various conditions, such as money in a vehicle, pocket, purse, or other location where money is located and the dog does not alert. The handler can then testify that the drug canine does not always alert to money.Person Examinations and Passive Alert DogsMany agencies have used passive alert dogs (dogs that will sit when alerting to drugs) to conduct searches on people in a variety of environments. Such locations include airport, bus, and train terminals. The courts are divided on this issue. It appears that the majority of courts have ruled that a canine examination of a person, whether random or by design, is a search. Only a passive alert dog should be used to examine persons. An aggressive alert dog should never be used for this purpose.     Many courts indicate that âreasonable suspicionâ is required to conduct an examination of a person for narcotic odor. There is case law relating to the examination of people in a variety of settings. It is suggested that domestic drug investigation groups contact their state or district attorneyâs office to research case law in a particular jurisdiction concerning this issue. If an agency is working with the U.S. Attorneyâs office in a particular district, the agent should contact that office to research federal case law regarding this issue.     Several cases of note that outline the issues of people examinations are divided on the practice. In Horton v. Goose Creek Independent School District, 690 F.2d 470, (1982), Fifth Circuit, the court indicated that a canine sniffing students was a search under the Fourth Amendment, and that canine searches of students could not be justified without reasonable suspicion. This particular environment was a school in which officers used a dog to conduct examinations of students.     In Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91 (1980), Seventh Circuit, the court ruled that walking up aisles and sniffing by a narcotic detector dog did not violate studentsâ rights. It was found that a dog sniff of students is not a search. This case is in direct opposition to Horton v. Goose Creek.     In B.C. v. Plumas Unified School District, 192 F.3d 1260 (1999), Ninth Circuit, the court agreed with the Horton case. A dog sniff of a person infringes on a reasonable expectation of privacy and constitutes asearch. A random and suspicionless dog sniff search of a person is unreasonable.    There may be less of an expectation of privacy in a mass transit area, such as an airport, bus terminal, or train station. It is not recommended that a passive alert dog be used to examine persons in an area such as a street corner, full of people. Some parts of the country are more liberal on the issue of people examinations than others. It is important that the drug canine team stay current with changes in case law.    The question is frequently asked âDoes the use of a canine constitute a search?â In the case U.S. v. Place, 462 U.S. 696 (1983), the court indicated that the use of a drug detection canine is not considered a search. The canine either proves or disproves only the presence of a narcotic odor. The use of a canine does not expose the contents of the bag to the general public. A number of cases side with the Place case, which indicates that the use of a canine is not a search.    Another factor that should be noted is the delay in the use of the canine, such as if the canine is summoned from a distant location. Depending on the particular circumstances in which the canine team is operating, during domestic drug investigations the delay and the deployment of the dog should be considered a factor. The courts are divided as far as the actual time of delay â anywhere from 30 to 80 minutes is not considered unreasonable."

If you want to spend just $25/month, you can run five relays yourself. The more relays the community runs, the lower percentage the NSA eavesdrop on (assuming the NSA owns relays, which I'm quite confident they do).It's not illegal to run a relay. You  can run one under your real name. I will repost Astor's instructions if anyone is interested in running a relay.Otherwise, contribute to projects that create relays.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","whom","381","2013-10-12T15:09:21","Admins: Create Private Technical Forum","Discussion/Security","A few comments on security and darknets.. I don't know shit (and I'm not really interested) in other aspects that traditionally filled SRF's Security forum, like shipping goods, etc, so I can't speak to those.    There aren't any secrets in security.   It's technology, and for anything you're actually relying on, how it works should be the opposite of a secret.. it should be right there in front of you (and everyone else), in source code form.  A solid foundation in mathematics and systems engineering is what you build anonymous security around.  Basic security isn't a secret.  Learning good OPSEC, appropriately compartmentalizing identities, building yourself a stable client platform to interact with this place and others, learning to use PGP.  Moving beyond basic security isn't a secret, either.   As a matter of fact, the foundation of more advanced security is the more perfect execution of basic security concepts.   There's not some ""Now that you know PGP, it's time to use quantum cryptography to separate message particles"" fork in the road where suddenly you're using super ninja tools.  Smart people start with the basic security concepts and improve on them.. but in the case of personal security on darknets, this is a function of really *understanding* the available attack surface that you are presenting, understanding the true risks that you face, and finding ways to improve on basic security concepts to try to distance yourself from the other people you're being grouped together with.  You're trying to be the fastest gazelle that the lions are chasing.   One of the core tenets of information security has always been that obscurity isn't security.   This is true at a basic level, but it gets a little less true the farther you move down the path of thinking about the risks you face when you're logging in here and elsewhere.   You want to avoid broad nets meant to capture the masses, but at the same time, you want to make sure you don't stand out obviously from the masses.  This requires a strong understanding of the tradeoffs of available methods and technologies, and the ability to decide on an acceptable level of risk.   Then you combine methods and technologies to manage that risk.  How does a private security forum help everybody move down that path?  You'd be a fool to share any more in a ""private"" forum than you do in a ""public"" one.  As a matter of fact, long-term, sharing more information in a private forum is probably more dangerous, because it's so easy to lose sight of the fact that a ""private"" forum is never ever private.  No matter what security you wrap around it (a group sharing a PGP key, kmf's PIR ideas from the old forum, etc), it's a group full of individuals, one of whom will inevitably be involved in some enterprise *other* than just discussing security, and the next thing you know, through that compromised member, the contents of the private forum are no longer as private as its members thought it was.  If administration wants to make a private security forum, its primary purpose should be to keep discussions of attack vectors, weaknesses in methods, etc off of the scrapable, public forums, since Google will eventually index them via a tor2web proxy.   But after reading through the entirety of the old forum's Security section, I can say that I didn't once come across anything that would give an adversary a truely new or unique method for attacking users.  What I saw was a huge base of discussions that, if the reader wanted to take the time to read them all, provide a nearly-incomparable point of reference for learning about all aspects of security and technology as it relates to anonymity.  Building hidden services is probably the one area where I've never found a frank, comprehensive discussion around technologies.  I think that's largely because there's really only a handful of people on Earth building hidden services that have the huge exposure that a FH, Tormail,  or SR face.   Two of those people are in jail right now, BTW.  Right now, I see a lot of people flocking to forums, coming up with increasingly elaborate ideas for bulletproof hidden services.  The discussion of the internal details of scalable hidden services probably *do* gain something from the obscurity of not discussing it in public, because those services will be targetted *individually* by their attackers.  With client security, nobody is hellbent on specifically finding that ""whom"" guy, but they are hellbent on shutting down that one specific hidden service right now.    Hidden services that piss the US government off don't have to outrun the other gazelles, they have to fight the lion directly.  And that's quite a fucking lion.  Just don't ever make the mistake of thinking that a ""private"" forum full of anonymous people is any less public than a public forum.   And if the administration decides to create a private forum for detailed technical discussion, one of its goals should be to take the output of that discusssion and present it to the public forums as tutorials, HOWTOS, etc. ",""

Once you select that, it will reboot your computer and tails should load.  Hope this helps, and that I didn't miss anything.  Booting tails from Win 8 is a ridiculous first procedure.  Message me if you have any problems.Best of luck.-TThat was actually a pretty impressive write-up.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Nightcrawler","7879","2013-12-11T18:08:40","gpg password security","Discussion/Security"," Because digital signatures have a property known as non-repudiation.  When you sign a file or document, it is done with your private key, which is supposed to be very closely held. Anyone with your public key can verify the signature is valid. Once a signature is shown to be valid, you simply CANNOT deny it as a forgery, or somehow claim that you didn't write it. The original DPR is going to find this out to his chagrin at his upcoming trial.  On the original Forum, DPR PGP-clearsigned dozens of messages over the lifetime of the Forum -- the last was just a few days prior to the bust of Silk Road.  If the Feds found the private half of DPR's key on the laptop they seized from him, then he is inextricably tied  to those messages that were signed. It will simply NOT be possible to explain-away those PGP-signed messages (with valid signatures) as forgeries.  The Feds will have proof-positive that Ross was the author.   If someone sends a PGP-encrypted order to a vendor, and it isn't signed, then one still has plausible deniability -- anyone could have sent in that order as anyone can use anyone else's public key(s) to encrypt messages or traffic with.  However, only the private key holder can  sign messages with the private key. So, in other words, when you PGP-sign an address or an order, you are essentially making a digitally-signed confession to trafficking in contraband.

The new laws â the first of many national security reforms â began being debated in the Senate on Tuesday and had previously been sent to a committee for public consultation.  But the 13 recommendations made to government last week by the powerful Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security concerning the legislation â which it examined and held public hearings on â have not satisfied the Australian Lawyers Alliance, university academics, the Greens, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance and digital rights group Electronic Frontiers Australia. Greens Senator Scott Ludlam says he and his party will not support the bill.  They say the recommendations do not address grave concerns they hold about the bill giving ASIO the power to monitor the entire internet with just one warrant and restricting what journalists write.  The committee's recommendations to the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2014 have been accepted by the government in full.  It is understood the associated government amendments, announced on Friday, were circulated to Labor earlier than to other parties and independent senators, who received them on Tuesday when they were tabled in parliament. One of those amendments, announced on Monday by Attorney-General George Brandis and new ASIO chief Duncan Lewis, explicitly rules out ""torture"" being conducted by intelligence officers. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus didn't initially support some of the new laws.  Labor has indicated that if all amendments are adopted it is likely to pass the bill. This means the laws will pass even if there is crossbench opposition.  But Professor George Williams of UNSW said the laws and their amendments did not address serious concerns they could enable agencies to tap, access and disrupt target and third-party computers and networks across Australia after getting just one warrant.  Dr Williams previously warned the PJCIS that the laws were too broad and could allow ASIO to monitor the entire Australian internet as a ""computer network"", as defined in the new laws. Tourist attraction: An armed AFP officer maintains guard outside Parliament House in Canberra as debate over new national security legislation began in the Senate.   ""The problem is [this specific new law regardless of amendments] applies to computer networks and the internet is a computer network â it's a network of networks,"" he said.  Jon Lawrence, of digital rights group Electronic Frontiers Australia, agreed.  ""I think the drafting of this is so vague that it really could be extended,"" he said. Duncan Lewis, the new ASIO chief, was introduced by Senator Brandis on Monday when the minister announced he would explicitly rule out ""torture"" under new national security legislation.   ""A network can essentially be anything from three computers on a Wi-Fi modem to potentially an entire corporate network or an entire internet service provider network or at the extreme end the whole internet,"" he said.  Dr Williams suggested the warrant process should be restricted to only accessing parts of a computer network necessary to gather intelligence.  ""I accept that [agencies] should be able to access [a university or another organisation's computer] network but it should be strictly limited to those parts of the network to gain the intelligence on a particular [target],"" he said. Christopher Warren, federal secretary of the journalist union, the MEAA, does not support the new laws.  Dr Williams also said section 35P â which jails people who ""recklessly"" reveal information related to a ""special intelligence operation"" (SIO) â would have a ""chilling effect"" on journalists and whistleblowers attempting to disclose information. Professor George Williams of UNSW says the laws are too broad.  The lawyer for whistleblower and former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Jesselyn Radack, has previously labelled the legislation as ""draconian"" and ""chilling"" while NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake said they reminded him of his trial and would result in self-censorship by disclosers.  The legislation makes it an offence if a person ""discloses information ... [that] relates to a special intelligence operation"" and does not state any public interest exemptions, meaning it could apply to anyone including journalists.  Those who disclosed such information would face up to 10 years' jail.  A PJCIS recommendation adopted by the government does, however, allow the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and lawyers to be informed of the information for media or whistleblowers seeking legal advice, but not anyone else.  Dr Williams was supported in his opposition to section 35P by a group of media organisations, including AAP, the ABC, APN, Fairfax Media, FreeTV, News Corp and others, who said in a joint submission to the PJCIS in August that 35P should ""not be included in the legislation"".  ""[Its] insertion ... could potentially see journalists jailed for undertaking and discharging their legitimate role in a modern democratic society â reporting in the public interest,"" they said.  Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus initially appeared to oppose 35P, saying in August that the way it was drafted then meant it was ""not necessary"".  ""It is an unprecedented overreach of government power which poses a real threat to the freedom of the press,"" Dreyfus said.  On Tuesday his spokeswoman said he was now satisfied with it given government amendments.  ""These changes balance the need to protect the safety of ASIO employees engaged in SIOs, while ensuring that journalists are not in danger of being penalised for simply doing their jobs,"" his spokeswoman said.  Christopher Warren of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents journalists, said the amendments did not give him confidence journalists would not be put at risk.  ""The recommendations do seem to take some steps forward in that they improve parliamentary and governmental oversight of ASIO but they do nothing to improve community or media oversight of these important issues,"" he said.  ""[The new laws] will leave ASIO with substantial powers to intervene in the work of media and of journalists, to persecute and to prosecute whistleblowers and indeed journalists who are dealing with whistleblowers,"" he said.  He added it was the alliance's view that under the new legislation publishing stories like many of the Edward Snowden revelations, including the revelation about the tapping of government phones in Indonesia, ""could well become a criminal offence"" in the future rather than a public interest matter.  One of the amendments government made to 35P was that the Director of Public Prosecution must take into account the public interest, including the public interest in publication, before initiating a prosecution of a whistleblower or journalist for the disclosure of an SIO.  But Greg Barns of the Australian Lawyers Association said this clause was ""bullshit"".  ""The Director of Public Prosecution in every case it prosecutes uses a public interest test,"" he said.  Mr Barns added that the DPP would be under ""considerable pressure"" by government to prosecute anyone who disclosed information.  He said the laws would have ""not just a chilling effect but a freezing effect"" on national security reporting.  Senator Ludlam of the Greens told Fairfax Media his party would be opposing the bill in the Senate and moving significant amendments.  Senator Lazarus, of the Palmer United Party, has also proposed minor amendments.  Senator Ludlam said the premise of the bill was flawed.  ""The special intelligence operations framework ... is effectively unamendable, [as is] the idea that journalists or somebody sharing an item on Facebook could be jailed for ten years for basically disclosing information in the public interest,"" he said.  ""Also [flawed is] the idea that ASIO's definition of a computer network ... could encompass the entire internet.""",""

","This is not a novel suspicion nor an exotic point of view within the actuali computer security community. Nevertheless I wouldnât have said anything, because honestlyâ¦ who cares. Well meaning people keep recommendingii his stuff to me however, which is getting annoying. I would like a ready reference to be able to explain my position with a single link in the future, so here we go.Consider his most recent article, Air Gaps.    Since I started working with Snowdenâs documents, I have been using a number of tools to try to stay secure from the NSA. The advice I shared included using Tor, preferring certain cryptography over others, and using public-domain encryption wherever possible.The recommendation to still use Toriii is already a declaration of affiliation. Which, whateverâ¦ everyoneâs free to choose a camp in this world.In principle preferring certain types of cryptography over others is sound. The problem seems to be that Schneier prefers exactly the wrong types (ECC). I donât know that thereâs anything more suspicious in all crypto currently than ECC, and while suspicion and educated guesswork might not interest you, the fact still remains that ECC is, historically, the most frequently attacked by the NSA. Review the record.Public domain encryption is probably the correct choice, but it should not be in any case regarded as ironclad. The âmillion eyesâ theory is mostly a mythiv, as well exemplified by the Bitcoin codebase. While perfectly open, and while offering clever folks a great financial incentive to find flaws, nevertheless it was two years before anyone read or comprehended the database code it was relying on to a degree sufficient to understand how it was being initialised. And it took a massive fork that nearly killed the project back in March to get people even looking at that part of the code. Thus your notion that public domain software has been already reviewed by countless experts at no cost or expense to you may well be misplaced.    I also recommended using an air gap, which physically isolates a computer or local network of computers from the Internet. (The name comes from the literal gap of air between the computer and the Internet; the word predates wireless networks.)This is a great recommendation. Air gaps are an essential building block of COMSEC, or at least of COMSEC that works at any rate.    Air gaps might be conceptually simple, but theyâre hard to maintain in practice. The truth is that nobody wants a computer that never receives files from the Internet and never sends files out into the Internet. What they want is a computer thatâs not directly connected to the Internet, albeit with some secure way of moving files on and off.This is also largely correct, minus the insistence on âfilesâ. You can have perfectly functional airgaps through the use of a QR reader gun on each end. I know at least some MPEx users employ this method to pass signed orders to their live connection and receipt responses back to their airgapped machine. Itâs a really neat solution that however involves no files - and in fact I would hold that filelessness as a strong point of the entire system - darned hard to hack a QR gun via a QR code.The intervening considerations are also correct, sure, Obama Osama used one, all that jazz.    And air gaps have been breached. Stuxnet was a US and Israeli military-grade piece of malware that attacked the Natanz nuclear plant in Iran. It successfully jumped the air gap and penetrated the Natanz network. Another piece of malware named agent.btz, probably Chinese in origin, successfully jumped the air gap protecting US military networks.This, to the best of my knowledge, is factually incorrect. While itâs possible Schneier knows something I donât, as far as I know Stuxnet did not cross any airgap. It was carelessly spread by poor security procedures. I suppose you can take the hardline that âif thereâs an airgap at any place in the design and stuff nevertheless gets across you may claim the airgap was breached, even if it was in fact the techs bypassing the airgapâ. This argument is perfectly solid in some contexts, such as in the post-mortem analysis of the defeated system. This argument is utterly facetious in a general discussion of airgaps, about akin to saying that âpasswords offer no security because in at least one case an employee kept a post-it with his passwords on his monitor and so the workstation was trivially subvertedâ. Obviously that subversion didnât involve password security, it was a social engineering attack through and throughv.Agent.btz on the other hand definitely did not cross any airgaps, it simply benefited from the atrociously careless and irresponsible behaviours of contemporary US SIGINT people.viBack to reality : breaching an airgap is insanely difficult, and - much like RSA factorisation - an unsolved problem.    Since working with Snowdenâs NSA files, I have tried to maintain a single air-gapped computer. It turned out to be harder than I expected, and I have ten rules for anyone trying to do the same:    1. When you set up your computer, connect it to the Internet as little as possible.No. To quote myself,    Any piece of hardware that was ever at any point in its life connected to the Internet can no longer be used as part of an airgapped system. Period.And since weâre on the topic, any girl that has been having as little sex as possible while taking great care for every round to last less than thirty seconds still isnât a virgin. Not no more. Funny how that works, and weird that I should have to point this out.    Itâs impossible to completely avoid connecting the computer to the InternetThis is, of course, false. Completely, patently, outrageously and mindnumbingly false.For one, there existed computers before there was an Internet. They worked just fine - heck, in many cases they worked a lot better than the current Windows / Cloud crapola.    I purchased my computer off-the-shelf in a big box storeThis is a good idea.    then went to a friendâs network and downloaded everything I needed in a single sessionThis is a horribly bad, retarded idea. For one, the âfriendâ belies gross unfamiliarity with the principled core of COMSEC. That is to say, if you use a third party, itâs either an unrelated third party or else itâs related for a very good reason thatâs part of the objectives. Thus, using your own computer, or using a random wireless connection are the available options. Using the customerâs connection, if youâre working for one and they want you to may also be fine. Using âa friendâ, ie a related entity thatâs related in a way thatâs not related to your project nor justified by it is exactly, but I say exactly the hole through which the night comes in. Just go wan raiding already.For the other, you really donât need to download anything on your airgapped computer. You can always download your favourite Linux CD distro, checksum it, burn it and live a happy life subsequently. And if even for a moment you believe yourself involved in COMSEC off Windows computers you really have to re-read footnote #5 above.    The ultra-paranoid way to do this is to buy two identical computers, configure one using the above method, upload the results to a cloud-based anti-virus checker, and transfer the results of that to the air gap machine using a one-way process.This is so stupid a plan it beggars belief. For one, anything to do with âcloud-basedâ is about as antithetical to what weâre doing here Iâm beginning to suspect a certain three letter agency has a deal with the various cloud operators to somehow diddle everything on the go. Thereâs just no way to explain why anyone would be proposing this cargo cult voodoo otherwise. Be that as it may, do not, under any circumstances and for any reason involve âthe cloudâ in your airgapping efforts. It does not belong there.And for that matter, antiviruses are a myth. They roughly work in the same manner US budget ceilings work, their only security implication being that if youâre in a space that uses antiviruses you know youâre in a space thatâs never going to be secure.    2. Install the minimum software set you need to do your job, and disable all operating system services that you wonât need. The less software you install, the less an attacker has available to exploit.This is good advice.    I downloaded and installed OpenOffice, a PDF reader, a text editor, TrueCrypt, and BleachBit.This is patent nonsense, antithetical to the aformentioned good advice. For one, OpenOffice is a dead project, and has been for a long long time. This means theyâre no longer keeping up with the world. For the other, a PDF reader is in no conceivable way needed on an airgapped machine, ever. Also, the PDF format is so fucking dangerous that it, together with Windows style WYSIWYG editors and their braindamaged attempts to become emacs through misimplementing macros etc create most of the ownage cases that donât involve a browser. Get rid of them, you donât need bulleted lists and power point presentations on your airgapped machine. Airgap it from stupid too, since youâre going to all this trouble.    (No, I donât have any inside knowledge about TrueCrypt, and thereâs a lot about it that makes me suspicious. But for Windows full-disk encryption itâs that, Microsoftâs BitLocker, or Symantecâs PGPDisk â and I am more worried about large US corporations being pressured by the NSA than I am about TrueCrypt.)Windows full disk encryption does not work. At all. Itâs pure snake oil.Linux full disk encryption does not really work, for that matter. If the sorts of problems that full disk encryption is intended to resolve actually are security considerations for you, the correct approach is something akin to keeping a half gallon bottle of oil of vitriol close by at all times and the hard drive exposed and within reach, because no âfull disk encryptionâ will keep your data safe from an attacker with physical access to your full disk and enough time and gadgetryvii on their hands.The correct solution for the vast majority of applications is, of course, to simply gpg whatever you want to keep secret and forget about it. A properly made passphrase will keep your attacker sucking air out of a can indefinitely.    3. Once you have your computer configured, never directly connect it to the Internet again. Consider physically disabling the wireless capability, so it doesnât get turned on by accident.For that matter, consider driving a nail through the wireless controller.    If you need to install new softwareYou donât. Ever. An airgapped system may never be upgraded no matter what happens, come hell or high water. Itâs salted and brined as is.If you absolutely must have some spanking new feature, youâre making a new airgapped machine. If making a new airgapped machine isnât worth the hassle you donât need whatever feature.    Turn off all autorun features. This should be standard practice for all the computers you own, but itâs especially important for an air-gapped computer. Agent.btz used autorun to infect US military computers.Right. So much derp & lol in here I donât even.    Minimize the amount of executable code you move onto the air-gapped computer. Text files are best. Microsoft Office files and PDFs are more dangerous, since they might have embedded macros. Turn off all macro capabilities you can on the air-gapped computer. Donât worry too much about patching your system; in general, the risk of the executable code is worse than the risk of not having your patches up to date. Youâre not on the Internet, after all.Just get rid of the damned Microsoft stuff, and of the damned âofficeâ crap.    Only use trusted media to move files on and off air-gapped computers. A USB stick you purchase from a store is safer than one given to you by someone you donât know â or one you find in a parking lot.This is true, if the file obsession a little out of place. Seriously, the world is not made out of files, the world is made out of data streams.    For file transfer, a writable optical disk (CD or DVD) is safer than a USB stick. Malware can silently write data to a USB stick, but it canât spin the CD-R up to 1000 rpm without your noticing. This means that the malware can only write to the disk when you write to the disk. You can also verify how much data has been written to the CD by physically checking the back of it. If youâve only written one file, but it looks like three-quarters of the CD was burned, you have a problem. Note: the first company to market a USB stick with a light that indicates a write operation â not read or write; Iâve got one of those â wins a prize.This is pure voodoo, seriously. So it can only write when you write, what sort of defense is that ? You will write, wonât you ? Youâve written âone fileâ and 3/4 of the CD appears burned to visual inspection ? Whatâs this, an application of the â64kb files should be enough for everyoneâ principle in tandem with the âHoly Mary Full of Graceâ approach to security/birth control ?Visual inspection of a CD is about as likely to catch that three and a half kb piece of malware as TSA screening is to catch terrorists. Forget about nonsense ritual and do things that have an impact on actual security rather than your subjective impression of security. Stroking that later is how the former gets compromised. Fucking CD auguration, I can not believe this.What if the CD is sorta greenish ? Is that bad ? Cause you know, green is for poison, maybe we should only use blue tinted CDs. Those are cool, right ?    When moving files on and off your air-gapped computer, use the absolute smallest storage device you can. And fill up the entire device with random files. If an air-gapped computer is compromised, the malware is going to try to sneak data off it using that media. While malware can easily hide stolen files from you, it canât break the laws of physics. Nor can it rewrite anything. It is a point of fact that no malware ever rewrites anything. Like, ever. At all. It just starts new processes and creates new âfilesâ for everything. Always. Itâs in the rules, when Schneierâs God created Schneierâs Enchanted Universe of Strangely Insecure Computer Security, he made this a rule of Schphysics.    Consider encrypting everything you move on and off the air-gapped computer. Sometimes youâll be moving public files and it wonât matter, but sometimes you wonât be, and it will. And if youâre using optical media, those disks will be impossible to erase. Strong encryption solves these problems. And donât forget to encrypt the computer as well; whole-disk encryption is the best.Whole disk encryption is retarded in all those implementations which require the system to have the keys in order to use that disk. Strong encryption of individual files is always a good idea. That strong encryption means one thing and one thing only : gpg --encrypt --armor -r yourkey    One thing I didnât do, although itâs worth considering, is use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD â you can keep your data on an encrypted USB stick â is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof, but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack.I have no idea about Tails. Maybe. Itâs in general a bad idea to make exotic systems your team doesnât understand well central to your security. Debian Sarge is, for this reason, a much better choice than whatever tails.    Yes, all this is advice for the paranoidSadly, a large chunk of it is advice for the delusional. They do go together, delusional and paranoid, but not to any sort of useful effect.    And itâs probably impossible to enforce for any network more complicated than a single computer with a single user. But if youâre thinking about setting up an air-gapped computer, you already believe that some very powerful attackers are after you personally. If youâre going to use an air gap, use it properly.Security is never âprobably impossibleâ. Anything you wish to do is quite possible, just as long as you donât expect Windows, whole disk encryption and the cloud to do it for you. That aside, yes, if youâre going to the trouble of doing anything, anything whatsoever, do it properly. That includes not relying on Windows etc.    Of course you can take things further. I have met people who have physically removed the camera, microphone, and wireless capability altogether. But thatâs too much paranoia for me right now.Iâve not met any people who havenât. If you use a laptop for the purpose of being your cold computer, you definitely want to rape the cam and the mic (some models come with a 2nd mic hidden in the chassis btw). And drive a nail through the fucking wireless controller.In closing, I would like to stress that none of this negates Schneierâs past accomplishments or achievements. Applied Cryptography is still a great book. Itâs just that I donât trust him, not anymore."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","jpinkman","493","2013-10-13T08:00:12","Article: Why I suspect Schneier is an US agent.","Discussion/Security"," Sure. I understand that. I just don't agree with the author you quoted, who appears to be nitpicking part of his procedural instructions on the use of Air Gaps.  For instance, I understand the rationale of going to a friend's home and doing the download session. Schneier is a high profile infosec expert who could be High Value Target for compromise. Some random friend of his who works in an entirely different field (but that Schneier has advised on how to keep his machine secure) is not. I think the author either missed that point or grossly minimized it. The author recommends using a random wireless connection and even an off the cuff remark about going ""WAN raiding"". Whatever. Using a random wireless hotspot as a step up security wise sounds moronic, as now you have to worry about the intentions of a person you don't know allowing you to use their wireless connection for free. He doesn't have to worry about MITM or whatever else from his friend. And WAN raiding? Seriously? This is an article written for the mass audience so it couldn't have been a serious suggestion.  There are a number of things that he doesn't seem to get right. For instance he rails on Schneier for using Openoffice because it's no longer being developed. This is not true as a point of fact. It's known as ""Apache Openoffice"" now, yes it's still open source, yes it's still being developed, and its latest 4.01 was released not long ago.   His biggest beef seems to be that Schneier is even making suggestions about securing Windows without bothering to consider the target audience being written for. Well ... uh ... yeah he could have made it exclusively about linux and swearing off windows, but how is that going to help those that don't have the inclination to switch?   Schneier did not write that article for people in his own field, who we would have to assume would be familiar with best practices in their everyday work. It was written for the layman.  He's always been an outspoken activist and he sits on the board at EFF. Sure, you never say never. Healthy skepticism is always good and if James Jesus Angleton had some about Kim Philby he might not have gone insane. But IMO Schneier strikes me as the furthest from an agent there is if you were going to suspect anyone in his field of being one. ","Really, though we should trust zero people. Questioning Schneier should be par for the course regardless of his accomplishments. Just like we should question anyone. There should be no free passes. "

Schneier's expertise in security centers on cryptography. Whiteboxing and netsec is definitely NOT his raison d'etre. This is obvious by the stunning fact that he still uses windows as his main machine and his own admission that he 'doesn't compile'. People like that blog author assume because of his high profile that he knows it all, and is an expert in all areas of infosec. I guess it's a sign of respect his rep generates that the author would accuse him of being a government shill before considering that he might not be at the forefront of data security. Yet if you read blog with regularity it becomes glaringly obvious.   ^^This. Completely agree. He's got a knack for explaining complex security concepts and crypto to the mass consumer, is a talented narrator, and IMO an excellent all around choice by Guardian as the resident expert they sorely needed to help interpret the Snowden docs and provide color commentary. He's relatable to the average reader and an expert in his specialization but is not a guru in all facets of infosec. ","He's an impressive guy, but it's important to remember what he *isn't*.  He's not the cutting edge of modern security technology or anonymity theory.  Fifteen years ago, maybe, but that's just now how he seems to have spent the past fifteen years.  ...<snip>... If he told me that AES was broken, I'd give that a lot of weight.   If he told me that Firefox was more or less secure than Chrome, I'd realize that we'd stepped outside the circle of his core strengths, and I'd be more skeptical.;But he's the perfect person to help reporters deal with Snowden documents, because he does have a fantastic background in crypto and its implications, yet he knows how to help them translate that into concepts that your grandma can understand.  Don't take his specific recommendations as the gospel, but he's the best option we have for technical analysis of Snowden's documents."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","fuckingfedsandnoobsohmy","493","2013-10-16T05:34:23","Article: Why I suspect Schneier is an US agent.","Discussion/Security"," The leaked Snowden documents show that the NSA has trouble with Tor, if we accept the documents as legitimate anyway. I don't think Snowden is in good favor of the US government, but I suppose it is possible he is leaking false information with the support of the US government, in a way that makes it look like the leaks are real. Would be some mighty fine PSYOPS, but it is possible. Most of the leaks are saying things that were already widely thought to be true. Some of them were essentially known to be true, like DUAL_EC_DRGB being no good and probably an NSA backdoor. The only thing really new that I have gotten from the leaks, that I didn't already know or imagine, is that the NSA has trouble directly breaking Tor. I would have actually thought that the NSA can manage to break Tor with relative ease. So it does seem a bit strange. Even the Tor developers are a bit surprised that the NSA seems to be having trouble to break Tor. And of course there is the fact that the lead Tor developer used to work at NSA, and that the original person who designed Tor still works for the US military. It makes for a good conspiracy. Who knows.     This is debatable. For a long time it seems nearly everybody thought ECC was the future. It is true that the NSA has very much pushed people toward ECC, but it has been pushed by many who are not in the NSA as well. The NSA certifies only ECC for Secret and above classified information, but they have a classified suite of algorithm suggestions as well, that are only known to people with Top Secret clearances. I wonder if Snowden will leak NSA Suite A algorithms, that would be interesting. ECC has some major advantages over traditional public key cryptography. It produces much smaller ciphertexts, it is often faster, the keys are much smaller. These things are easily proven. It is, or at least was, widely thought to be significantly more secure as well. I don't know the exact ratio off the top of my head, but a 512 bit ECC key is/was thought to be significantly stronger than a 4,096 bit RSA key. That is a pretty good mix of properties. Smaller in all ways, faster, and stronger.   There are some sketchy things about it though. It hasn't been studied for a great deal of time. The mathematics behind RSA have been studied for thousands of years, people have been interested in prime factorization for a long time and still nobody knows how to do it very fast for very large numbers. The problems related to ECC have been studied for much less time, and it is widely thought that a breakthrough in ECC cryptanalysis is much more likely than a breakthrough in RSA cryptanalysis. But I think most people think that they are both based on hard problems. If we assume that the NSA has broken some type of cryptography in a breakthrough though, it is probably more likely that they have broken ECC than RSA or DH. Or maybe they just have really fast computers and can factor 1,024 bit numbers. In which case switching to ECC would be better, if we assume the strength is much better bit for bit than RSA and DH.   ECC is the edgy and cool closer-to-cutting-edge of cryptography, RSA and DH are the old and out of style conservatives of cryptography.     Sure, and it is possible to have this with air gaps.   This is not an air gap.    That was not an airgap. They allowed USB to be plugged in. That broke the air gap in their threat model. Their air gap wasn't breached, it was poorly implemented.    I disagree with the notion that they used an airgap. Their goal was to prevent malicious attackers from subverting their centrifuges. An airgap would have meant that nothing from the internet could get to their centrifuges. Not having them hooked up to the internet via ethernet doesn't mean there was an air gap. They let outside USB devices be plugged in. It isn't the most common path to a target, but it is an exploitable path (allowing the attacker to defeat the security requirements of their threat model) from the internet to the target, and therefore it is not an air gap.    Sure. Even breaching the not-really-an-airgap of Iran was insanely difficult. Breaching a real airgap is even more difficult! Another example of a breached air gap is the network Bradley Manning got data off prior to leaking it. That network wasn't connected to the general internet, and they thought it was air gapped. But once again, they allowed external media to be exposed to their system, and he was able to pull files off the network and put them on a CD. Snowden likely breached an airgap as well, using USB sticks. An air gap wouldn't have been enough in either of these cases though, since the 'attackers' had legitimate access to the information (or illegitimate access to it, from a legitimate starting point, in the case of Snowden). The military would have been smart to have physical checkpoints as well, making the people with access to these networks be patted down and searched prior to leaving the secured area after having had contact with the air gapped networks (since their primary threat model is preventing information leaks).    It entirely depends on the threat model, but is in general incorrect. If I air gap my GPG private key, it doesn't matter if the system it is on has been connected to the internet in the past. Hell, it could even have a thousand viruses on it. All that matters to meet my security goal (not having my private key stolen), is that the system cannot transmit to the internet after it has my private key on it. If my goal is to prevent someone from erasing my private key, then it makes more sense to say the air gapped system cannot have ever had access to the internet. But it is really close to impossible to have a system that was never connected to the internet, because even the installation CD you use to install the OS will have been connected to the internet at some point.     It was probably connected to the internet at some point, or had something that was connected to the internet installed on it. Even the firmware on the hardware could have been connected to the internet at some point, or from an internal network that had a bridge to the internet.       I don't think it is a really horrible idea, depending on what exactly your threat model is anyway. Dude seems like a bit of an idiot at this point. ","The recommendation to still use Toriii is already a declaration of affiliation. Which, whateverâ¦ everyoneâs free to choose a camp in this world.;In principle preferring certain types of cryptography over others is sound. The problem seems to be that Schneier prefers exactly the wrong types (ECC). I donât know that thereâs anything more suspicious in all crypto currently than ECC, and while suspicion and educated guesswork might not interest you, the fact still remains that ECC is, historically, the most frequently attacked by the NSA. Review the record.;    Air gaps might be conceptually simple, but theyâre hard to maintain in practice. The truth is that nobody wants a computer that never receives files from the Internet and never sends files out into the Internet. What they want is a computer thatâs not directly connected to the Internet, albeit with some secure way of moving files on and off.;This is also largely correct, minus the insistence on âfilesâ. You can have perfectly functional airgaps through the use of a QR reader gun on each end. I know at least some MPEx users employ this method to pass signed orders to their live connection and receipt responses back to their airgapped machine. Itâs a really neat solution that however involves no files - and in fact I would hold that filelessness as a strong point of the entire system - darned hard to hack a QR gun via a QR code.;And air gaps have been breached. Stuxnet was a US and Israeli military-grade piece of malware that attacked the Natanz nuclear plant in Iran. It successfully jumped the air gap and penetrated the Natanz network. Another piece of malware named agent.btz, probably Chinese in origin, successfully jumped the air gap protecting US military networks.;This, to the best of my knowledge, is factually incorrect. While itâs possible Schneier knows something I donât, as far as I know Stuxnet did not cross any airgap. It was carelessly spread by poor security procedures. I suppose you can take the hardline that âif thereâs an airgap at any place in the design and stuff nevertheless gets across you may claim the airgap was breached, even if it was in fact the techs bypassing the airgapâ. This argument is perfectly solid in some contexts, such as in the post-mortem analysis of the defeated system. This argument is utterly facetious in a general discussion of airgaps, about akin to saying that âpasswords offer no security because in at least one case an employee kept a post-it with his passwords on his monitor and so the workstation was trivially subvertedâ. Obviously that subversion didnât involve password security, it was a social engineering attack through and throughv.;Back to reality : breaching an airgap is insanely difficult, and - much like RSA factorisation - an unsolved problem.;No. To quote myself, Any piece of hardware that was ever at any point in its life connected to the Internet can no longer be used as part of an airgapped system. Period.;This is, of course, false. Completely, patently, outrageously and mindnumbingly false.For one, there existed computers before there was an Internet. They worked just fine - heck, in many cases they worked a lot better than the current Windows / Cloud crapola.    I purchased my computer off-the-shelf in a big box storeThis is a good idea.;then went to a friendâs network and downloaded everything I needed in a single sessionThis is a horribly bad, retarded idea. For one, the âfriendâ belies gross unfamiliarity with the principled core of COMSEC. That is to say, if you use a third party, itâs either an unrelated third party or else itâs related for a very good reason thatâs part of the objectives. Thus, using your own computer, or using a random wireless connection are the available options. Using the customerâs connection, if youâre working for one and they want you to may also be fine. Using âa friendâ, ie a related entity thatâs related in a way thatâs not related to your project nor justified by it is exactly, but I say exactly the hole through which the night comes in. Just go wan raiding already."

His SHA-3 candidate is the only submission that should be trusted, as Keccak was ALTERED recently and quietly by NIST after the competition, so it's no longer the exact same algorithm that was submitted and vetted. It's now SHA-3.1 which nobody should trust.  Alright let's debunk Mircea Popescu who is a known troll, though while hilarious at times is handing out bad advice too. He is screwed if the FBI finds out Ross Ulbricht used Mpex for laundering coins around too. Romania allows extradition.   Schneier absolutely does not prefer this, after reading NSA capabilities he warned everybody to use symmetric encryption and stay away from ECC because it uses math factoring tricks to remain secure like all other public key crypto does.   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance From that article: ""Prefer symmetric cryptography over public-key cryptography. Prefer conventional discrete-log-based systems over elliptic-curve systems; the latter have constants that the NSA influences when they can""  True, a lot of open source crypto is usually shit. Look up cryptocat.  True you can, not if your adversary is a nation state that can sit in the next room and read the electromagnetic radiation emitting from the reader. This is why they aren't used in hospitals, if he read ""Bar scanning in a patient environment"" security paper he would know this. You can only do this if you set up a Standard Integrated Command Post Shelter tent to prevent next door neighbor analysis (SCIF tent). All NATO politicians use these tents for communications security in hotel rooms.  Why would you attack the gun? Generate a code that attacks the host air gap machine. We also would know nothing about the gun, it would be a closed source blackbox filled with tightly sealed patents. Who's to say you can't modify it. Considering you can record sounds in a room from 10 miles away with a laser http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_microphone I would be worried about anything relying on light to transfer information unless it was inside a windowless SICP tent.  Kaspersky after analyzing Stuxnet and FLAME claimed they were specifically designed for air gap infiltration. He also claimed CIA had been known to drop USB sticks infected with malware in parking lots and inside buildings so that anybody picking it up would hopefully plug it into an air gapped machine or internal network to find out what it was.    When they manufacturer equipment it's often done in a networked environment.. connected to the internet. They also will  test boxes before shipping. Some manufacturers even connect the device to outside servers to update the software. If you build your own FPGA then sure. The hardware itself also may be backdoored such as Lenovo devices the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China is accused of backdooring: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/29/lenovo_accused_backdoors_intel_ban/  You also have to add applications to a standard linux install. The only way to do that is download them on a different computer and then transfer to the air gap. So in effect, you are still connected to the internet just manually moving internet downloaded packages.    Except, none of the distros are using gitian or another method for deterministic building like bitcoin.org and torproject.org are doing. Debian is sort of using it, but not fully yet. You could be downloading fully backdoored toolchains and compilers and never know. Popescu also doesn't address failures in the random number generator of Linux.  https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details  True, change the virus signature in a VM and try it out on any anti-virus program, it will most likely work.  The Snowden docs are all PDFs. This is why Bruce needed one. Sure he could have converted it to some other open format but why bother, he's just reading docs and doesn't want them easily stolen by the NSA because they still don't fully know what Snowden took.    Bullshit. FDE works, so long as you use vetted, open source crypto. Truecrypt is getting a full analysis right now from Matthew Green and some other PHDs.What it doesn't protect against is rubber hose analysis, or failures in OpSec to secure your system against a physical adversary who can sneak and peak. https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/12/full-disk_encry.html and I just came back from a local police security conference where they lamented on the spread of full disc encryption hampering investigations.    Great idea, I'll just look at your snapshots and memory dumps to get your key because you haven't used full disc encryption to protect against forensic hard drive analysis.  Or I will simply cat your bash history and find the password you used on the command line lol. Again, does not at all acknowledge the wide open failures in linux random number generators that have been recently found.   Except they just released a new version of GPG to fix some critical errors, and they will no doubt be fixing /dev/random soon. If you don't upgrade you are using crippled crypto with known vuln. Great advice.    If autorun (auto mount)  is enabled in any linux or windows machine, your malware can impersonate itself as a USB drive easily. There's probably a dozen Defcon presentations where they made linux malware that pretended to be a USB drive, complete with it's own firmware that interacted with the kernel. Easy backdoor.    True but he misses Schneiers point that you will notice the CD being loaded up and running when you haven't started it. He also misses the point of it being read only, whereas a USB is full of firmware (see above Defcon backdoors) and can be rewritten silently.    True, it could rewrite the junk but hopefully you would do analysis on the other side and notice this. ""Hey, instead of a bunch of Zero's there's now a binary in there full of my documents!"". It's just an extra security.    lol. Every cryptographer on earth says it's a bad idea to rely on single file encryption yet Popescu claims otherwise. You should use both, one to protect analysis of dumped memory and snapshots/logs, protect against any faults found in GnuPG for which there may be some we don't know about yet. Then gpg --encrypt and protect your files. PGP offers no forward secrecy, so your stuff is forever out there to be decrypted one day through an OpSec slip or arrest. Any bug found in GnuPG means you're fucked if your stuff has been archived by agents. Your full disc encryption is effectively a gigantic padding to prevent cryptanalysis on the GnuPG protected files and emails which may have bugs we don't know about. They (GnuPG team) literally just fixed a vulnerability a few weeks ago that allowed your private keys to be uploaded to a key server for retrieval.   Tails is Debian. lol   This is the difference between a cryptographer who is constantly finding holes in even decades old vetted crypto, and an asshat who thinks Linux is magic. Securing an entire network from state adversaries is impossible. This is why the NSA  keep non networked air gapped machines for the ""crown jewels"" and why China is consistently breaking into other state's private networks regardless of the PHD cryptographers, hackers and security engineers they throw billions at to prevent it.  I like Popescu but damnit, stick to trolling Gox and ycombinator startups. You are making yourself look retarded when you venture into crypto engineering claiming security is 'easy' for defense against intel agencies with 500 billion per year in funding.

Just wanted to see what people had to say about that other commentary.   Really, though we should trust zero people. Questioning Schneier should be par for the course regardless of his accomplishments. Just like we should question anyone. There should be no free passes.   ","Dude whatEVER. Schneier is NOT an agent. He's a good guy, perhaps the most prolific good guy around.As far as ECC, he's already repudiated his earlier recommendation. After trawling through the Snowden docs he's convinced the NSA has manipulated the constants. Keep in mind the audience that he's writing for in the Guardian ... the mainstream masses that don't run linux and just want to implement some sound security practices without there being a high learning or labor curve involved. Air Gaps by and large are going to be very secure for such an audience."

In the middle of the 90's cryptowars, his Applied Cryptography book was the first to make crypto approachable.  It provided a fairly comprehensive explanation, with source code, of cryptography, at a time when there just weren't other resources available.  He revised the book once, a long time ago, and it's still in print.    Tellingly, the version still in print is considered fairly dated by people actually implementing crypto.. just blindly using his source code 10+ years later is no longer the right way to do things, and I know software assurance folks who think that right now, his Applied Cryptography book is actually somewhat dangerous, as people blindly follow it as the bible, and problems ensue.  Not to say that it's not still a great way to learn crypto, but that his reference implementations are no longer references and don't reflect modern day attacks.  The concepts are good, but the source code should not be cut and pasted and relied on.  It's too old.  He's an impressive guy, but it's important to remember what he *isn't*.  He's not the cutting edge of modern security technology or anonymity theory.  Fifteen years ago, maybe, but that's just now how he seems to have spent the past fifteen years.   His more recent books have been more approachable, very high level, and aimed at the theories around risk.  He's been one of the largest critics of the TSA, and has probably pointed out more ""security as theater"" worthless, dramatic security measures since 9/11 than any other author I know of.  But when it comes to specific, technical recommendations that are not specifically about cryptography, I take him with a large grain of salt.  He's just not at the forefront of that line of thinking.. it's not what he's been doing, and it's not his strength.   But he's the perfect person to help reporters deal with Snowden documents, because he does have a fantastic background in crypto and its implications, yet he knows how to help them translate that into concepts that your grandma can understand.   If he told me that AES was broken, I'd give that a lot of weight.   If he told me that Firefox was more or less secure than Chrome, I'd realize that we'd stepped outside the circle of his core strengths, and I'd be more skeptical.  Is he a government shill?   If so, then we are in much worse shape than we all realize.  Because Schneier has consistently been saying ""We're fucked, the government is out of control"" since many people here were in diapers, so if that's the toned down version, what would the reality have to be like for THAT to be the message they're paying him to spread?  Don't take his specific recommendations as the gospel, but he's the best option we have for technical analysis of Snowden's documents. ",""

So was the checksum!    And here he has revealed the fact that he is not as skilled as he would like you to think he is. Does he really think a Stuxnet level targeted attack is going to be detected by a cloud based anti-virus checker? It is possible, but not very likely at all. I think Stuxnet had infected hundreds of thousands of computers before it was finally detected. Also, depending on your threat model, you might not even care if you air gapped system has viruses on it, as long as they cannot phone home.     Oh, I guess it was Bruce who said that. Yeah Bruce, that was pretty fucking retarded. I guess I have to agree with this guy here. Doesn't sound like advice from a security expert to say the least.   Essentially.   Other than the fact that an attacker shouldn't be able to exploit anything if your system is really actually air gapped.   You can use a PDF reader on an airgapped machine, depending on your threat model. If my goal is to read documents without anybody knowing what I am reading, maybe the person I get the documents from sends them to me encrypted. Then I burn the ciphertexts to disposable CD's, and transfer them to my air gapped machine. Then I decrypt them, and read them with my PDF viewer. No need to worry about hackers spying on what I read, because even if my machine is infected the virus cannot phone home. It is still imo an air gap because even though it is exposed to USB sticks that were exposed to the internet, my threat model allows for that. I am not exposing my uranium enriching centrifuges to the USB stick that was exposed to the internet, and my goal is not to prevent an attacker from wiping my drive or corrupting my hardware, my goal is to prevent the attacker from seeing the content of the documents I am reading.    This is more or less true. The military uses Secure Compartmentalized Information Facilities, and shit loads of soldiers with big guns. You don't have those protecting your drive from the feds. FDE can help, but it isn't going to help from a competent well funded and intelligent attacker, unless they make a mistake.    Uhm no, pretty much at this point (the attacker knows you and can gain physical access) GPG and FDE are equal. In fact, they are extremely close to the same thing at this point in time, since AES-256 with a password and PBKDF is going to be the same thing protecting your drive and your private key.   Indeed.   Depends on the threat model. You can upgrade in some cases. He seems to be confusing two very different goals of airgaps. One goal is to keep attackers out (Iran with their centrifuges), another goal is to keep information in (me with my private GPG keys, the military with their various networks that keep getting pwnt by leakers). If your goal is to keep attackers out, you would never want to upgrade the system, because it would break the airgap in this case. If your goal is to keep information in, you can upgrade the system as long as you follow proper procedure. I could download a new version of GPG and burn it to a CD, then load it to the air gapped system and fry the CD (since it was exposed to the system that was air gapped, I would assume that the CD had covertly had malware placed on it that burned my secret key to part of the free space on the CD and would transmit it back if it ever touched the internet again).  This of it like this. I want to use GPG fully air gapped. I have two goals, one I want to be able to decrypt messages sent to me and two I want to be able to send messages to others. I would do it as follows:  Private Key is on one system with no access to the internet, but it does have a CD drive (though nothing else). When I get ciphertexts, I burn them to CD and then load them in my Private Key Computer. I then microwave the CD, since I can never expose it to the internet again. Now I can decrypt my message with my private key and read the plaintext. Hackers could theoretically compromise me via the CD, via the ciphertexts I decrypt, etc....but I don't really care because they cannot phone home my private key even if they totally root the system.   I still need to be able to send messages to my contacts though. My messaging writing system has no access to the internet, but it does have a CD drive (though nothing else). When I want to send messages to people, I need to encrypt the messages to their public keys. This is a tricky situation, because to get the public key I need to load it to the system. It is likely theoretically possible to hack someone by sending them a specially formed malicious GPG key (code execution attacks have been done via ciphertexts and signatures). My main concern is that a hacker could spy on my plaintexts prior to encryption and phone them home. I can burn my contacts public keys to CD's and transfer them to my message writing system, then microwave the CD's. Now I can type messages to my contacts and encrypt them to their public keys. However, at this point there is a risk of breaching the airgap, because if I send the resulting ciphertexts out there is the possibility that they could have secret information somehow embedded in them from malware that infected my machine when I loaded a malicious key. Maybe slowly each message I send leaks some part of every plaintext I have written, and I am oblivious to the fact. Hard problem, I just tried to think of a solution and came up with something very complex but it still breached the airgap in a minor way.   Generally anything exposed to the protected system needs to be destroyed. For example, you can transfer ciphertext from the internet to the airgapped machine on a one time use CD, but you cannot let the CD be exposed to the internet again after this. Using a USB stick isn't really very effective at this, unless you want to throw them out and use a new one each time. Exposing media to the internet, the airgapped machine and then the internet again always breaks the airgap.   [qupte] For file transfer, a writable optical disk (CD or DVD) is safer than a USB stick. Malware can silently write data to a USB stick, but it canât spin the CD-R up to 1000 rpm without your noticing. This means that the malware can only write to the disk when you write to the disk. You can also verify how much data has been written to the CD by physically checking the back of it. If youâve only written one file, but it looks like three-quarters of the CD was burned, you have a problem. Note: the first company to market a USB stick with a light that indicates a write operation â not read or write; Iâve got one of those â wins a prize. [/quote]  You need to use fresh media at all times, you can't trust an exposed USB stick or a CD.   Yeah that seems ritualistic to me.    FDE isn't a bad idea in this case, but it isn't what you should count on to save the day. It really never is.    Tails is a securer hardeneder flavor of Debian, lol.    Gotta agree with him here.   Honestly a lot of what Schneier said in what I have read sounds like something I would expect to read on a noob forum where they think they are secure with ccleaner. I found a lot of it to be surprising, coming from someone who is suppoused to be a world security expert. I could have given better advice than he did. I started out thinking the person who critiqued him was probably a dumbshit, and in some areas I think his points are worth consideration but possibly off the mark (in the case of ECC for example), but I have to admit I am a bit surprised to see some of the things Schneier said. Cloud antivirus? Is he worried about Big Brother or his little brother spying on him!? ","For the other, you really donât need to download anything on your airgapped computer. You can always download your favourite Linux CD distro, checksum it, burn it and live a happy life subsequently. And if even for a moment you believe yourself involved in COMSEC off Windows computers you really have to re-read footnote #5 above.;The ultra-paranoid way to do this is to buy two identical computers, configure one using the above method, upload the results to a cloud-based anti-virus checker, and transfer the results of that to the air gap machine using a one-way process.;This is so stupid a plan it beggars belief. For one, anything to do with âcloud-basedâ is about as antithetical to what weâre doing here Iâm beginning to suspect a certain three letter agency has a deal with the various cloud operators to somehow diddle everything on the go. Thereâs just no way to explain why anyone would be proposing this cargo cult voodoo otherwise. Be that as it may, do not, under any circumstances and for any reason involve âthe cloudâ in your airgapping efforts. It does not belong there.;And for that matter, antiviruses are a myth. They roughly work in the same manner US budget ceilings work, their only security implication being that if youâre in a space that uses antiviruses you know youâre in a space thatâs never going to be secure.;    2. Install the minimum software set you need to do your job, and disable all operating system services that you wonât need. The less software you install, the less an attacker has available to exploit.This is good advice.;This is patent nonsense, antithetical to the aformentioned good advice. For one, OpenOffice is a dead project, and has been for a long long time. This means theyâre no longer keeping up with the world. For the other, a PDF reader is in no conceivable way needed on an airgapped machine, ever. Also, the PDF format is so fucking dangerous that it, together with Windows style WYSIWYG editors and their braindamaged attempts to become emacs through misimplementing macros etc create most of the ownage cases that donât involve a browser. Get rid of them, you donât need bulleted lists and power point presentations on your airgapped machine. Airgap it from stupid too, since youâre going to all this trouble.;Linux full disk encryption does not really work, for that matter. If the sorts of problems that full disk encryption is intended to resolve actually are security considerations for you, the correct approach is something akin to keeping a half gallon bottle of oil of vitriol close by at all times and the hard drive exposed and within reach, because no âfull disk encryptionâ will keep your data safe from an attacker with physical access to your full disk and enough time and gadgetryvii on their hands.;The correct solution for the vast majority of applications is, of course, to simply gpg whatever you want to keep secret and forget about it. A properly made passphrase will keep your attacker sucking air out of a can indefinitely.;3. Once you have your computer configured, never directly connect it to the Internet again. Consider physically disabling the wireless capability, so it doesnât get turned on by accident.For that matter, consider driving a nail through the wireless controller.;If you need to install new softwareYou donât. Ever. An airgapped system may never be upgraded no matter what happens, come hell or high water. Itâs salted and brined as is.;Only use trusted media to move files on and off air-gapped computers. A USB stick you purchase from a store is safer than one given to you by someone you donât know â or one you find in a parking lot.This is true, if the file obsession a little out of place. Seriously, the world is not made out of files, the world is made out of data streams.;Visual inspection of a CD is about as likely to catch that three and a half kb piece of malware as TSA screening is to catch terrorists. Forget about nonsense ritual and do things that have an impact on actual security rather than your subjective impression of security. Stroking that later is how the former gets compromised. Fucking CD auguration, I can not believe this.;Consider encrypting everything you move on and off the air-gapped computer. Sometimes youâll be moving public files and it wonât matter, but sometimes you wonât be, and it will. And if youâre using optical media, those disks will be impossible to erase. Strong encryption solves these problems. And donât forget to encrypt the computer as well; whole-disk encryption is the best.Whole disk encryption is retarded in all those implementations which require the system to have the keys in order to use that disk. Strong encryption of individual files is always a good idea. That strong encryption means one thing and one thing only : gpg --encrypt --armor -r yourkey;    One thing I didnât do, although itâs worth considering, is use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD â you can keep your data on an encrypted USB stick â is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof, but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack.I have no idea about Tails. Maybe. Itâs in general a bad idea to make exotic systems your team doesnât understand well central to your security. Debian Sarge is, for this reason, a much better choice than whatever tails.;    Of course you can take things further. I have met people who have physically removed the camera, microphone, and wireless capability altogether. But thatâs too much paranoia for me right now.Iâve not met any people who havenât. If you use a laptop for the purpose of being your cold computer, you definitely want to rape the cam and the mic (some models come with a 2nd mic hidden in the chassis btw). And drive a nail through the fucking wireless controller.;In closing, I would like to stress that none of this negates Schneierâs past accomplishments or achievements. Applied Cryptography is still a great book. Itâs just that I donât trust him, not anymore."

Moreover, at that time support for longer key lengths raised the serious risk of overloading relay CPUs. In fact, we still face the CPU overload issues with 1024 bit RSA keys today, and this actually introduces its own security risks (due to DoS attacks, circuit failure attacks, and related route capture issues).The good news is we are in the process of upgrading Tor's protocols to support faster, stronger ECC keys, as well as making it easier to change key length and algorithms in the future should the NSA prove to be lying about ECC, too."

Yes giving them a fuck you look would be counterproductive. This is actually pretty important so I guess I should have said slightly irritated. The important thing is your attitude is  your a law abiding citizen who has nothing to worry about but yes not an obnoxious one. The looking strait ahead with a dumb look approach seems suspicious to me. Of course let me say I was also in a dress shirt looking like a professional and if I was trying to look like a dumbass with a baseball cap and a t-shirt aka local then the dumb look approach might be best lol.   BTW don't pull off in rest areas! I've heard from many that they are a favorite haunt of drug task forces everywhere. Pay a few bucks and go to a cheap indian owned motel. The big chains cooperate with DHS and locals and tell on cash payers.   For short rides with small items I always liked the I'm doing my laundry method. You have laundry baskets with dirty laundry and a box of laundry detergent. You hide your shit in the bottom of the detergent box but rap it up good or it will end up smelling like detergent lol.   Yes and car selection is important. Very true that little cars are less suspicious but it's also kind of hard to squeeze a box in a ford focus lol. I was reading about a national survey that said Buick LaCrosses get pulled over less than all other car per capita. But then again they are looking for cars with big trunks. It also depends where you are. In San Francisco get a prius and in Texas get a one ton dually.   Now 5 MPH over is wack! Thats to fast and theres lots of ticket writers that will pull you over for that without hesitation! If its 65 set the cruze on 67 and concentrate on the road and the speed limit signs.   ","This is a very serious thread. Sound advice: If you are watching them watch you, ie you see them as they come up behind you, MAKE SURE! you DO NOT! immediately signal over and change lanes to the right lane if you are in the fast lane as they come up. They will spot you attempting to hide on the right side of the road and notice it. Wait till they come right up on you or a bit before and casually put ur blinker on and move over calmly. And I don't actually support the looking over irritated deal. I prefer the I am totally clueless and staring straight ahead with a dumb look approach. Looking over got someone I know popped. They will drive by and look at you hard. ALSO: rental cars are a bust. Scrape the labels off with a razor blade before travel. Smaller cars hold less baggage and I believe are safer. Geeky cars like a vw bug (new) and such are good covers IMO as well.IF YOU DO GET PULLED OVER. and they decide to get you out of the car to search, AND you DO consent, first you should have held your ground and not given consent, but us enslaved tend to want to comply to seem law abiding. So if you do get out of your car, keep as much shit on your body as possible that you can. They often will only search your car and not you. Make sure you do not let them touch you. I got rolled up and put my hands up in protest to make sure they didn't just put their hands on me. They tapped my front pockets quick and proceeded to the car and NEVER TOUCHED ME AGAIN even after taking all my money, searching my car with a dog and let me go with a ticket. Had my cash been in my back pocket I wouldn't have had to pay back thousands of dollars to my investor. Getting in your car, and touching your person is a very very different thing! They will usually just try and pat your pockets to make sure you don't have any guns. But if you have a wad of cash you'll do better with it on you rather than in the car and then have to explain where it's from. Any different views on this would be appreciated. Also a lock box or safe while suspicious, makes it impossible for them to see what the fuck you have. I support that in lieu of just having shit available to confiscate. At worst they confiscate your lock box and you get it back after you go through the system with a lawyer. Staples has various boxes, safes, and brief cases that lock with keys and combinations. If asked why you have a lock box, I'd probably say so criminals don't steal my personal and private stuff! They will also often get another officer to roll up like he doesn't know anything while they search you so you can talk to him and think you have a friend who's on your side. WARNING: the officer who acts like your friend will become a witness in your trial if you were to have one!!!!!Go about 5 miles above the speed limit at all times, have a radar detector but keep it off your windshield. They are looking for the money more than the drugs. NEVER be honest thinking you'll get on their good side. NEVER throw your drugs out the vehicle if they say you might as well since the K9 is coming. Never believe a word they say."

I'm never too high or drunk (I have broken that a time or 2 and been pulled over but meh) and I'm usually nervous to a degree but that's not unusual when getting pulled over.   I'm pretty sure, every single time I've been pulled over I've had drugs come to think of it. I just never gave them a reason to believe I was a drug user or had drugs on me. Also, know your rights. If you're licensed, and insured they can't rip you out of your car and start searching; so don't give them a reason to.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Hippiechick","4972","2013-11-30T17:15:47","Purchasing Bitcoins","Discussion/Security"," @Ferdinand: I use Coinbase with a verified, instant-purchase account. I've NEVER had a problem getting coins on the fly. And I do the same as you--send them through Blockchain's Shared Send feature, but instead of Tor I have a VPN so my ip address is anonymous. Only thing I don't do, and what scares me the most, is use bitfog, and you say that's the most important part. What does bitfog do that Shared Send through a VPN can't do?? Please let me know and I'll start using it for all future deposits.   One more thing, there is a forum post here by bitpro who is advertising his mixing service. It's a PGP encrypted service, so you have to PGP encrypt your deposit address before they will send you the forwarding address. I used it with $10.00 worth of bitcoin as a test, and my coins showed up fine. I checked the deposit address vs. my Coinbase address on the blockchain and the taint was 0. But the same thing goes for Shared Send. I can't find my Coinbase address associated with my deposit address when I use Shared Send either. So, again, what is the need for bitfog?   Thanks so much for any help you are able to give!  ~Hippiechick","Once you get your coins from coinbase, transfer them to an anonymous blockchain.info you set up via Tor, and run the coins through shared send. After shared send, run the coins through bitfog and then transfer to your SR wallet.If you start a process now, you'll be thankful later and then it will become very quick, except the bitfog part but that's the most important part so don't shortcut it."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Sandor Clegane","38173","2014-05-02T03:37:11","What is the most common way of getting caught?","Discussion/Legal"," Many people use their own names, or, at least a name that belongs at the addy your using. What you don't want is anything out of the ordinary, no red flags. Like a false name that the post office people are not used to seeing at that addy. You want the mail to just blend in with zero reason for anybody to think twice about it. Just one envelope out of the other 100 gazillion envelopes that pass thru the postal system everyday.   Remember, anybody can send anything to you. even if a package got caught for whatever oddball reason, they would need to prove that you ordered it.  Be careful in the buying process, encrypt everything, tumble BTC's, and that is very difficult. Even if you had to sign for whatever reason, they still gotta prove the rest. I've signed B4, it turns out express mail from Canada to the US, requires a sig even if it's waived by the sender. So, I signed and all went down without a hitch. I wouldn't recommend it, but, for small, personal use quantities of whatever, I don't think it's as taboo as some seem to think. Hell, I think it's kinda weird behavior to refuse to sign for something, who does that? Even if it's an unexpected, unknown package, most people think, in the backs of their minds, "" cool, I might be getting something good"". ","Side question - do you use your name when having items delivered to your home? And you should never be asked to sign? Right?"
"Silk Road 2 Forums","chikkenstorm","38173","2014-05-02T20:39:23","What is the most common way of getting caught?","Discussion/Legal"," Personally I always purchase BTC with my personal bank account and have them sent directly towards SR. I've received multiple letters from all over the world within a short period of time (I think my record is three in one week). Heck, on SR1 I didn't even use PGP. And yet I'm still here   I strongly recommend everyone to not follow my example ( seriously don't, for your own safety), but it's an example of how being sloppy doesn't automatically mean you'll get caught. It's not worth the effort for LE to catch small scale SR users anyway, I think. It's not just intercepting the one in a million(s) letter, but they'll also have to prove you're the one who ordered it. If they just want to bust a user for the stats, it's probably a lot easier to do so on the streets. Of course it depends on the country you live in (mine's pretty easy on the matter, so I can afford to be sloppy), but a vendor who knows what (s)he's doing (i.e. uses good stealth) goes a long way. It's those vendors with large stocks and ditto profits they're really after. With the precautions you say take you should be fine, as long as you don't get sloppy over time. From the stories I've read about vendors getting busted, being sloppy and feeling untouchable always was what brought them in.  This topic has wondering, though: has there ever been a buyer from SR (or any other market) who got arrested for receiving  small amounts only?","At most I use 3 tabs a month split between me and my partner.

When I was at the grocery store, I saw the kid coming back so I walked in to do my ""shopping"". Soon as I made it in, 4 cops grabbed me and 2 more grabbed him outside (why they had 4 coming for a 5'2 chick and only 2 for some gang member that might have a gun I don't know)  But long story short, I was feeling smug that they came too soon and no transaction had taken place. But they found money in my wallet and a cigarette pack in the kid with several bags in it and took us both in. I was charged with conspiracy to violate a drug law, that was actually worse than if they got me for possession. I had to spend 9 months on drug tests and per-trial, and at the end someone else they arrested that day testified against him, so they didn't need to get me anymore. I never got my money back, they said that was evidence.  In the USA, you can get arrested without actually doing anything illegal.

I actually LOLd when I read about this -- I just could not believe what I was reading in the affidavit. You really have to wonder...   If you order a fake id, it only stands to reason that you have just ONE per package. As far as his photos go, I wonder if he was planning to use them locally -- I can't see any need to have one's real photo on an ID unless you were planning to use it in such a way that someone would eyeball the photo and compare it to the person standing before them.    Great advice. Too bad Ross didn't think of it, huh?    Truer words were never spoken.    Here I have to disagree. If I were someone at risk, say a large vendor, I'd wipe the drive (using Dban) and then discard/destroy my computer and replace it with a new one. You want everything to be squeaky-clean.    That is where Ross failed, IMO. They used to tell us in the military:  ""If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.""   ""A lack of information can kill you.""   Last, but not least:  ""The more you sweat in training, the less you'll bleed on the battlefield.""   Ross clearly had no exit strategy. He had no Plan B.   He also did not have a grasp of security fundamentals -- one time that I recall, it took him 3 tries to successfully PGP-clearsign a post with the Silk Road backup URLs. His mastery of one of the primary security tools (PGP) was laughable. Furthermore, he was given advice by people who knew their shit, advice he totally ignored.    Unfortunately, as RxKing has pointed out, there are many vendors who did not have any funds salted away, in the case of such an eventuality as Silk Road closing or being seized.  For many of them, their primary sources of income are now gone.   For my part sadly, over time, I noticed an increasing number of customers who, by all appearances, could care less about security -- all they are thinking of, indeed all they _can_ think of, is getting their drugs. How many times have we seen plaintive wails to the effect of:   ""I just want to learn enough to make my first purchase.""    The worst such case I can remember involved a man who said he was from New York, and stated that his RL heroin connection had been busted. He was pleading for help to make a purchase so he would ""not be dope sick for Christmas.""    In one sense, it's a recipe for disaster -- you have vendors who, to put it mildly, are lackadaisical about security, and customers who are far more interested in getting their next fix than they are in staying out of jail.

Where security differs from religion is that security is NOT retroactive.  Unlike Christianity, where you can come to Jesus, be 'saved' and have all  your sins washed away, with security you can adopt Tails or PGP, and be  secure from that point forward, but rest assured that your previous sins  (security failings) WILL come back to haunt you and bite you in the ass.  DPR is the poster child for that, right now. ","Guys, it's been said many times before but I want to remind those of you in the U.S. of a few key points.If you're at risk of being raided, detained, questioned, or anything else from SR activities:1) Clean your house. Get rid of every single piece of incriminating evidence right now. Don't take any chances. Live to fight another day. ;2) If confronted, say NOTHING. Not a word. Ulbricht was an idiot when DHS came to his house over the fake IDs. He actually referenced Silk Road. Fucking idiot. Just keep your mouth shut. ""I'm sorry Sir / Ma'am, am I being detained? If not, I'd like to leave now. If I am being detained, I'd like to have a lawyer present before answering any of your questions."" ;They don't have anything on you just by having a log of your SR communications or transactions. It's possible to order drugs to an unsuspecting person's house. There have been many instances in which this has happened. So perhaps someone was online trying to do the same to you. You have no clue why your address is in SR messages. All you know is that you do not use drugs nor participate in any illegal activities. ""Silk Road? What is that?"" Don't acknowledge knowledge of this site. ""Tor? Is that even a word? I've never heard of it."" ;SR vendors are being busted around the world right now. They think they are invincible. Untraceable. LE loves that. In the U.S., they have to prove you are guilty. It isn't too hard when they catch you in the act. Lie low and let the storm pass. Relocate if you have to. There is nothing more important in life right now that staying out of prison. ;If you haven't already done so, encrypt your computers. Full disk encryption. Use truecrypt. Within your full disk encryption, put your Tor browser in a truecrypt volume and hide it among your files. Use a hidden container if you want to be safer and put dummy files in the outer container. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then get off of SR and go read about truecrypt, encrypted volumes, hidden volumes and full disk encryption. Law enforcement knows about these tools. You should too. ;If you're doing ANYTHING that will put you in jail or prison, then you should have the fundamentals down first (system encryption etc). Use Tails, whonix, whatever. Just know what you're doing. Don't make LE's job easy. ;For now, clear any evidence and don't say a fucking word if you're confronted. If you think the heat is on, take some time off.

FYI, there was wall to wall coverage of this shit last week when Ulricht when down. Any bust related is getting heavy buzz right now. Why? Because it's a fresh, new, and novel story that is not the same old shit of bangers shooting each other. What is ""scoring points in the media"" to you? If ""scoring points"" is having the media actually pay attention and write stories and give publicity to anything related to SR police action where the Ulricht thing was something out of Hollywood that publishers have been loving cashing in on, then yeah they would be scoring points BIG TIME.FYI: The streets fester in the cities the streets fester in regardless.

I come here because I'm an activist from way back and I have a serious interest in security/opsec. SR, like the other underground marketplaces, is a good place to learn. And now, perhaps, to give a little bit back.  I've been around the block a whole lot of decades in the anarchist community. I have seen warning signs of busts, I have seen busts (and been at the wrong end of them), and I have seen the utterly guilty walk while LE sat and fumed because they were sure they had the right people.   Take these warning seriously. LE do not bust in a purely rational manner. They bust key people of course, but they also bust to make an example out of someone, because someone else talked and made it easy for them, because they can confiscate a lot of valuable crap from someone and buy themselves an APC, and sometimes just because they can. Even if you are some nobody who bought a little pot, if you used less than perfect security and/or you were exposed by a careless and tattling dealer, you might be busted. Busting you becomes easy, the Feds want to send a message to this community and the world that they are Borg, and your local LE wants to get in the SR busts act. If you are in a small community and your local LE is handed some evidence against you, there is a very good chance they'll get a search warrant, because its boring sitting behind the billboard with a radar gun all day, and because they can.  Keep in mind also that politicians have been demanding LE bust SR for years. Farmer's Market is not a precedent. Al Qaeda is probably a closer precedent: a group of no more than 100 jihadis, probably smaller than a lot of criminal gangs, and we invaded how many countries now, sent in drones and armored divisions, and we're still fighting in Afghanistan even though US intelligence estimates less than a dozen Al Qaeda left in the country. SR is a political target.They want to make an example of SR.  Yes, even if they can only hang a misdemenor on you. We're talking local cops handed a bucket of evidence by the Feds so that they don't even have to think about it. If your local LE would bust you for finding a joint on your dashboard, they'd bust you for finding a joint on your internet connection if the Feds do all the finding for them.   Odds are, yes, you won't be the winner of a knock knock (or the crashing of a ram) on the door. Probably the evidence won't be so clear against you, and probably someone else will look more deserving of their attention. But you won't know it for certain until you are busted. Waiting until you are sure there's a threat to you is just plain crazy because by then it is way too late  Act now -- and I mean now, as in right after you read this, because you don't know when things might go down -- to clean up your act by whatever means you feel are appropriate and necessary to your situation. Assume the worst and position yourself to counter it.   Remember never to talk to the police - not even to say ""I'm innocent"", because once you open your mouth they will keep you talking till you stick your foot in it. Cops overstate the strength of their evidence against you in interrogation all the time. Remember when they offer to go easy on you if you confess or rat on others, that they almost never really do, and that no sentence is easier than getting off because you kept your mouth shut. What you won't read in the newspapers is that overworked prosecutors often drop cases without physical evidence (you did clean up, right?), without an eyewitness, and without a confession.   If you have the means, lawyer up now, and follow their advice. I'm not a lawyer, just a two-time guilty-as-hell defendant who walked thanks to opsec and luck (and one prosecution witness who confessed to committing a crime against me during his testimony. I kid you not. He put the ""dumb"" in ""dumbass"").   For heaven's sake please don't ask anyone who warns you that they've been busted or leaks LEO information, for details like location, type and quantity of drugs, and name of department. It isn't hard to correlate that kind of information with particular individuals. The user who has warned you here of user busts has taken a big risk to do so. I'm guessing his lawyer is praying to the witness who resides in the aforementioned heaven of the first part, that what he has posted here won't end up in court as evidence. In fact I would not at all be surprised if there have been more busts than we know already, and that the busted were told, wisely, by their lawyers to keep their mouth shut, before they could run here and talk. Just listen, absorb, and evaluate the information for plausibility, and act on what makes sense. But don't be complacent because they are out to get you.  Finally: TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS-- IF YOUR GUT SAYS DEEP TROUBLE, LISTEN TO IT AND ACT IMMEDIATELY. Sorry for shouting but I cannot emphasize that enough. We humans have a much neglected instinct as prey animals, probably left over from the days we were the appetizer on the saber tooth tiger dinner menu. We subconsciously process when things become too quiet, when people act funny, when a car with a different engine rolls down the street, when footsteps no louder than a whisper pause outside our window. This instinct rarely gives us more than a few minutes warning, but that's plenty of time to power down, flush what has to be flushed, or sometimes even get the hell out before the circle around you closes tight.",""

Well, fortunately while they are still authorized to use that many units, the higher-ups told them it's looking much more like a fraction of that. We're talking 20-60 individuals rather than hundreds.  This number is STILL subject to change, but for now that's what the word is. Apparently they are very much trying to sort out what they are wanting to do, and the impression I got is that they are just as clueless as most of us are as to how to handle this situation.  -In terms of information from SR being used against us, the answers this person got when asking about what will be used and how, this person said it seems they are not sure of how they want to use what info they got. As if over night my sources opinion is that things look like they blew over. This person specifically stated that everything that was 100% encrypted on the site is more or less untouchable and not in the LE's line of site.  Before the weekend, I got the initial phone call and this person sounded very serious about this being a huge operation. That they had never seen this many units in their division authorized for any one cause. For whatever reason it is their opinion after digging into it at todays meeting when things were supposed to get underway, that it is not going to be the epic proportion that they thought. Still, my person will be cross referencing all of this with other agencies as we speak. So, basically, the number of units authorized for serving SR related warrants from their division still stands at its initial potential, but at the meeting today regarding its firepower has been dialed down substantially.  Perhaps they are confused on how to attack this? Perhaps they aren't even feeding my informant the truth, and that they want it to seem low key for now? I'm not sure. I'm not here with answers, just information. This was good news either way.",""

Not this again!","312","2013-10-12T23:22:16","Friend in law enforcement rang me today, putting together large task forces.","Discussion/Security","Given your grammar, you should speak for yourself. (BTW there are scant facts if any in your post--this is your opinion) *seized through civil asset forfeiture* They want to make some high profile busts to make a point. There won't be a TON of arrests though, especially for end users. They also might grab some of the low hanging fruit just to scare people. Again, speak for yourself. They don't really give a fuck. And that's not why they took down SR. They pursued SR 1st because it was the biggest market with the most publicity; but, SR was NOT the 1st online drug market shut down by the Fed's. The Farmers Market was around 5 years old when they shut it down somewhere between 2011-12. And it was shuttered by the Feds for the exact same reason as SR (i.e. huge user base); it's not about severing people's connections. They're not fucking retarded; they know you can find another dealer. I agree that this is illogical and impractical (if not impossible). That doesn't mean individual buyers won't get busted. They might go after wholesale buyers (aka distributors). Huh? That doesn't make sense. You mean to say they don't have the resources to bust us all, and I agree, but I don't know why you think the media would cover that angle. First of all, municipal police aren't going to be the ones doing the investigating. Where YOU live is irrelevant. You're one TINY corner of the world is NOT representative of the ENTIRE world. The Feds might have the state/county/local police accompany them when they're serving a warrant, but your municipal police are NOT running the investigation (i.e. if they're even involved at all). No. SR was targeted because of the number of users and the volume of sales. Again, look to the bust of TFM. The general public was largely unaware that TFM existed. Try again. Maybe. Anyone can find there way onto BMR or SM through the clearnet. You can find BMR's forums thanks to onion.to indexing onion sites. And you can find the link to BMR in other press coverage anyway. SM has a page on clearnet with it's address and information on the marketplace. (BTW you sound--and write--like a 10 year old   They've got PMs and unencrypted addresses. I'm sure that many of those who didn't use GPG weren't super careful about how they got/transferred their BTC. So if someone had a Mt Gox account (which many did), they can follow the coins from your Gox account. And then there are the folks who used Dwolla or bank wires, both of which are obviously tied to your bank account. I could go on ... Why? A TINY bit of paranoia is healthy if you've repeatedly broken the law. Nobody really knows what kind of records vendors were keeping. Just because SR didn't allow it officially doesn't mean that some vendors didn't create a customer database. Nobody knows exactly how many arrests have been made, the SR aliases of all of those who were arrested, or if any of those vendors are providing information to the Feds in exchange for lighter sentences.  So what? That doesn't mean they can't locate a vendor. If you'd been paying attention, you'd know that they busted one vendor who'd been using a UPS Store mailbox as the return address for all his shipments, which would've been OK (stupid, but OK) had the Feds not intercepted one of his packages of heroin. In cases like that, they just need to do light surveillance to identify the seller. OK. Even if they ONLY have the image from 23/7/2013 and ALL unencrypted pending orders as of 1/10/2013, that could potentially be a ton of unencrypted addresses, given both the traffic of SR and the number of users not using GPG. And that also gives them access to users' buying histories (don't know how it works for vendors). They'd have everyone's buying history for June and July from the July image along with their histories for August/September/October that were stored on the site when it was taken down. That's a lot of damning information if you're a bulk buyer. It also ties you to specific vendors (you know, like if they stumble upon you while investigating a vendor?) I don't know how you're so confident that they only had access to the site for ONE day when it was cloned, but OK I'll go along. The only reason this matters is that Ulbricht was chatting with a government witness about SR (aka a setup) and was logged in as the site admin, both of which help them make the case that Ulbricht is DPR. Having him log in before arresting him was meant as a smoking gun to tie Ulbricht to DPR. That's why they set him up with the chat too. (I'll overlook the possibility that his log-in timed out by the time they got to search it). Oh OK. Nothing personal, but you come across like an asshole. There were a wide array of answers; they all did not agree. Only your pearls of wisdom contain the REAL ""truth.""

This has been a recurring theme during Obama's presidency. Congress has been making a show out of a normally routine event (the debt ceiling has been raised a gazillion times before--it didn't become an issue until 2010).  You don't understand; it's not just about funding. The government takes in money every day, but it's not enough to cover every expenditure. They'll agree to raise the debt limit somewhere by 10/16 probably as close to midnight as possible.  They've got to or else the US will default on it's debts.   Anyway, the point is, even if they don't raise the debt ceiling, that does NOT mean the US ""government simply does not have the money to pay"" these agents. They'll still have money. Tax receipts come in steadily. They don't take in enough per day to fully fund the government, which is obviously where the need to borrow comes in.  They'll prioritize payments, but I guaran-fucking-tee that LEAs (especially the FBI and NSA) get funded. Same for most of the military. They'll skip making interest payments on debts; they'll also cut all non-essential services; and shit, they'll fuck over senior citizens, the poor, and the disabled by not funding the safety net programs before they ever even THINK of NOT funding LEAs.   Sad    ","Remember that the US is reaching the debt limit and soon they will be unable to borrow anymore money.  This will probably have an affect on LEA because the government simply does not have the money to pay them.  I hope DEA/FBI/NSA loose their funding and don't get paid.  Granted the congress and White House appear to be in negotiations to solve this issue ASAP."

Well, fortunately while they are still authorized to use that many units, the higher-ups told them it's looking much more like a fraction of that. We're talking 20-60 individuals rather than hundreds.  This number is STILL subject to change, but for now that's what the word is. Apparently they are very much trying to sort out what they are wanting to do, and the impression I got is that they are just as clueless as most of us are as to how to handle this situation.-In terms of information from SR being used against us, the answers this person got when asking about what will be used and how, this person said it seems they are not sure of how they want to use what info they got. As if over night my sources opinion is that things look like they blew over. This person specifically stated that everything that was 100% encrypted on the site is more or less untouchable and not in the LE's line of site.Before the weekend, I got the initial phone call and this person sounded very serious about this being a huge operation. That they had never seen this many units in their division authorized for any one cause. For whatever reason it is their opinion after digging into it at todays meeting when things were supposed to get underway, that it is not going to be the epic proportion that they thought. Still, my person will be cross referencing all of this with other agencies as we speak. So, basically, the number of units authorized for serving SR related warrants from their division still stands at its initial potential, but at the meeting today regarding its firepower has been dialed down substantially.Perhaps they are confused on how to attack this? Perhaps they aren't even feeding my informant the truth, and that they want it to seem low key for now? I'm not sure. I'm not here with answers, just information. This was good news either way.Unless your friend is federal law enforcement, he/she doesn't have any useful knowledge about what's happening. There is no way the federal agents are telling local law enforcement anything about encryption on the site or strategies for pursuing people. The FBI and other federal agencies only share information when they absolutely must. I think what may have happened is your friend and others got a massive hard-on when they heard about the SR bust and started preparing to kick ass...but the call never came in. Kind of like when a country is attacked, every soldier gets excited to go ""see action"" but the energy quickly passes.Bottom line: no offense to your friend, but unless he is federal, he don't know shit."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Oh no! Not this again!","312","2013-10-11T20:25:57","Friend in law enforcement rang me today, putting together large task forces.","Discussion/Security","Couple of points about this post on Reddit:  1. It involved local police as well as Feds. That means if this person was a buyer, he wasn't busted over weed. This must have involved hard drugs. I'd imagine that it was large-ish quantities (of coke, meth, heroin, or Rx). If it was weed, then it was an ass-load of fucking bud. I say that because recreational marijuana is legal in WA. The police are supposedly not complying with the FBI/DEA/US Attorney's Office on recreational marijuana busts that are within the new WA law. Same is allegedly true of CO.  2. It specifically says he was one of Nod's customers, so we already know he bought a decent quantity of hard drugs from someone who had a shipment intercepted previously (aka Nod). Anyone who bought from Nod should be extremely concerned.  3. It also mentions that it was a FELONY quantity. All hard drug possession is felonious, but NOT weed -- that would depend on quantity.   This gives me reason to believe that they are NOT interested in recreational weed (or even shrooms) buyers. I expected them to come down hard  drug buyers before I'd even read this. Anyone who bought more than a few grams of meth or coke at one time should be worried. Anyone who bought Rx medication MIGHT want to worry. I don't know how much heroin would be considered enough for the US Attorney's Office to file charges, but I'd say if you bought more than a medium-ish amount, you should probably worry.  And as for buyer arrests, ""don't worry 'bout the law/they can't arrest us all.""  No seriously, they're not going to prosecute every single SR buyer. It's too expensive and offers too few benefits. It's harmful to society--I could expand on this, but I'm keeping it simple; it's harmful to the government/economy too--and mass prosecution offers few benefits to justify the enormous costs (think:they have to gather enough evidence to convict EVERY buyer in separate trials and it uses a large number of very limited personnel who could otherwise  be better engaged in investigating/prosecuting much more serious crimes). And the federal prison system is way too overloaded; it's clogged with drug offenders as it is, without adding all SR buyers to the mix.  Believe it or not, LE really does a cost/benefit analysis informally as to whether or not a bust is worth the time and paperwork required,  they're chances of securing a conviction/plea, and the degree of danger the individual poses to society at large. I'm related to a county level prosecutor/former public defender/criminal defense attorney, so I have some insight into how this works (at the state level at least).   And even if you're arrested, if it's not worth their time, prosecutors won't file charges. They don't blindly follow the police in terms of choosing who to prosecute. ","The OP and a post on reddit describing an arrest in WA state USA.Also is a post on the old forums with same type of information."

First of all, you should have said BUD instead of molly. As far as molly and alcohol go, I don't think one is any more or less harmful than the other; that's bullshit.

And Nod used a return address linked to his fake name in order to retrieve any packages returned. Conspiracy goes when u have an actual person you can point the finger at. Or some  physical evidence other than words. Its enough for a search warrant. Take PlutoPete for instance, he had his real info plastered on Sr so they looked him up. They didnt break the code and come and get him. It takes money to run traces on btc addresses and warrants and all that police shit. And one wrong address with this virtual currency and your left holding your dick. Me personally, I think the fbi has hit a rode block somewhere.

Insurance companies are required to report terminated policies in most states. [/quote]   Only retards and mules travel with large amounts of drugs/currency in their cars. That's why mules are used; they're completely expendable (well, that's not the only reason, but it's still true). And only even bigger retards would mouth off to a cop while doing so.","Alot of people may not have noticed but alot of the Police have military style uniforms now.;They are getting all kinds of new electronics too, like license plate scanner/readers.;They dont seem to  want to bother with things like no Insurance (when driving).;Also if you even smart off to them they will fuck your shit up fast.If your traveling with Drugs/Currency please make sure to vacuum pack it and hide it well inside your door panels or deep inside the chassis.Car upholstery/interior removing tools are easy to get, so learn to do it right.And do not get smart with these guys or you going to have a bad time."

It involved local police as well as Feds. That means if this person was a buyer, he wasn't busted over weed. This must have involved hard drugs. I'd imagine that it was large-ish quantities (of coke, meth, heroin, or Rx). If it was weed, then it was an ass-load of fucking bud. I say that because recreational marijuana is legal in WA. The police are supposedly not complying with the FBI/DEA/US Attorney's Office on recreational marijuana busts that are within the new WA law. Same is allegedly true of CO.;Edit 2: My inbox is inundated with messages and I'll try to reply to everyone when I have a chance. Here's a quick general update to my situation before I go take care of other stuff for the day - apologies if I get some of the legal information incorrect, I'm not a lawyer, so it's not my area of expertise: I just got done meeting with my lawyer and his firm. They're working on my case as kind of a group effort thing apparently, since Tor-related cases aren't very common. I guess they're working over time to get up to speed on everything for all their clients. I've received about 20 private messages from other throwaway accounts saying they're in the same boat, so it looks like it's not isolated. My lawyer told me that if the possession charge wasn't there, they probably wouldn't have bothered, but since they found the stuff, they went after me and will likely try and get as much information off my computer, cell phone, etc as possible. They advised me not to discuss specifics to my case outside of their office for now. I'm trying to listen to them as much as I can, but I'll do my best to give out info, since more people might be dealing with the same shit in the future."

No, in fact, they can't just pull cops from the suburbs to fight inner-city crime. I'm not speaking theoretically, this is recurring argument in the US. For one, the tax payers in the suburbs are staunchly against their tax dollars going to fight crime in cities they don't live in. They'd rather have their cops hanging out in doughnut shops and convenience stores chatting than have them dispatched to the inner city.   You're talking about 2 different kinds of LE: detectives vs patrolmen. They're not interchangeable.  Google News appears differently to each unique user. This is a long story, but there are almost NO SR stories in my Google News feed. In fact, the day that SR was shutdown, I didn't believe it at first because it didn't appear in the news I'd read that day. I had to search for it to find it. There were one or two stories about it the next two days, but after that back to none. It's all served up based on user preferences (and Google's aggressive mining).   And if he were posting here you'd be trying to clown him all the same so what's your point? FWIW, it looks like did return to answer some questions from posters. Nor is everyone as brilliant as you think you are so you should think about cutting those who didn't inherit you superior genes some slack. That way if you're wrong you won't feel like such an implicit fail.[/quote] I think the point here is that Reddit is a known troll haven; I think. Also, I think he meant that this (or the old forum) would be the FIRST place a SR user would run to talk about their arrest. At least you'd know here that you were reaching your target audience.   I was willing to go along with you until I got here! Are you telling me that you view this thread as a credible source for LE activity? You can't be serious.   Again, I have to stop you here. First of all, some of us know exactly what's up. Some of us have experience in law; others have life experience. Some of us know what will happen because SR is NOT the 1st market to be busted. The Farmers Market was much older and much bigger when they got busted. That happened in 2011. You can research that. It was a global sting as well. LE is usually predictable (I can't say who will and won't get busted specifically, but I know small-to-midsized buyers are NOT going to be busted if they aren't stumbled upon accidentally).   This is false equivalence. You can't compare the costs of a lengthy criminal investigation (not to mention prosecution) to a one day visit from the president. Even if you mean just the shift in manpower, it's only ONE day.   Different strokes for different folks I guess. I don't know what you're buying or selling (NOT asking), but to me, the paranoia is illogical and is far too stressful over something that most certainly isn't going to happen (but my largest ever SR purchase was a QP of bud -- well I bought a QP of shrooms too, but they were cheaper). The paranoia isn't worth it to someone who buys like an ounce of weed and 10 Adderall a month; I know that if the postal inspectors ever find my package, I'm fucked. But that's 100% out of my control. I'd rather get high. Speaking of which ...","So I'm left to ask you, are YOU American or just posing as one?

Because it's a fresh, new, and novel story that is not the same old shit of bangers shooting each other. What is ""scoring points in the media"" to you?

No one knows what's up, yet you seem so sure. If they start busting buyers are you really going to be surprised because cops chose not to patrol their normal beats those days? I won't. If Obama came to visit the city ALL the cops would be called to a task force to assignments protecting the motorcade.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Oh no! Not this again!","312","2013-10-12T04:53:32","Friend in law enforcement rang me today, putting together large task forces.","Discussion/Security","OK, First of all, you're talking about a very simple arrest. This is not something that requires a long-term investigation. And I'd like to add that people are speaking about arrests and convictions are one in the same. Prosecutors have the final decision as to whether to file charges or not. So even if you're right that a cop can't ever walk away from a bust, that doesn't mean that the prosecutor's office will agree to spend their resources prosecuting someone.   And second, the enforcement of laws is completely discretionary; they have finite resources. I can tell you that I personally know a prosecutor and that you're mistaken in you're belief (I'm not saying that in any way protects me from getting busted). I'm also NOT saying you (or anyone else) is stupid for thinking that; it's a reasonable assumption, but it's just not the reality.  There's a cost (i.e. cost of investigation/resources diverted from other crimes) vs benefit (harm to society caused by crime) analysis in LE. They're also going to consider whether the crime and risk of not securing a conviction is worth the manpower needed, which is why you'll get away with a hell of a lot more in a big city than you would in a tiny suburb (less crime=more resources=more time to arrest you for petty offenses).   The idea that it's all about ""pats on the back"" is naive at best. It's about dollars in your annual budget. You get more funding by securing more convictions for serious crimes. If your entire budget is spent investigating petty misdemeanor/disorderly persons offenses, two things will happen: you'll lack the resources needed to fight other forms of crime, and you'll end up having your budget and/or personnel slashed. If the worst thing happening in your town is a bunch of teens smoking joints, then people are going to say that your department is majorly over-funded. Who needs to pay detectives for that?  They'll try to take your funding away for their own pet projects. LE is a numbers game; it's all about securing more funding.  ","Why would they not go after peeps they have dead to rights?Its their job, they will get pats on the back, maybe even more funding.And of course news stories.They are gonna absolutely love this shit.I dont see them ever just walking away from a bust, or a plaintext address they have from an illegal drug site."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Oh no! Not this again!","312","2013-10-12T05:08:05","Friend in law enforcement rang me today, putting together large task forces.","Discussion/Security","While it's a myth that they actually need to catch you in possession of drugs to bust you, it's true that they're unlikely to waste time and money on prosecuting small buyers. They can prosecute based on wiretaps and surveillance alone. The law is all about intent.   If they had access to your SR buyer history (contrary to what some people think, transactions weren't deleted immediately from buyers' accounts). They were stored for a certain amount of time before being deleted. So a month or so of those and your address, along with any other circumstantial evidence, would be enough to at least file charges, depending on what kind of buying you do.  And I think where people really go wrong with this kind of thinking is that people who use drugs tend to replace them after they are consumed. So say they got a search warrant based on the information above (not impossible), when they searched the house, they'd probably find drugs, whether they're the same drugs or not is irrelevant. Well, you could try to make the argument I guess, but you'd look like a fool.  With all that said, the only buyers who need to worry are those that could appear to be resellers (i.e. buying wholesale quantities -- whether selling them or not). Even then, it's only going t be the largest of them.","Quote from: Pharmington Rex on October 11, 2013, 05:57:31 pmRemember the old adage ""possession is 9/10th of the law?"" This is why they won't bother going after anyone they suspect has cleaned house already. Having unencrypted messages and addresses from weeks or months ago is not actionable intelligence as it would be assumed that the drugs acquired during that time were either consumed or distributed already.They assume you are a drug addict which has very likely always drugs in his surroundings cause he needs them.LE thinks different that's why they are confident they will find something.I know this for sure from non US countries, I don't know how the US LE handles this.

Else there wouldn't be so much ink devoted to writing about it for the laymen.   That's not what I was talking about. Wasn't referring to sourcing cops from the burbs to take over the beats of inner city cops. That would seem really inefficient. I was talking about sourcing from the burbs to bust dealers in the burbs.   My question was a rhetorical one. But with the kind of op the OP was talking about it sounded like patrolmen.   I got that part, which is why I said he should cut others some slack who don't think like him. Maybe you missed the rhetorical nature of my question again and missed my point. So just to be clear, I see little motivation for him to want to come here just to get flamed as a liar and FUD rat. If you check the reddit post the guy seems to have followed up and appears legit. Different strokes.   With all due respect, were you high when you were reading this? Let me spell out what I said here for you again (asterisked emphasis mine):  ""Have you even followed this thread? They either have been conducting surveillance of buyers AS WELL as sellers for the vendors they're going to round up, *or they haven't*. If they have, then that will be the smoking gun.""  I was going off the reddit post and speculating on how they would bust buyers if in fact that were true based on the operational details of what he said. I also pointed out that if they weren't conducting surveillance they wouldn't because where would be the evidence? I'm not sure what you read. I've also made the point multiple times throughout that I have no idea wtf is up and have treated everything as it should be treated ... speculative. It does bothers me though when people come to threads like this to flame the OP since it would seem to discourage anyone from even wanting to bother if they've got a legit tip. Take it for what it is, if the OP's full of shit you can flame him later. There's a difference between being respectfully skeptical and a fucking prick.   Again, you missed the point. Assuming the truth of the reddit report that's a lot of buyer roundups just for each seller bust. The investigation is irrelevant because it's already been complete. Roundups really shouldn't be taking more than ONE DAY should it?   Yeah it probably won't happen for you. But then again it doesn't sound like you bought much and what you did buy is probably further down the priority list of the kinds of dope they're pursuing. If you had bought from Nod though you'd be an imbecile to blow off the reddit report. That's always been my point. The guy today posted that his lawyer told him that if they didn't find any product on his premises they probably wouldn't have pursued him further. But finding him in possession is what will make the purchase charges stick. If that's not a good reason to clean house then you tell me what is. YMMV, use your own discretion. If you don't think this stuff applies to you, then don't worry about it. ","I don't think non-drug users regard this to be as novel as we do. ;No, in fact, they can't just pull cops from the suburbs to fight inner-city crime. I'm not speaking theoretically, this is recurring argument in the US. For one, the tax payers in the suburbs are staunchly against their tax dollars going to fight crime in cities they don't live in. They'd rather have their cops hanging out in doughnut shops and convenience stores chatting than have them dispatched to the inner city. ;You're talking about 2 different kinds of LE: detectives vs patrolmen. They're not interchangeable.;I think the point here is that Reddit is a known troll haven; I think. Also, I think he meant that this (or the old forum) would be the FIRST place a SR user would run to talk about their arrest. At least you'd know here that you were reaching your target audience.;I was willing to go along with you until I got here! Are you telling me that you view this thread as a credible source for LE activity? You can't be serious.;This is false equivalence. You can't compare the costs of a lengthy criminal investigation (not to mention prosecution) to a one day visit from the president. Even if you mean just the shift in manpower, it's only ONE day. ;Different strokes for different folks I guess. I don't know what you're buying or selling (NOT asking), but to me, the paranoia is illogical and is far too stressful over something that most certainly isn't going to happen (but my largest ever SR purchase was a QP of bud -- well I bought a QP of shrooms too, but they were cheaper). The paranoia isn't worth it to someone who buys like an ounce of weed and 10 Adderall a month; I know that if the postal inspectors ever find my package, I'm fucked. But that's 100% out of my control. I'd rather get high. Speaking of which ..."

You won't hear it IRL much in America but I've still seen it in enough sign offs by Americans that it's not uncommon to use either. I'll hear it a lot also from Australians living, working, and doing drugs here too. So who the fuck cares how he signs off his posts? Whether his tip is real or not, the fact he says ""Cheers"" is not the magic clue that lets you crack the crypto sherlock.   So I'm left to ask you, are YOU American or just posing as one? FYI, there was wall to wall coverage of this shit last week when Ulricht when down. Any bust related is getting heavy buzz right now. Why? Because it's a fresh, new, and novel story that is not the same old shit of bangers shooting each other. What is ""scoring points in the media"" to you? If ""scoring points"" is having the media actually pay attention and write stories and give publicity to anything related to SR police action where the Ulricht thing was something out of Hollywood that publishers have been loving cashing in on, then yeah they would be scoring points BIG TIME.  FYI: The streets fester in the cities the streets fester in regardless. Cops can be sourced from surrounding suburbs if manpower is needed. But if they assign officers that normally patrol the hood, explain to me, who in the hood complains? Who outside of the hood complains?   Yes because all that other shit is old news.

Nor is everyone as brilliant as you think you are so you should think about cutting those who didn't inherit you superior genes some slack. That way if you're wrong you won't feel like such an implicit fail.   Have you even followed this thread? They either have been conducting surveillance of buyers AS WELL as sellers for the vendors they're going to round up, or they haven't. If they have, then that will be the smoking gun.     Sounds like you're unraveling here. No one knows what's up, yet you seem so sure. If they start busting buyers are you really going to be surprised because cops chose not to patrol their normal beats those days? I won't. If Obama came to visit the city ALL the cops would be called to a task force to assignments protecting the motorcade. Why is it a stretch to think they'd do this?

Arresting buyers of small quantities of drugs is something the feds will definitely NOT do, because they get paid too much to prosecute low level users. A guy like NOD would be a priority federal case, since the charges involved warranted automatic sentencing and it worth the time and money. They only want big fish because otherwise its a waste of man hours. The smaller fries will be brought in and then pleaded out (probation) or they'll drop charges if they flip (work as CE's). SR bust, as far as the FBI's involvement, is over once they announce to the press the big score.   I think what is possible is that the FBI and other federal agencies will make available their database of buyers and sellers from the SR data they collected, and then have them online for local LE, Sheriffs, State Drug tasks forces, etc.  At this point it would be up to the jurisdiction but you could see where the locals might round up people for State prosecution (they get paid bonuses from the Feds based on how many arrests so there's motivation here). That is likely,  however, I only think they'd get realllly small fish at this point, unless they have been working with the FBI along (unlikely) since everyone big (large vendors) will have cleaned house.   A federal investigation with GPS tracker warrants, following packages from post offices, etc. like they did on NOD (I read the complaint twice), is NOT cheap, and if they did it on some other vendor, it would have wrapped up by now with arrests.  Also just hypothetically speaking about the OP, it sounds like a European talking and it's total bullshit probably.

Since they were monitoring his deliveries already for a month, presuming because they were tracking every shipment being sent by the slinger they busted like Nod, and the busts confirmed his address on a slinger's home machine ... that's already air tight.  I would imagine the mail covers program would be more about tracking down a seller. They order on SR, scan in the appearance of the packaging, then use the mail covers program to find a match from the area it was sent from and all the packages that were sent using similar packaging and what mailboxes and post offices they were sent from. They then alert the postmaster in those areas to keep a lookout for who is bringing in those types of packages. If they already know who the buyer and seller is they're already tracking the packages he's sending so no need for mail cover matches.   Yeah I did consider that. But the way I see it why take the chance that it's a troll? It's far better err on the side of caution with this by taking it seriously until further notice. It was well written for a troll and sounds very genuine but of course you never know.  He did say he would followup tomorrow though so I guess we'll see.   If they were monitoring your address for the past month as you were accepting deliveries like the poster said then fuck yeah. The dealer's database just seals the deal at that point.  Taking the reddit post into account not alone but ALONG with what the OP said is what lends some credibility.   But again, this could just be rounding up the fallout from Nod. Until they start taking down slingers in other states this could be completely self contained in Washington. But if the OP's post is legit and they do round up slingers, then it sounds like buyers might very well be rounded up too.   ","Feds also have a photograph of every package ever mailed, and envelopes.

The sellers that were arrested, their investigations were ongoing for months so why were they just arrested now as one thing? LE has done a coordinated strike. This could only be done for two reasons:  1) To not alert anyone of an impending bust, and thus allowing people to clean house 2) To spread fear about the fact that LE will catch you, even though all the busts thus far were people who were not very careful.

The silver lining with all of this is that we probably have a lower profile now that the public assumes SR went down and the DPR is gone.  Enough with the niceties, I wanted to know if using library computers (no id required) w/ Tor on a flash drive has any advantages over using it from your home?  To use an encrypted flash drive at a library you will need to install truecrypt, thus necessitating the need for admin rights. I've been searching but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get past admin rights.    I thought I should get an old laptop to be able to connect using various wifi hotspots, but then I need to use some personal info to access the wifi.   I just want to find a more secure way to do this that is also more convenient.   Does anyone have ideas how I can either hack admin rights or hack wifi passwords? Looks like I need to get on Khan Academy and get some computer hacking skills to go along with my bow-staff skills ;-) Seriously how do people new to hacking learn this stuff? I know there is a convention for hackers in las vegas, but from what I've seen from that is way over most people's heads/beginners.   From what I know about entrance nodes and exits nodes is that your ISP can see you enter tor, but as long as you stay in https (i.e. don't expose exit nodes) then they won't know what you are browsing. I would think that if you placed an order and LEO were going to do a CD then they would probably check with your ISP just to see if you enter tor.

Being in posession of a GPS reciever does not allow someone to track your location.  Generally speaking, if someone is tracking your location based on actual GPS this is accomplished by getting software onto your device which will read your location from the reciever and then transmit that location back to the tracker via a data network.  The GPS satellites alone will not tell anyone your location.  And, also, keep in mind that those GPS signals are pretty weak by the time they reach us down here on planet Earth.   If, for instance, you're looking for a GPS enabled tracking device on your vehicle, it's probably not working well buried in the undercarriage.  My guess would be these need to be in a wheel well or right under the hood to be effectve unless a remote antenna is involved which would make it way harder to install covertly.  Try running GPS in the deep woods and you'll see just what I mean.  Generally speaking, when LE track someone's location using the cellular network, it's by triangulation between cell towers.  This has nothing to do with the uni-directional GPS system and everything to do with the bi-directional cellular system.  Our phones are consrtantly on-air now, chattering away, updating our email or even just in the act of roaming from cell to cell.  It's those uplink transmissions that allow the cellular network to map our location and movement.  Even without full triangulation, typical in sparsely populated areas, if you're in motion between cell sites your location can be very accurately determined.  If you're static within a single cell, now they just have a radius of probability and not much of an actual location.  But the more cells that see you on-air, the more accurately your position can be determined.  Some phones have a debug mode that will allow you to see how many cell sites the device can hear.  So, for instance, if my opsec dictates that I attempt to anonymize my internet access, I'd buy myself a pre-pay modem (e.g. Verizon MiFi), drive somewhere reasonably rural, turn it on to do my shit, turn it off, drive somewhere new, turn it on, etc.  And with today's phones, the only reliable way to ensure you aren't being tracked is to remove the battery.  It's just so easy to end up with software on your iPhone or Android phone that's going to give you up.  Use a pre-pay burner phone that doesn't run aribtrary software for voice.  Use a fixed-function cellular modem that also doesn't run arbitrary software.  Turn them on only when you need them.  If you do need to secure a multi-function ""smart"" phone, once step you should take is to disable the WiFi and Bluetooth radios as well as the data over cellular function.  That won't make it impossible to track you, but will reduce the available methods.  Of course, starting with a fresh install of the OS would make sense too.  Hope this is useful to someone and others contribute.  Location tracking via radio networks is becoming an increasingly pervasive capability and definitely something we should all be thinking about.  * Quick subnote.  Technically triangulation (there's another geometry term used as well) isn't the only way to plot location.  TDOA (time difference of arrival) is another method.  But it still requires you to be visible to multiple transcievers for any accuracy.",""

True enough, but a fixed unit (as in where the orientation is known) can use a relatively large active patch antenna which can significantly increase gain far beyond what you would get with a hand-portable GPS unit where the orientation is variable. These things provide fairly sensitive reception coupled with good gain and can work surprisingly well even with obstructions in place. In built up urban environments though they're not that hot.   Yes its an interesting topic. It is worth bearing in mind that UMTS and LTE user equipment support a variety of location request services some of which are network originated. There are a number of variants including one specifically present (it is mandatory in the specifications) for Lawful Intercept use. Any licensed phone must respond to these requests if it is able to and some will augment data with user equipment positioning information and they may include GPS dervied co-ordinates and/or wi-fi derived location.  If you get a burner, go for an old 2G phone without GPRS support whih are unable to respond with much at all.  An old trick which is still used in the ""silent call"" which is relatively well documented now. It involves getting the network (be that a real network or a fake mobile network) to establish a silent call to the mobile handset. Traditional radio DF is then used to pinpoint the mobile device as it will be transmitting.  There are phones on the market that will randomize or at least allow user configured IMEI numbers but unless you are also using multiple SIMs they just stand out like a sore thumb on account of the one to many relationship you end up with between the IMSI to the IMEI.  Most IMSI catchers deployed by LE will always capture IMSI and IMEI and most will provide the silent call functionality for DFing. Some will even have uplinks to the real network so they can MiTM voice calls.   Yes TDOA is what most  cellular providers tend to use it seems and where user equipment supports it, this may be augmented with GPS data as mentioned above.

This is great guidance for general RF countermeasures.  I threw bold on #4 for two reasons. 1) Modern people get lazy about maintaining their tools and eventually don't even know what their tools look like in correct operational state vs. incorrect.  I stopped maintining my vehicles for years and when I finally rolled under one I was shocked by what I saw and that I had let it go so long unmonitored.  The same applies for many people and their tech.  If your tech is operationally important to your business, know the basics of how it operates.  Pay attention to operational states and eventually you'll develop some natural sense of when things are or are not working properly.  2) On the other had, recognize that if the rest of your OPSEC is strong, the odds of being targeted with these methods should be quite low.  Yes, recent revelations of US Agency data hoovering are disturbing, but even then you need to make yourself a target to some extent before anyone will look at the relevant data.  As far as postal intercept of equipment, again, how likely is it that you've exposed yourself enough for that to happen?  If you think it's possible, you should probably worry more about your overall security posture than who you buy your USB flash drives from.  These attacks don't work without targeting.  There's no satellite receiving transmission from thousands of radio tapped flash drives for a variety of practical reasons related to how RF systems work as well as data management.  Yes, science fiction tends to become reality sooner or later, but in today's terms, these attacks are targeting high-value political targets, not the average SR vendor or buyer.  If LE does come sniffing around eventually, your OPSEC, situational awareness, and contingency planning are going to play a far bigger role in your survival than what you painted your house with: [clearnet] http://www.emfields.org/shielding/paint.asp  People tend to view RF as a scary black box.  It's definitely getting scarier as our tech gets more mobile and personal.  But at the end of the day careful planning is still the most important element to ensuring your safety and liberty.","QuoteSuch systems simulate a GSM base station to attract GSM phones away from the regular GSM network and to log them into the systemâs virtual base station instead.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","El Presidente","20291","2014-01-27T22:11:58","RF location tracking","Discussion/Security"," It is widely used technique, probably more so today in fact that a few years ago despite the LI capabilities of UMTS & LTE.  Here is some descriptive text taken from a German manufacturer of IMSI/IMEI capture devices to LE:   We mentioned on another thread that it is possible to use a uni-directional high gain antenna to only camp onto a single ARFCN in a manner which prevents other neighbor cells from seeing you. This sounds similar to the effect you describe of driving to a distant rural area. This limits location sensing (excluding 3G and above phones) to a cell tower location, a bearing (typically around +/- 30 degrees) and an approximate distance +/- 500m. Unless you are careful CCTV or similar may offer undesirable correlation.   So there are a few techniques in play here.  1) Active internal attack - the technique of implanting a circuit with a relatively strong electromagnetic field and emissions that are modulated by near-by circuits and carriers. These can have the effect of capturing local signals and transmitting them outside of the device in which they are implanted.  2) Active external attack - the technique of causing otherwise non-emitting circuitry to emanate recoverable data as above but this time by causing it to resonate by hitting it externally with high power radio transmissions, typically in the microwave range. This can potentially be used to extract data from nearby processing equipment.  3) Passive leakage - as per issue 1 but no external radio sources are required. This type of signal leakage is inadvertent and is related to emitters within a circuit board and/or poor shielding. Often picked up during FCC testing especially where signals are sub 3ghz.  Rules  1) Never run a strong transmitter anywhere near electronic equipment processing sensitive information (phones, access points, PMR/CB, microwave ovens etc.) 2) Do not run power cables next to signal cables. 3) Use ferrite beads or chokes on all signal cables, apply them close to the signal source end of the cable. 4) Physically inspect hardware although unless you know what the hardware should look like this may be a waste of time.

(different from the side-channel, 'Acoustic Cryptanalysis' attack recently disscussed in various threads which listens to the sounds a computer's CPU naturally emits to snatch data, keys, ect from afar), it's another 'proof-of-concept' attack, based upon 'badBIOS', proving that even air-gapped computers can communicate/be attacked, by transmiting (both sending and receiving data) such as keystrokes, passwords, even ->GPG keys<-, via high-frequency sound waves using a computers speakers and microphone alone, from at least 65 ft away. the NSA claim they are able to do so from 8 miles away. back in 2008. and i believe them. regardless, they also commonly use other means to 'relay' signals in order to travel greater distances, f.x., via another network or cellphone nearby. one reason i never have a cell phone around when up to no good. and this still being just one of many other reasons my air-gapped (and some of my 'non-airgapped' machines as well) have the mic, cam, and speakers removed on top of bluetoofth and wi-fi, ect.. to quote from the article:-------------------""Transmitting data via sound waves has one glaring drawback, however: Itâs slow. Terribly slow. Hanspach and Goetzâs malware topped out at a sluggish 20 bits-per-second transfer rate, but that was still fast enough to transmit keystrokes, passwords, PGP encryption keys, and other small bursts of information.""âWe use the keylogging software logkeys for our experiment,â they wrote. âThe infected victim sends all recorded keystrokes to the covert acoustical mesh network. Infected drones forward the keystroke information inside the covert network till the attacker is reached, who is now able to read the current keyboard input of the infected victim from a distant place.âIn another test, the researchers used sound waves to send keystroke information to a network-connected computer, which then sent the information to the âattackerâ via email.""------------""Researchers create malware that communicates via silent sound, no network needed""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2068525/researchers-create-malware-that-communicates-via-sound-no-network-needed.htmlwhich is why, as i asked in another thread, if anyone here knew of any other small resistors, chips, micro-antennas, ect, on a computers motherboard that are capable of sending or recieving 'any' type of signal (besides wi-fi, bluetooth, mic and speakers?). that could tell us alot about other possible attack surfaces built into the hardware we ALL use. even (theoretically) perhaps when powered down (in combination with a comp's CMOS battery)? anybody know? or are those 4 the only devices/methods built into most computers that are capable of transmitting or recieveing 'any' sort of signal? either way....c0loR m3 kr@Zy now, lol... peacemirage;We also demonstrated something with far greater range - although it was a technique that lacked the ability for a standard PC to respond (or specifically to listen) - it was however suitable for long range exfiltration of data - consider this :It is possible to generate a (radio) carrier signal by pushing data through buses on the motherboard or on attached expansion cards and if one chooses the appropriate speed and frequency then it is possible to modulate a recoverable signal. Most workstations and that includes laptops are perfectly capable of transmitting a ~1MHz signal hundreds of meters dependent on the receiving party. A straight forward way to do this is to drive the video card at:a) A specific video clock rate; andb) using a specific raster pattern which can be varied in order to modulate the carrier.If you are interested in seeing this and have access to a standard AM radio then build the code on the below link and you too can listen to MP3's on the radio streamed from your PC via radio interference generated by your video card. This demo is 12 years old....Clearnet: http://www.erikyyy.de/tempest/There are similar techniques for generating TV signals (including DAB) with a video card and receiving them on TV tuners.You can apply this technique to many components and peripherals. Whilst all commercial components undergo extensive RFI testing this does not account for scenarios where one is intentionally trying to resonate PCB traces or peripheral cables.And yes, speakers can act as microphones albeit rather shit ones. Try plugging your headphones into a mic socket and turn up the gain.The reference to LED's leaking recoverable information, yes that has been researched quite extensively too. A similar technique is employed by certain agencies - 'blue light tempest' as it is sometimes known. You will not find much written about that yet if anything - maybe in a few years. Recovery of screen contents using optical/high frequency visible light reflected from walls - has to be seen to be believed."

I've been around the streets for a minute now, and it seems like any random dealer or ""friend of a friend"" I've purchased these sort of substances have either been severely underweight, or cut so much thats you can hardly tell what it was originally supposed to be. It's not like you can go back and say ""hey, I want the rest of what you owe me/that was cut so much I want my money back"", You'll get your shit beat into the ground or shot. There is no repercussion to these type of dealers nor are they concerned with what you think of their product, it's all about the bottom line and that $80 they got from you for that $20 worth of actual product in that bag. At least on the road and darknet in general, as others have said, you can leave or read feedback, reviews, and research the reputation of the vendor before you make your purchase. You know exactly what you'll be getting and if you purchase from some vendors, you even get a bit over what you actuallypaid for, not to cite how good the prices usually are. As Jaba said earlier, picking out the raids and undercovers is nearly impossible now; making SR and other markets like it irreplaceable when it comes to security and anonyminity. I've bene involved in a few raids, thankfully none of which have been at my spots, but nevertheless it's still nothing you want to ever experience.

DarkNets vs Real Life?","Discussion/Legal","There are a number of real-life contexts to this kind of activity depending on the substance and the buyer. Some people buy party type things in clubs or at concerts - usually word of mouth determines who has the best goodies and because consumption is usually immediate, it is generally obvious pretty quick whether or not you've been ripped off.  If you have a habit and are using on a daily basis, you will generally have a handful of direct sources (like having a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C) and if all of them are out of action you can generally find a source through a friend, contact or even another random user.  Worst case scenario you would be forced to trust a total stranger - who in many cases will sell underweight, heavily adulterated or totally bogus goods. And unlike this kind of transaction on a market with escrow, you have no recourse, no feedback, no nothing.  This is one of the reasons I find it ludicrous and extremely annoying when I see some noob idiot giving a vendor a 4 out of 5 rating ""because the product was 10mg underweight"" ...   Fuck, that kind of bullshit really pisses me off.  Makes me wanna slap the fucker into the middle of next week and yell: You stupid noob kid, you should be thankful that you are able to buy anything at all, especially in so secure and anonymous a manner!!!  If you have ever seen the risks of street life up close, been in the middle of a raid, or watched undercover police in action - and I swear to god, you would never, ever be able to pick them nowadays - you would stick to the darknet for sure.  Online transactions are not terribly practical if you have a big habit however, since as a rule, most addicts do not have disposable income or time in sufficient quantity to permit an exclusively online source, since when you're ""sick"" you gotta do your thing as soon as possible ...   Nevertheless, for weekend warriors and the recreational/experimental type user, I imagine it would be entirely feasible to source all your product online.   Those who have only known the darknet experience are unbelievably lucky, but by the same token, would probably have ridiculously unrealistic expectations and get the shit beaten out of them if they ever had to face doing this kind of thing in real life on the street and tried to pull some of the bullshit I see clueless fuckers writing in feedback.",""

It's telling you that when it tries to do this, the connection is actively refused.  That means there's an entity there and that's answering Firefox (but the answer is ""fuck off,"" basically).  It sounds like your firewall settings are screwing it up.  Why that's the case when the old one works I can't tell you, who knows what they changed or why, but that's my best guess.  Basically, if the Tor Browser bundle is configured to use the correct port (which I must assume it is), AND the Tor program is running (which I must assume it is, given that Vidalia is certainly reporting the status of *something*), the only answer is that some other third party entity like a firewall is throwing its weight around and blocking you.  Edit: I just re-read your problem.  You screwed up the ports.  Re-download the bundle, unzip it to a new location, and do not change the control port settings.  What you did apparently broke it because you didn't realize the difference between what a control port and the SOCKS port are.  The control port is what Vidalia connects to in order to control the Tor program (they're technically two independent programs, but Tor allows a controller to control it via that control port).  The SOCKS port that Firefox should be connecting to is different.  They must each have their proper settings.  FYI, the proper port for Firefox (the Tor browser) is 9150.  I don't recall the control port off hand, but I think it's 9151.  Or 9051.  Whatever.  Vidalia is the only thing that should be connecting to that port anyway though, so you shouldn't need to know it.","I tried and failed again but I copied the page I get in case that helps you.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Pillow","6047","2013-12-04T11:54:44","Article: ""Bitcoins: The second biggest Ponzi scheme in history""","Discussion/Security","  From clearnet  ***************http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/why-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme/******************     BY GARY NORTH  I hereby make a prediction: Bitcoins will go down in history as the most spectacular private Ponzi scheme in history. It will dwarf anything dreamed of by Bernard Madoff. (It will never rival Social Security, however.)  To explain my position, I must do two things. First, I will describe the economics of every Ponzi scheme. Second, I will explain the Austrian school of economics' theory of the origin of money. My analysis is strictly economic. As far as I know, it is a legal schemeâand should be. Ponzi economics  First, someone who no one has ever heard of before announces that he has discovered a way to make money. In the case of Bitcoin, the claim is literal. The creator literally made what he says is money, or will be money. He made this money out of digits. He made it out of nothing. Think ""Federal Reserve wanna-be.""  Second, the individual claims that a particular market provides unexploited arbitrage opportunities. Something is selling too low. If you buy into the program now, the person running the scheme will be able to sell it high on your behalf. So, you will take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.  Today, with high-speed trading, arbitrage opportunities last only for a few milliseconds seconds in widely traded markets. Arbitrage opportunities in the commodity futures market last for very short periods. But in the most leveraged and sophisticated of all the futures markets, namely, the currency futures markets, arbitrage opportunities last for so brief a period of time that only high-speed computer programs can take advantage of them.  The individual who sells the Ponzi scheme makes money by siphoning off a large share of the money coming in. In other words, he does not make the investment. But bitcoins are unique. The money was siphoned off from the beginning. Somebody owned a good percentage of the original digits. Then, by telling his story, this individual created demand for all of the digits. The dollar-value of his share of the bitcoins appreciates with the other digits.  This strategy was described a generation ago by George Goodman, who wrote under the pseudonym of Adam Smith. You can find it in his book, Supermoney. This is done with financial corporations when individuals create a new business, retain a large share of the shares, and then sell the stock to the public. In this sense, Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. It is simply a supermoney scheme.  The Ponzi aspect of it comes when we look at the justification for bitcoins. They were sold on the basis that bitcoins will be an alternative currency. In other words, this will be the money of the future.  The coins will never be the money of the future.  The Austrian school's theory of money's origins   The best definition of money was first offered by Austrian economist Carl Menger in 1892. He said that money is the most marketable commodity. This definition was picked up by his disciple, Ludwig von Mises, who presented it in his book, The Theory of Money and Credit, published in 1912.  In that book, Mises argued, as Menger had before him, that money arises out of market transactions. That which did not function as money before, now functions as money. Something that was valuable for its own sake, most likely gold or silver, becomes valuable for another purpose, namely, the facilitation of exchange. People move from barter to a monetary economy. This increases the division of labor. As more and more people use the money commodity in order to facilitate exchanges, the division of labor extends, and as a result, people's productivity increases. They can specialize. This specialization produces increased output per person, and therefore increased income per person.  In this scenario, something that had independent value becomes the focus of traders, who find that their ability to buy and sell increases as a result of the use of this commodity. Money develops out of market exchanges. Money was not used for its own sake initially, but it becomes widely used as money as a result of innumerable transactions within the economy. (I discuss this in my chapter in Theory of Money and Fiduciary Media, published by the Mises Institute in 2012.)  Here is the central fact of money. Money is the product of the market process. It arises out of an unplanned, decentralized process. This takes time. It takes a lot of time. It spreads slowly, as new people discover it as a tool of production, because it increases the size of the market for all goods and services. No one says, ""I think I'll invent a new form of money.""  Note: any time you see a proposal of a new form of money, hold on to your old form of money.  The central benefit of money is its predictable purchasing power. A monetary commodity is not easy to produce. The cost of mining is high. Money is slowly adopted by a large number of participants. These participants use money as a means of exchange. Why? Because it was valuable the day before. They therefore expect it to be valuable the next day. Money has continuity of value. This is not intrinsic value. It is historic value. So, a person can buy money by the sale of goods or services, set this money aside, and re-enter the markets in a different location or in a different time, in the confidence that he will probably be able to buy a similar quantity of goods and services.  Money is not accumulated for its own sake. It is accumulated to buy future goods and services. It is useful in the facilitation of exchange precisely because its market value varies little over time. It is the predictability of money's market exchange rate that makes it money. Bitcoins are not money  Now let us look at bitcoins. The market value of one bitcoin has gone from about $2 to $1,000 in a year. This is not money. This commodity is not being bought for its services as money. It is unpredictable to a fault.  Admittedly, those who got in early on this Ponzi scheme are doing very well. They will probably continue to do well for a time. As more people hear about this investment, which is justified in terms of its future potential as money, more people will buy it. Late-comers are not buying it because they understand its potential as future money, any more than the late investors in Charles Ponzi's scheme thought they were buying into the arbitrage potential of foreign postage stamps. They are buying bitcoins because we are in the midst of a Ponzi scheme mania. They will continue to buy because they think this time it's different.  This digital so-called money will not be used to facilitate exchange. Nobody is going to be getting rid of an asset that has moved from $2 to $1,000 in one year in order to buy pizzas. People want to hang onto it, refusing to sell, in the hopes that it will go to $2,000. This is the classic mark of Ponzi scheme psychology. People do not buy the investment for the benefits that the investment provides as an investment, in other words, because it is a capital asset. They buy it only because it has gone up in price. They expect this to continue.  Here is the Austrian school's theory of money. People buy money because it has not fallen in price. But it has also not gone up in price much, either. It is predictable. Why? Because it is held in reserve by a large number of people over a large geographical area. It has become money through tradition, through experience, and through endless numbers of exchanges on a voluntary basis. It has proven itself in the marketplace as a means of facilitating exchange, and thereby as a means of preserving value over time. This is not the characteristic feature of a Bitcoin. People are not buying it to serve as money; they are buying it because they are in the midst of a mania, and they are gambling that the number of buyers will continue upward forever.  Here is an economic fact: the number of fools is limited. They are a scarce economic resource. As the price of bitcoins rises, more fools will be lured into the market. But this is a finite market.  In other words, bitcoins cannot possibly fulfill their supposed purpose: to serve as an unregulated currency unit. Bitcoins are not an alternative currency. They are something you buy in the midst of a mania, and you will sell at some point in order to get back your money. You are thinking of buying bitcoins, not because bitcoins will serve as a means of exchange, as originally argued, but because you want to get back lots more money than you paid for them. In other words, bitcoins are not money; dollars are money. There has been no challenge from bitcoins to the reign of the dollar. Just say no  When you see an offer of an investment which inherently cannot possibly exist on its own merit, and yet lots of people are coming into the market to buy the item, you know, without any question, that this is a Ponzi scheme. People are buying into the program, not because of an arbitrage opportunity, and not because of a capital breakthrough in terms of technology, but because somebody else bought it cheaper yesterday. You buy it today, not because you think it is going to offer a stable value, but because you think you're going to make a bundle of money when more people come into the market. Again, this is the classic mark of a Ponzi scheme.  In order for bitcoins to become an alternative currency, there will have to be millions of users of the currency. There will have to be tens of millions of users of the currency. They will have to develop in a market on their merit as money, not as an investment of dollars in order to get more dollars back. It would have to develop through exchange, not bought as an investment. In other words, the free market will have to adopt bitcoins as a means of increasing the division of labor.  Bitcoins are not increasing the division of labor. They are bought on the basis that somebody can get into a game of musical chairs. Instead of running out of chairs, leaving one person the great winter, the promoters started with a given number of chairs, and then they hoped that lots would come and bid on the chairs. ""If we issue it, they will come."" This took place. The promoters creators are now very rich, as measured in dollars.  The fact of the matter is this: Bitcoins will not increase the division of labor by serving as an alternative currency. Inherently, bitcoins have made their mark, not on the basis of their stable value in exchange, that is, their value in increasing the division of labor in alternative markets that do not use the dollar. On the contrary, bitcoins are being purchased for one reason only: to get in on the deal. Buy low; sell high. Buy with what? Dollars. Sell for what? Dollars.  The mania has destroyed bitcoins' use as money. Bitcoins are too volatile in price ever to serve as a currency.  Which is money: dollars or bitcoins? The answer is obvious: dollars.  This is a Ponzi scheme. What goes up comes down  This will lead to the ruination of more people than any private Ponzi scheme in history. There will be the poor schnooks to get in at the end, paying perhaps thousands of dollars per bitcoin. Then the market will unravel. It will unravel for the same reason that all Ponzi schemes have unraveled: not enough new buyers. When the new buyers do not show up in great numbers, the holders will start to dump them. What went up in price, as measured in dollars, the real money, will come down in price.  This mania is going to be the stuff of best-selling books. This is going to be this stuff of Ph.D. dissertations in economics and psychology. This is going to be the equivalent of Mackay's book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.  The interesting thing is the mania started among the most technologically sophisticated people on earth: computer techies. The techies who got in early are going to be fabulously wealthy... if they sell. But the poor schnooks who come in at the and are going to lose money. Collectively, this will be the greatest single scheme for lots of people losing money that we have ever seen. This Ponzi scheme is not illegal... yet. It will spread. It has gone viral.  Any time you buy an investment, you had better have an exit strategy. There is no exit strategy for bitcoins.  You must get out at the top, or you lose your shirt. Conclusion  Anytime that anybody tries to sell you an investment, you have to look at it on this basis: ""What are the future benefits that this investment will give final consumers?"" In other words, how does it serve the final consumer? If it does not serve the final consumer, then it is a Ponzi scheme.  Bitcoins cannot serve the consumer. There is nothing to consume. The only way that bitcoins can work to the advantage of the consumer is that they provides the consumer with increased opportunities, based on bitcoins' function as money. But the fundamental characteristic of money is its relatively stable purchasing power.  Bitcoins will never achieve this. It is a mania going up. It will be a mania coming down. It will not increase the division of labor, because people will recognize it as having been a Ponzi scheme, and they will not again buy it. They will not use it in exchange. Companies will not sell goods and services based on bitcoins. Bitcoins have to have stable purchasing power if they are to serve as money, and they will never, ever achieve stable purchasing power.  Whenever somebody tries to sell you an investment that is based on the economic analysis of a marketâan analysis that cannot possibly be trueâdo not buy the investment. This is a simple rule. I adhere to this rule.  There has to be an economic justification for a capital investment, and there is no economic justification of buying bitcoins as an alternative currency. That was how bitcoins were initially sold, and it was impossible as an economic concept from the beginning. The Austrian theory of money shows why.  I do not invest in capital that has no economic justification other than the greater fool theory. There are too few fools to keep the scheme going.  Bitcoins are not illegal. They should not be made illegal. They should merely be avoided.  Gary North is an American economic historian.

BTW, if I buy from a localbitcoin vendor at 700 per BTC to spend in Agora, there wouldn't be a large descrpency of the value of my BTC in the Agora market (since as I mentioned its currently set at 620 per BTC, only 80 lower than what can be purchased on localbitcoins), but should I be concerned that Agora may devalue the rate at which USD is pegged to each BTC at due to the fact that the mt. gox ""market"" rate is currenly at 280 per BTC, or should I be safe? Thanks for the assistance.","Quote from: Porsche_918 on February 16, 2014, 02:48:08 amI usually buy my BTC off localbitcoins, but the cheapest asking price I could see in my area is 700 per BTC, even though the current trading price of BTC is only ~380. So if I wanted to buy something for 50 bucks on the darknet, I would have to deposit almost 100 dollars to a localbitcoins seller. I have heard of bitquick.co and coinbase.com, but was told that they are not a very safe/secure method of buying BTC, especially compared to localbitcoins. So if anyone could give any recomendations, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!You are looking at the wrong price.   They have the correct price.  No one is going to sell you something @ no or little profit, especially on local bitcoins.   To find what you want you want to find someone with coins who are looking to get rid of them even at a loss.   That's pretty hard unless you are in the market to buy $50,000 worth of bitcoins."

Gox, the Agora market has the value of BTC pinned to around 620-630. So if you are using the bitcoins you buy to get items from Agora, you won't loose a lot of value (around 10% loss). But I would recommend that you only buy enough BTC to cover what you want to order from Agora or wherever, and nothing more. The next time you want to buy, just get the BTCs to cover that purchase as well. This will hopefully limit any possible losses.","Quote from: Porsche_918 on February 16, 2014, 02:48:08 amI usually buy my BTC off localbitcoins, but the cheapest asking price I could see in my area is 700 per BTC, even though the current trading price of BTC is only ~380.

In order to send a message you need to do computational work. Everyone gets a copy of every message ever sent too, you just can't read them all.This design decision is objectively horrible. If you have a cluster or even a CUDA Enabled Graphics card, you have more message sending capacity, you can spam and the rest of the network cannot keep up and basically will eventually only be sending your messages.

It's not like they'd tip you off if they were about to bust you. Plus, the vendor can always track the package.  Could be a complete misunderstanding, but it's definitely nothing to fear.    Edit: You need to go resolve that before it gets returned to sender for no valid address. If it does, you know it's going to go to a fake address without the hope of the vendor being able to retrieve it.

Every smartphone or other device with mobile communications capability (e.g. 3G or LTE) actually runs not one, but two operating systems. Aside from the operating system that we as end-users see (Android, iOS, PalmOS), it also runs a small operating system that manages everything related to radio. Since this functionality is highly timing-dependent, a real-time operating system is required.This operating system is stored in firmware, and runs on the baseband processor. As far as I know, this baseband RTOS is always entirely proprietary. For instance, the RTOS inside Qualcomm baseband processors (in this specific case, the MSM6280) is called AMSS, built upon their own proprietary REX kernel, and is made up of 69 concurrent tasks, handling everything from USB to GPS. It runs on an ARMv5 processor.The problem here is clear: these baseband processors and the proprietary, closed software they run are poorly understood, as there's no proper peer review. This is actually kind of weird, considering just how important these little bits of software are to the functioning of a modern communication device. You may think these baseband RTOS' are safe and secure, but that's not exactly the case. You may have the most secure mobile operating system in the world, but you're still running a second operating system that is poorly understood, poorly documented, proprietary, and all you have to go on are Qualcomm's Infineon's, and others' blue eyes.The insecurity of baseband software is not by error; it's by design. The standards that govern how these baseband processors and radios work were designed in the '80s, ending up with a complicated codebase written in the '90s - complete with a '90s attitude towards security. For instance, there is barely any exploit mitigation, so exploits are free to run amok. What makes it even worse, is that every baseband processor inherently trusts whatever data it receives from a base station (e.g. in a cell tower). Nothing is checked, everything is automatically trusted. Lastly, the baseband processor is usually the master processor, whereas the application processor (which runs the mobile operating system) is the slave.So, we have a complete operating system, running on an ARM processor, without any exploit mitigation (or only very little of it), which automatically trusts every instruction, piece of code, or data it receives from the base station you're connected to. What could possibly go wrong?With this in mind, security researcher Ralf-Philipp Weinmann of the University of Luxembourg set out to reverse engineer the baseband processor software of both Qualcomm and Infineon, and he easily spotted loads and loads of bugs, scattered all over the place, each and every one of which could lead to exploits - crashing the device, and even allowing the attacker to remotely execute code. Remember: all over the air. One of the exploits he found required nothing more but a 73 byte message to get remote code execution. Over the air.You can do some crazy things with these exploits. For instance, you can turn on auto-answer, using the Hayes command set. This is a command language for modems designed in 1981, and it still works on modern baseband processors found in smartphones today (!). The auto-answer can be made silent and invisible, too.While we can sort-of assume that the base stations in cell towers operated by large carriers are ""safe"", the fact of the matter is that base stations are becoming a lot cheaper, and are being sold on eBay - and there are even open source base station software packages. Such base stations can be used to target phones. Put a compromised base station in a crowded area - or even a financial district or some other sensitive area - and you can remotely turn on microphones, cameras, place rootkits, place calls/send SMS messages to expensive numbers, and so on. Yes, you can even brick phones permanently.This is a pretty serious issue, but one that you rarely hear about. This is such low-level, complex software that I would guess very few people in the world actually understand everything that's going on here.That complexity is exactly one of the reasons why it's not easy to write your own baseband implementation. The list of standards that describe just GSM is unimaginably long - and that's only GSM. Now you need to add UMTS, HSDPA, and so on, and so forth. And, of course, everything is covered by a ridiculously complex set of patents. To top it all off, communication authorities require baseband software to be certified.Add all this up, and it's easy to see why every cellphone manufacturer just opts for an off-the-shelf baseband processor and associated software. This does mean that each and every feature and smartphone has a piece of software that always runs (when the device is on), but that is essentially a black box. Whenever someone does dive into baseband software, many bugs and issues are found, which raises the question just how long this rather dubious situation can continue.It's kind of a sobering thought that mobile communications, the cornerstone of the modern world in both developed and developing regions, pivots around software that is of dubious quality, poorly understood, entirely proprietary, and wholly insecure by design.

Some of the most serious exploitable vulnerabilities that exist in mobile phones today exist in the baseband and this has always been the case. Also the majority of these issues are not disclosed and are difficult to exploit unless you attack from the air interface which is only possible if you:  1) Are the network operator (or able to influence the network operator) 2) Run a fake base station  Until there is a viable open-source baseband (which is practically impossible due to the licensing and use of ETSI GSM/UMTS standards) then we must accept that all commercial phones can be readily exploited by network operators to force the handset to disclose its location, stream audio from the microphone and potentially interact with non-baseband elements of the phones OS.  Our German friends at Osmocom have made more progress than anyone else we know to open up the baseband and currently they make available an open-source baseband but you are stuck with 10 year old phones.

When using Tails, is it safe to consider yourself anonymous assuming you've probably configured it? On a similar note, is it safe to consider yourself anonymous when using the TorBrowser with all Javascript disabled? Why or why not? If no, what further steps need to be taken to be truly anonymous? I'm aware than TorBrowser leaves lots of signs in your registry that you've been using Tor, but does that compromise your network anonymity, or only the fact that someone who has access to your computer can see you've been on Tor?  2. Does anybody here use Whonix? It seems kind of similar to Tails in it's goals, but I don't see it mentioned here nearly as much. Does using Whonix alone allow you to be truly anonymous?  3. Should you use a VPN along with Tor?

Tor is good at not letting the sites you visit know where you are physically located, but that is about it.  Tails, on the other hand, attempts to keep your workstation clean of fingerprints in the process.  You can shoot yourself in the foot with all of these tools though.  Tor or tails do nothing to prevent someone from sniffing your network transmissions or prevent keyloggers (hence their recommendation to use a virtual keyboard).  As you said, it can be know that you are using Tor, so if you are some isolated dweeb using Tor over an insecure WiFi, theoretically someone could come park out by your house and start trying to find out what your doing.  I use Whonix, simply because it was the first thing I found and Tails isn't compatible with my hardware (even writing that is exposing some of my identity!)  I like it, except I would prefer it was also live.   I wonder if you can run the Whonix VMs inside of Tails... Edit:  I guess there is nothing stopping me from running Whonix from a Live linux distro...!  I feel like your best bet is to encrypt everything identifying, only keep passwords in your brain, and go through Tor, preferably with Tails or Whonix, keeping scripts disabled.  If you do all that and are careful, your almost bulletproof.  There are hundreds of more things you could do, but most of the time human error is the real issue, not the tech.

Developers of the FreeBSD operating system will continue preventing users from trusting processors manufactured by Intel and Via Technologies as the sole source of random numbers needed to generate cryptographic keys that can't easily be cracked by government spies and other adversaries.  That decision, which will be effective in the upcoming FreeBSD version 10.0, comes three months after secret documents leaked by former National Security Agency (NSA) subcontractor Edward Snowden said the US spy agency was able to decode vast swaths of the Internet's encrypted traffic. Among other ways, The New York Times, Pro Publica, and The Guardian reported in September, the NSA and its British counterpart defeat encryption technologies by working with chipmakers to insert backdoors, or cryptographic weaknesses, in their products.  The revelations are playing a role in the decision for FreeBSD to continue restricting the use of hardware-based random number generators to seed the data used to ensure cryptographic systems can't be easily broken by adversaries. Specifically, ""RDRAND"" and ""Padlock""âRNGs provided by Intel and Via respectivelyâwill not be the sources FreeBSD uses to directly feed random numbers into the /dev/random engine used to generate random data in Unix-based operating systems. Insteadâand has been the case for most of FreeBSD's historyâit will be possible to use the pseudo random output of RDRAND and Padlock to seed /dev/random only after it has passed through a separate RNG algorithm known as ""Yarrow."" Yarrow, in turn, will add further entropy to the data to ensure intentional backdoors, or unpatched weaknesses, in the hardware generators can't be used by adversaries to predict their output.  ""For 10, we are going to backtrack and remove RDRAND and Padlock backends and feed them into Yarrow instead of delivering their output directly to /dev/random,"" FreeBSD developers said in meeting minutes from earlier this year. ""It will still be possible to access hardware random number generators, that is, RDRAND, Padlock etc., directly by inline assembly or by using OpenSSL from userland, if required, but we cannot trust them any more.""  In separate meeting minutes, developers specifically invoked Snowden's name when discussing the decision.  ""Edward Snowdon [sic] -- v. high probability of backdoors in some (HW) RNGs,"" the notes read, referring to hardware RNGs. Then, alluding to the Dual EC_DRBG RNG forged by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and said to contain an NSA-engineered backdoor, the notes read: ""Including elliptic curve generator included in NIST. rdrand in ivbridge not implemented by Intel... Cannot trust HW RNGs to provide good entropy directly. (rdrand implemented in microcode. Intel will add opcode to go directly to HW.) This means partial revert of some work on rdrand and padlock.""  The meetings came shortly after a FreeBSD patch a third party submitted in July gave users the ability to use RDRAND and Padlock as direct sources of randomness. The update was committed without proper review and against established policy, and over the next few weeks all or parts of it were removed and recommitted FreeBSD Security Officer Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav told Ars. The change was finally removed altogether in October. Aside from the brief span earlier this year, no FreeBSD release has ever shipped with the option to feed the bit stream from a hardware pseudo-random number generator directly to /dev/random, SmÃ¸rgrav said.  SmÃ¸rgrav went on to say that some corporate users have long expressed a wish that FreeBSD allow them to run raw feeds from RDRAND, because its underlying algorithm is listed as an approved deterministic RNG under the FIPS 140 standard defense contractors and other government workers are required to follow. Using a few lines of code, FreeBSD users can to use RDRAND directly in userland rather than use the kernel to feed it to them directly.  ""What it boils down to is that we will not stand in the way of FreeBSD users who want to use these HWRNGs, but neither will we endorse them, and we felt that providing a kernel interface would amount to implicit endorsement of the underlying hardware,"" SmÃ¸rgrav wrote in an e-mail.  RNGs are one of the most important ingredients in any secure cryptographic system. They are akin to the dice shakers used in board games that ensure the full range of randomness is contained in each roll. If adversaries can reduce the amount of entropy an RNG produces or devise a way to predict some of its output, they can frequently devise ways to crack the keys needed to decrypt an otherwise unreadable message. A weakness in the /dev/random engine found in Google's Android operating system, for instance, was the root cause of a critical exploit that recently allowed thieves to pilfer bitcoins out of a user's digital wallet. RDRAND is the source of random data provided by Ivy Bridge and later versions of Intel processors. Padlock seeds random data in chips made by Via.  While the FreeBSD developers discussing their distrust cited allegations of backdoors raised in documents leaked by Snowden, the move is a good idea even if those weaknesses never came to light. Adding additional sources of randomness to RDRAND, Padlock, and other RNGs will not reduce their entropy and may make the keys they help generate harder to crack. Relying on multiple sources of randomness is a good practice and possibly could have helped prevent recently discovered crippling weaknesses in Taiwan's secure digital ID system.",""

The smallest demographic lending support to this question is Republicans, who still show over 30% support for outright legalization.   Over 80% of Floridians support the proposed ballot initiative which would legalize cannabis for medical use. The ballot initiative has gotten all the signatures required (and then some), but they need to be verified and certified. There is a challenge to the language being brought before the State Supreme Court.   If it gets on the ballot, it will pass with no problems. The problem right now is whether or not it can get on the ballot with its current language. The opposition claims it would be the most laxed medical cannabis law given there is a clause for conditions that states (paraphrasing) ""any condition a physician deems treatable."" That would, basically, make Florida's MMJ law look more like California's than any other state.   It is also important to remember Florida is a pain management state. 80% of opiates prescribed in the US are prescribed in Florida. The state has the most laxed prescription opiate and pain management clinic laws- pain management clinics in other states, for example, have equipment used to diagnose and treat the underlying causes of pain... in Florida, pain management clinics consist of a doctor's visit, and a prescription. Many of Florida's Medicare/Medicaid/elderly/social security recipient/disability population are growing tired of prescription opiates, and their effects on quality of life, and are realizing medical cannabis is a much more effective alternative.

It's an important case, given that more than 90 percent of American adults now own a cell phone and 58 percent have a smart phone.  And more than 12 million people are arrested in the U.S. each year, most of them for minor offenses, such as drunk driving or getting in fights.  Police also have authority to make arrests for fine-only infractions like driving without a seat belt, littering, or jaywalking.  So, allowing police to search the text, photo, and video files on all of those smart phones would severely compromise personal privacy, says Jeffrey Fisher of Stanford Law School.  ""Such files hold exponentially greater amounts and types of sensitive personal information than any physical item"" an arrested person could carry.  While the Constitution ordinarily requires police to get a search warrant before looking at someone's personal possessions, the courts have granted an exception when a person is taken into custody.  The U.S. Justice Department and the State of California argue that's justification enough for looking at the contents of a smart phone.  ""Computer search and seizure is the new frontier. These are the first cases of many that the Supreme Court will decide in the area, so they'll be very important for the future of the law.""  The Supreme Court will now hear two cases on the privacy issue, both involving criminal defendants who sought to have evidence taken from their phones thrown out on the grounds that the police did not first get a warrant. Lower courts came to opposite conclusions in their cases.  In one, Fisher represents David Leon Riley, who was pulled over in San Diego five years ago for driving with an expired license. When police found guns in his car, they arrested him for carrying concealed weapons.  Police then discovered pictures and videos on his Samsung smart phone which led to charges that he took part in violent gang-related crimes. His conviction was upheld.  In the second case, Massachusetts man Brima Wurie was arrested for dealing drugs. After taking him into custody, police learned where he lived by looking at a log of calls on his cell phone. At his home, they found more drugs and a gun. His conviction was overturned when the evidence from the phone was thrown out.  Lawyers for the two men argue that the courts have allowed police to search the possessions of people they arrest for two reasons â assuring officer safety and preventing the destruction of evidence. Neither interest, they say, is at stake with cell phones.  ""The digital contents of a smart phone are categorically incapable of threatening officer safety. And once police have seized and secured a smart phone, there is no risk that the arrestee might destroy or alter its digital contents,"" Fisher argued in his court brief.  His position is supported by several privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), who say that today's smart phones contain vast amounts of data that never before could have been carried around.  ""The breadth of that information would likely reveal an individual's medical history, religious beliefs, political affiliations, network of friends, colleagues, intimate associates, and acquaintances,"" read a friend-of-the-court brief filed by EFF and others.  A modern smart phone, they argue, is essentially a compact computer that happens to include a telephone and stores the kind of highly personal information that in the past could only be found by searching a home desk, bank vault, and medicine cabinet.  But the same versatility that has made phones popular among ordinary citizens has also made them a tool of criminals, the Obama administration argues.  ""It is now common for drug deals to be arranged by cell phones, for violent street gangs to communicate through text messages, and for child abuse to be recorded on camera phones,"" the Justice Department stated in its court filings. ""In today's world, cell phones are particularly likely to contain evidence of unlawful activity and to help law-enforcement officers identify suspects they have apprehended.""  The federal government and the State of California also argue that previous court decisions have upheld searches of items a suspect carries that may contain highly personal information, such as diaries, address books, wallets, briefcases, and purses. The Supreme Court is asked to decide whether cell phones merely contain more of what the police can already see without a search warrant, or whether the huge amount of data the devices hold puts them in an entirely different category.  Prof. Orin Kerr of the George Washington University College of Law, an expert in the field of police searches, noted, ""computer search and seizure is the new frontier. These are the first cases of many that the Supreme Court will decide in the area, so they'll be very important for the future of the law.""  The court is expected to decide the cases by late June.

In the UK, they can only do a raid between 6am and 6pm, Monday to Friday. I just make sure I am up at 5.00am sharp every morning and ready to begin my work by 5.45. I have a large bucket of a certain chemical beside all the drugs before I package, so that if I do see them coming I put all the drugs in there (the drugs dissolve) and pour out the window. Good luck finding something to charge me with after that LE. Unless of course I have several packages already packaged up. Okay, so they caught me with letters that contained drugs, but I never package more than 5 orders at a time before passing them on to my poster.

You could create a bootable sd card (on a usb thumb drive card reader) with a persistent linux and install truecrypt and virtualbox on it. Make sure it doesn't have a swap file. If you need to get rid of it you can break the sd card open and burn it. It's easier to destroy than a normal usb thumb drive but the life time of a thumb drive may be larger.  You could also create a script which overwrites the sd card with zeros if you don't have time to burn it. In that case a fast sd card and card reader which supports that speed would be of advantage.

However, the federal case In re Boucher may be influential as case law. In this case, a man's laptop was inspected by customs agents and child pornography was discovered. The device was seized and powered-down, at which point disk encryption technology made the evidence unavailable. The judge argued that since the content had already been seen by the customs agents, Boucher's encryption password ""adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information.""[19]In another case, a district court judge ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case: âI conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer,â Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled on January 23, 2012.[20]However, in United States v. Doe, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled on 24 February 2012 that forcing the decryption of one's laptop violates the Fifth Amendment.[21][22]The difference between the two rulings is in previous cases, the courts have held that when the government already knows of the existence of specific incriminating files, compelling a suspect to produce them does not violate the Fifth Amendment's rule against self-incrimination. On the other hand, if the government merely suspects that an encrypted hard drive contains some incriminating documents, but lacks independent evidence for the existence of specific documents, then the owner of the hard drive is entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment. In the Colorado case, the police had intercepted a telephone conversation in which the defendant, Ramona Fricosu, acknowledged her ownership of the laptop and alluded to the existence of incriminating documents in the encrypted portions of the hard drive. The government successfully argued that this precluded her from claiming Fifth Amendment protection, since she had already acknowledged the existence of incriminating documents in the case. The Tenth Circuit let that decision stand, though it may consider the issue again later in the process.In the Florida case, on the other hand, the government lacked any specific evidence about the contents of the encrypted hard drives. A forensic expert acknowledged it was theoretically possible that the drives, which were encrypted using TrueCrypt, could be completely empty. Hence, forcing the suspect to decrypt the drive would be forcing him to reveal whether any relevant documents exist, which would be inherently incriminating.;WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court says prosecutors can use a person's silence against them if it comes before he's told of his right to remain silent.The 5-4 ruling comes in the case of Genovevo Salinas, who was convicted of a 1992 murder. During police questioning, and before he was arrested or read his Miranda rights, Salinas answered some questions but did not answer when asked if a shotgun he had access to would match up with the murder weapon.Prosecutors in Texas used his silence on that question in convicting him of murder, saying it helped demonstrate his guilt. Salinas appealed, saying his Fifth Amendment rights to stay silent should have kept lawyers from using his silence against him in court. Texas courts disagreed, saying pre-Miranda silence is not protected by the Constitution.The high court upheld that decision.The Fifth Amendment protects Americans against forced self-incrimination, with the Supreme Court saying that prosecutors cannot comment on a defendant's refusal to testify at trial. The courts have expanded that right to answering questions in police custody, with police required to tell people under arrest they have a right to remain silent without it being used in court.Prosecutors argued that since Salinas was answering some questions â therefore not invoking his right to silence â and since he wasn't under arrest and wasn't compelled to speak, his silence on the incriminating question doesn't get constitutional protection.Salinas' ""Fifth Amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in response to the officer's question,"" Justice Samuel Alito said. ""It has long been settled that the privilege `generally is not self-executing' and that a witness who desires its protection `must claim it.'""The court decision was down its conservative/liberal split, with Alito's judgment joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia.Liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. ""In my view the Fifth Amendment here prohibits the prosecution from commenting on the petitioner's silence in response to police questioning,"" Breyer said in the dissent.Salinas was charged in 1993 with the previous year's shooting deaths of two men in Houston. Police found shotgun shells at the crime scene, and after going to the home where Salinas lived with his parents, obtained a shotgun kept inside the house by his father. Ballistic reports showed the shells matched the shotgun, but police declined to prosecute Salinas.Police decided to charge him after one of his friends said that he had confessed, but Salinas evaded police for years. He was arrested him in 2007, but his first trial ended in a mistrial. It was during his second trial that prosecutors aggressively tried to use his silence about the shotgun in closing remarks to the jury.Salinas was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The Texas Court of Appeals and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the conviction, with the latter court saying ""pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence is not protected by the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and that prosecutors may comment on such silence regardless of whether a defendant testifies.""The case is Salinas v. Texas, 12-246."

Multiple choices for if you fail to enter the password, ranging from: dismount all volumes clear all userspace memory and logout, erase all data in specified directories and start writing random data to disk, or even running a specified script which could do anything else.  It would be a pain in the ass though, having to type your password back in every 5 minutes. Probably so much that people would stop using it pretty quickly",""

Seems like handing over password would be essentially self-incrimination.There has been a case now where this has been tested and the right to withhold the password for the reasons stated was upheld, now judicial precedent has been set I would hope this will help define the legal situation for any future cases of this nature, hopefully anyway."

"Silk Road 2 Forums","cespo","1555","2013-10-28T11:46:09","How to run TOR -> VPN GUIDE..??","Discussion/Security","","Just connect in the order you want the services to work.So, for example, if you want Tor > VPN, then open your Tor browser and when you see the ""Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor."" then you're connected to Tor. Now, connect to your VPN the usual way. You're done.The reverse is also true. For VPN > Tor you connect to your VPN the normal way (hopefully using OpenVPN) and then you load up your Tor browser and all your Tor traffic will run through the VPN.The comment about VPN > Tor = jail isn't entirely accurate. That was printed in the opsec brief by grugq. VPN > Tor protects you from your ISP sniffing your traffic...or even knowing you're on Tor (for the most part) because you're first connecting through a VPN. All your ISP knows is that you've connected to a server in Austria (or wherever). They can't sniff your traffic. The downside is that anything you do unencrypted on clearnet can be sniffed by the exit node. If you spend all your time surfing SR and onion sites, then you don't have to worry because you never leave the hidden services and thus do not have an exit node.Tor > VPN protects you from malicious exit nodes. When you exit Tor your traffic is routed through a secure tunnel before you visit any clearnet sites so, in theory, exit node operators cannot sniff any of your traffic. The disadvantage is that your ISP knows you're connecting to Tor. The other disadvantage is you are more vulnerable to Tor exploits that try to identify your ISP. For example, in August if you were one of the people connecting to Freedom Hosting sites using Windows OS and the outdated Tor browser, the FBI javascript exploit could have pulled your real IP address if you were connected Tor > VPN. If you were connected VPN > Tor, then the FBI would have only received your VPN IP address. The FBI would have to then visit your VPN and subpoena records if they want your original ISP. In that case, hopefully you used an offshore VPN that doesn't keep records but you can't be sure they are telling the truth. But that's off-topic."

Regardless of the order in which you connect the TBB and your VPN you will always wind up with Tor over VPN.  If you want to use VPN over Tor it is not so easy. Using VPN over Tor keeps your VPN from seeing your true IP. You have to edit your VPN config files or use a service like AirVPN which provides this option automatically. Note that when you use VPN over Tor you have to use a browser which is configured NOT to use the manual proxy configuration, you just set Firefox to use system proxy settings.

It appears just about any step in the purchasing process can give you away, whether you are caught on a surveillance tape buying a money order, buying in person, or obviously buying through an exchange using a bank link.  As I understand it the only way to undo that loss of anonymity is run your coins through a bitcoin tumbling service. Using one of these is pretty straight forward.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","202","2013-10-10T07:14:25","[Intel] Knock and Talk Technique [Great Read!]","Discussion/Security","Originally posted by thyme   From Drug Interdiction: Partnership, Legal Principles, & Investigative Methodologies, 2e, G Steffan,  2012.  Quote      Law enforcement officers, specifically drug enforcement investigators, are always searching for innovative ways to combat the drug trade. Historically, drug enforcement officers have utilized traditional methods of narcotic enforcement, such as the use of informants, undercover operations, surveillance, wire intercepts, and reverse sting drug operations. Never did the drug enforcement officer imagine that merely knocking on drug dealersâ doors and asking if they would surrender drugs to police officers or allow the police to search their residences for drugs would really work. In the early part of our careers, never did we think that this would be an option, much less a reality. There is still some limited skepticism within the law enforcement community; however, most realize this technique is an extremely valuable investigative tool.      The technique, now known as a âknock and talk,â is an effective law enforcement tool, not only for drug investigations, but also in other criminal investigations. The method is a consensual encounter as described in Chapter 2. This is one type of encounter that starts with the consent of the individual. The difference is that we are going to the personâs residence or business and asking for a consent search. A consent search is one of the exceptions to a search warrant.      This technique is believed to have been created in the early 1980s and has developed today into an excellent investigative option. It is creating previously unimagined investigative opportunities. Before this technique, drug enforcement units would receive information regarding drug traffickers dealing or possessing drugs in their homes and businesses but really did not know what to do with the information. Investigators would rack their brains to think of a way to âget inâ to the residence or business to try to make a drug case. If informants were not available or surveillance either was impractical or failed to produce the desired results, that information would probably be left in a file cabinet somewhere. Intelligence information regarding drug activity was handled in that fashion before this technique.     ...     ~~What Is a âKnock and Talkâ?~~     In this chapter, we will explore a number of areas regarding this valuable investigative tool. We will define the nature of âknock and talkâ investigations and identify when it would be most advantageous to use this technique, as well as learn the steps of this process. We will emphasize the safety concerns surrounding âknock and talkâ investigations.      The term âknock and talkâ simply means what it describes: knocking on someoneâs door, talking with the occupants, asking for consent to search the premisesâthe personâs home, apartment, or business. The âknock and talkâ technique does not require probable cause or a search warrant to allow law enforcement to make contact with an individual and  ask for a consensual search of the premises. Many courts provide a definition of a consensual encounter. In the case of U.S. v. Werking, 915 F.2d. 1404, 1410, 10th Circuit (1991), the court stated that âa consensual encounter is simply the voluntary cooperation of a private  citizen in response to non-coercive questioning by a law enforcement official.â In U.S. v. Cormier, 220 F.3d. 1103, 9th Circuit (2000), the court indicated the general rule regarding âknock and talkâ encounters is that there is no rule which makes it illegal per se, or a condemned invasion of the personâs right of privacy, for anyone openly and peaceably to knock on the front door of any manâs âcastleâ with the honest intent of asking questions of the occupant. There is no evidence to indicate that was anything other than consensual and no suspicion needed to be shown in order to justify the âknock and talk.â      We know that the use of the âknock and talkâ technique raises a number of Fourth Amendment issues. The Fourth Amendment states that â[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause. ...â The U.S. Supreme Court has further stated in U.S. vs. Payton, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980), âIt is a âbasic principle of Fourth Amendment lawâ that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.â      The general rule under federal law is that the âknock and talkâ is a lawful investigative technique that does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Many state courts have taken the same position. Citing both federal and state case law, the Supreme Court of Wyoming in Gompf v. State, 120 P.3d at 986, stated that â[t]he prevailing rule is that, absent a clear expression by the owner to the contrary, police officers are permitted to approach a dwelling and seek permission to question an occupant in the course of their official business.â Federal law does not require officers to have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to knock on the door of a residence and talk to an individual.      Skeptics of this technique will say that a drug dealer is not going to let you into his home to search for drugs. That may be true under certain circumstances. However, it is absolutely astonishing how many times a drug trafficker provides consent to officers to search his premises. In many cases, the drug dealer surrenders narcotics to the officers.You never know what can happen in a âknock and talk,â but if you do not try, nothing will happen anyway. The technique calls for being assertive and trying something new. Many police officers say to us, âThat stuff wonât work in our area. They wonât let us in their houses.â We say that may be true; however, one never knows until one tries.     â¦     What typically happens with the information that law enforcement receives about a person dealing drugs? Generally, a police agency receives information via a âtipâ from an informant or other source of information that a particular individual is trafficking narcotics at their residence or business. Information may be received through a tip line, set up by the police agency to receive information about drug dealing in their community. Many police agencies take this information and act upon it. Much of the information received via a tip line is anonymous, and many of the people providing information about drug dealing prefer to remain anonymous. Information received through a tip line is often generic, something like âCars are coming to the house and leaving a short time later. I think the guy is dealing drugs because he doesnât work.â Other tips may be more specific as to what is occurring at a location, such as âThe person is dealing cocaine from his business and keeps the drugs in a safe in his office.â Historically, this information was  too generic to act upon if no other investigative avenues were available, such as an informant. Today, we can and should act upon just this information. As law enforcement we have an obligation to act upon information regarding drug dealing. Certainly, there is an element of risk involved in the decision of doing a âknock and talk.â We may get nothing at all; the person may slam the door in our face and refuse to allow us to search. At least we tried to do something and show the community that we are acting on the information. We put people on notice and advise them we are aware of their activities. Yes, the person may move from the area, and some would argue that we are just displacing crime. That may be true; however, at least we tried to act upon this very serious problem we call drug dealing.      An investigative group or analyst will do some background work on the individual, and there may or may not be information concerning their narcotics activities. At this point, depending on the police agency, the information may be provided to a detective for further follow-up investigation.      The investigator may drive by the residence or business to observe any potential activity and what vehicles are at the location. The investigator may conduct surveillance at the  location. There may or may not be any activity observed at the location that would indicate that drug trafficking could be occurring. Once all of the investigative efforts have  been exhausted and there is no active informant or other information, the investigator  may either close the investigation or try to obtain further information at a later time. The âknock and talkâ may be an option at this point.      The investigator and a partner travel to the location, knock on the door, and ask to speak with the occupants. Investigators at this point should ask consent to enter the premises to discuss some concerns regarding information they have received. Consent may be considered coerced if the investigators use some sort of âtrickeryâ or are untruthful about  their true purpose. The officers can tell the subject that they have received information concerning drug dealing, or they can be more generic about specific information. The individual is provided with an opportunity to discuss the information. The investigators either ask the individual to surrender drugs if there are any narcotics in the residence or consent to a search of the premises. The drug traffickers may surrender narcotics or the investigators may search the premises and find drugs, at which point the subject will be charged criminally. It sounds simple, but does it work? It does not always work this way, but there are numerous documented cases in which this technique has been extremely effective.      This particular method is a versatile program for all types of law enforcement cases. Criminal investigators, such as robbery investigators, homicide, and property crime detectives, can use this technique. In addition, uniform officers can use this process to obtain evidence in a particular crime. Individuals who are most successful in conducting the âknock  and talkâ are those who are most comfortable speaking with people. They are officers who  know proper procedure and are familiar with search and seizure (Fourth Amendment) in particular. The investigator should display a good presence and demeanor when making contact with individuals in the âknock and talkâ process.      Does the âknock and talkâ work? It certainly does, and the key is to gain entrance to the premises first. It is cost effective for law enforcement agencies that have limited  resources. Many agencies are not in the position or do not have the resources to place officers on long-term surveillance or extended investigative efforts. The âknock and talkâ is an effective method in dealing with situations of drug trafficking under these circumstances.      There are, of course, safety issues and concerns with this technique. The biggest concern for the officer is entering the âunknown.â It can be extremely dangerous when the officers enter a location where they are not familiar with the surroundings, do not know how many individuals are at the location, and do not know if there are weapons or firearms  present. The purpose of this technique is to verify that a subject or subjects are violating the law, then to obtain a legal consensual search of the premises. Investigators must be aware  that false and slanderous information may be provided to law enforcement for a variety of reasons. Some of those reasons include, but are not limited to, domestic situations and child custody issues. A background investigation must be completed before conducting a âknock and talkâ; it may flush out any issues such as false information.     â¦     ~~Reasons to Use a âKnock and Talkâ~~â¨     It is essential that investigators investigate information or intelligence as thoroughly as possible and use a number of investigative options. If other options ârun dry,â the âknock and talkâ is a viable alternative. ***If the investigator has no probable cause for a search warrant or arrest, and surveillance fails to produce information where probable cause can be established, the âknock and talkâ can be considered. This technique is a last resort when there are no other investigative leads and no informants who can either provide information or be able to take an active role in the investigation.***[emphasis mine --t.]      â¨Investigators should not use this technique as a âshortcutâ for their cases. If probable cause does exist for a search warrant to the premises, draft a search warrant and execute it.      â¨Some investigators use the âknock and talkâ as a shortcut when they do have other investigative options. In the case of a âknock and talk,â there are only two things that will happen: You will get into the residence or you will be refused entry. In a search warrant situation, there is no question that investigators will enter the premises and conduct a search. With the âknock and talk,â there is no guarantee.      ~~Why Do People Consent?~~â¨     There is an ongoing debate concerning policeâcitizen encounters and the consent issue. A number of court interpretations exist with respect to consent. The Fourth Amendment to  the Constitution of the United States provides individuals the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure of their persons, houses, papers, and effects. In the past several  years, policeâcitizen encounters in various venues, including public transportation areas, have dramatically increased. These voluntary searches have provided law enforcement with an additional tool to combat and prevent crime. What the courts debate and have begun to examine more closely are the conditions under which consensual encounters are  conducted, and whether a personâs consent to the police search was in fact voluntary.      â¨There are number of rational reasons why people would consent to a search by the police, and these are recognized by some courts in the United States. Certainly, there are many psychological implications with respect to what an individual believes is occurring during the consent search. Many people believe that evidence in their home will be overlooked, that the officer will not really search; they wish to appear cooperative and think that if they do not consent they will âlook guilty.â A subject may consent to a police search  thinking that if drugs are found, he can explain their presence or deny knowledge. A person may think that he simply has been caught and give up. In providing a consent search,  a person may believe that consent will make him appear not to have knowledge. The logic is, âWhy would I let you search if there were drugs in my house? It doesnât make sense.â A  subject may believe that the narcotics or contraband is so well concealed that law enforcement would never find it. This is what we call âwrapping 101.â Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) and individuals use a number of masking agents or concealment areas in a variety of locations. Whether it is in a parcel, vehicle, or home or on their person, they may feel secure enough to provide law enforcement with consent. There is much discussion between drug traffickers as to what to use to eliminate the odor of narcotics or to conceal them in a fashion such that they believe they will never be found. Traffickers may build false compartments in the walls, floors, and ceilings of their homes. Many other elaborate concealment areas have been used in homes and businesses. Law enforcement must educate prosecutors, judges, and juries concerning consent searches and how they are a viable mechanism for criminal investigations.      â¨In many instances, unfortunately, law enforcement backs away from individuals who appear to be cooperative. We call this the âlazy cop syndrome.â Many officers justify in their minds that if the subject gave them consent, maybe that person does not have anything to hide. If an individual provides the officer with consent to search, the officer should always do a thorough and complete search. If the officer went to the trouble of asking an individual to conduct a consent search, why would the officer not complete that search?      â¨A consent search is one of the exceptions to a search warrant. Other exceptions include the âplain view doctrine,â exigent circumstances, abandonment, and the âopen fields doctrine,â where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in open fields. The U.S. Supreme Court provides homeowners with a great deal of protection, and rightfully so. An abundance of case law related to consensual encounters exists. One of the premier Supreme Court decisions with respect to this issue is U.S. v. Bostick, 501 US 429 (1991). The key phrase in the Courtâs opinion with respect to a consent search is, âA reasonable person would feel free to decline the officerâs request or otherwise terminate the encounter.â This phrase is important when law enforcement deals with a consensual encounter such as a âknock and talkâ situation. A person can refuse a search of his premises at any time. The courts have said that law enforcement can conduct a constitutional search without a warrant if they receive the consent of the individual whose premises, effects, or person are to be searched.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","202","2013-10-10T07:17:06","[Intel] Knock and Talk Technique [Great Read!]","Discussion/Security","last part Quote      ~~Determination in Obtaining Consent~~â¨     The âknock and talkâ technique is no exception to a consensual encounter in determining several factors in obtaining consent. It is important to determine the âstandingâ of the person who is providing the consent before a search, while doing a âknock and talkâ in a premises or business. Can the subject give consent overall, and does he have control over  the area? Does he have access to the premises or certain portions of the premises? It is incumbent upon the investigator to determine the answers to all of these questions about who exercises control. There may be a visitor in the home who does not have access or control over any of the areas. There may be a tenant who rents a portion of the residence such as a bedroom. That person may be able to provide consent to the investigator over areas to which that person has access or control such as a mutual bathroom, kitchen area, or some living area. That person may not be able to give consent, however, to another personâs bedroom for which he does not have access. These are all determining factors in conducting a search of premises.      â¨With respect to juveniles and consent, there is no real black-and-white answer. This is a gray area with respect to case law. The same factors should apply in obtaining consent and asking who has control over the area, who has access, and does the person providing the consent go into the area to be searched. There may be a situation in which the parent is present at the residence but the juvenile is not. If the parent does not have access to the area to be searched, such as a juvenileâs bedroom which the parent indicates he never enters, the parent may not be able to provide consent to that particular room. Locked containers to which a parent does not have access may be an issue as well. The parent does not have the authority to provide you with consent to locked areas or containers, for example, in a juvenileâs bedroom. There are situations where juveniles are providing monies to their parents for rent. In this case it should be determined whether the whole room belongs to the juvenile and whether the parent has access to areas of a particular room the juvenile is occupying. The documentation of the consent must be clear and concise. The investigative report should describe the consent to be free of intimidation and coercion and unequivocal.      â¨When it is time to ask someoneâs consent to search, law enforcement officers may be reluctant to use the word âsearch.â It is important to avoid phrases such as âCan I look around?,â âCan I take a peek?,â âCan I take a quick look around?,â or âCan I just take a walk around?â There must be verbal clarity with a request to search. The courts do not want law enforcement to be vague. The officers must be clear about what they want to search and should say the word âsearch.â Consent must be defined. Some courts have taken the position that in response to a request to âtake a quick look around,â a reasonable person may not expect the search to go beyond a plain view search. A defense would be that a âquick look aroundâ did not mean an actual search, and the consent search would be contested.      â¨Consider how you knock on the door of a residence when you conduct a âknock and talk.â There is a distinction between a âpolice knockâ and a casual, normal knock. The ânormalâ knock should be described as normal in force and duration. How the officer knocked on the door may be a factor during a court hearing. The defense may claim that the knock was intimidating and put their client in a position of being fearful and anxious.      â¨There are other factors to consider with respect to contact with the person in his home. As a general rule, a command to a person almost automatically converts the encounter in someoneâs home from voluntary into a detention. Commands to a person in his home should be avoided. Some examples are phrases such as âCome over here, I want to talk with you,â âGet out of bed, I want to talk with you,â or âGet your hands out of your pockets.â Avoid using words and phrases such as âStopâ or âStay there,â and avoid asking someone to step away from a particular part of the residence. Officers run a fine line when commands such as these are given. We do want to emphasize, however, that if there is an issue of safety, commands can be appropriate. Even if the search may be lost, the goal is to make the officer safe.      â¨The investigator should avoid putting his hands on a subject; this may be construed as a detention situation, even if it is a casual hand on the shoulder while speaking to the subject. Asking someone to move from one place of the premises to another or to sit may be construed as a detention as well.      â¨Length of time of an encounter during a âknock and talkâ should be considered. Although there is no definition of the amount of time when an encounter becomes a detention, at some point that encounter may take too long. If the investigator takes a long time to obtain a consent search of the premises, the encounter may become too long.      â¨The age and intelligence of the person whose premises the investigator is asking to search should be taken into consideration. For instance, if a child is left alone in the home by the parents, the child may be in a position intellectually to provide a consent search of the areas to which they have access.  ",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Rastaman Vibration","202","2013-10-10T07:16:24","[Intel] Knock and Talk Technique [Great Read!]","Discussion/Security","part 2 Quote      ~~âKnock and Talkâ as an Investigative Technique~~â¨     Once investigators and officers have exhausted all other investigative options and decide to conduct a âknock and talk,â a number of factors should be taken into consideration with  respect to planning and execution of the technique. The investigator should have as much information as possible concerning the individuals before making contact at a premise or business to ask for a consensual search. You should know as much as possible about the criminal activity you are dealing with, and know the answers to your questions before you ask. It is absolutely essential that a background investigation be done on individuals who can be identified in the residence. Do not go into the âknock and talkâ blindly; it is dangerous. Criminal histories warrant checks and driverâs license checks and violent tendenciesâall should be explored. Patrol activity (calls for service) at the residence or business should be explored in order to establish pertinent activity.     ...     â¨Once a plan is in place, typically two investigators or officers will go to the door. There is a reason for two officers; one is for safety reasons, and the other is that one of the officers should talk as the other one scans. This is typically called the âtalkerâ and the âscanner.â The talker initially makes verbal contact with the individual, as the scanner scans for things that can âhurtâ them, such as a weapon or firearm. In addition, the scanner is looking for items in plain view, such as paraphernalia or narcotics. One officer, nor more than two, should not commence a âknock and talk.â Going to a âknock and talkâ alone is dangerous. Three or more at the door becomes a coercive and intimidating situation, and the officers may lose the search under these circumstances.      â¨If other officers are available, a plan should be in place to position them as backup at the exterior perimeter, watching for suspicious activity inside as well as outside the residence. Often in these situations, people may approach the residence to purchase drugs. Those individuals can be encountered and possibly used as witnesses.      â¨When the exterior perimeter investigators are in position, two officers should approach the door and make contact with the individual(s). Once the contact is made, the officers should identify themselves with their proper police credentials. Officers should then ask if the person has a moment to speak, and if he would allow officers to come inside. The officer should speak calmly and not be authoritative or accusatory. The object is to get inside the residence to be in a position to possibly see items in plain view. The element of surprise is a factor in a âknock and talk,â so the suspect will not have the opportunity to hide or destroy evidence or have a plan of response for the detectivesâ questioning.     ...     ~~What Happens During a âKnock and Talkâ?~~â¨     What generally happens during a âknock and talkâ? Investigators typically are able to make entry to a location most of the time. That percentage would depend on the environment and the suspectâs prior contact with law enforcement. Once inside a residence or business, a number of situations may occur.     â¨The investigators will ask and obtain consent to search the premises for narcotics. Depending on what is observed in plain view, probable cause may be established. The officers may observe narcotics or other evidence such as paraphernalia or drugs once they are inside.      â¨There may be exigent circumstances. In this case, the investigators must articulate the exigency of the circumstances and describe what was occurring. There may be a situation where the subject is attempting to destroy evidence such as narcotics. The suspect may attempt flushing narcotics down the commode.      â¨The officers may receive a refusal to search or cooperate. An individual may say that he will not submit to a consent search or will not surrender any narcotics to the investigators and requests them to leave. Under these circumstances, unless evidence is seen in plain view, there is no choice but to depart the premises.     â¨A refusal by the subject puts him on ânoticeâ that the police are aware of his activities and that they would be conducting further investigation. This may put the trafficker on edge, and the subject may move from the area. The âknock and talkâ gives the perception of the police being everywhere, and the subject may be trying to figure out how law enforcement knew that he was dealing narcotics.      â¨If the individual cooperates and provides consent to the officers to enter the premises, there are a number of options at this point. The first thing the officers should ask is if anyone else is in the residence at that time. The subject may or may not tell the investigators whether there are other individuals on the premises, but there is an option to ask the subject for his consent to conduct a cursory examination of the residence to identify any other people for their protection. If the subject consents, it is permissible for the officer to do a walk-through and examine areas in which a person may hide. This does not give the officers the authority to search areas in which a person cannot hide such as dresser drawers, medicine cabinets, and other like areas. The officers may examine areas such as a room, a closet, under a bed, and other areas where a person may hide.      â¨An officer may examine the premises for people and, for example, open a closet and find narcotics, such as bales of marijuana or a marijuana-growing operation. Under these circumstances, the officer should leave the items as they were found and go back to the subject and either secure the location for a search warrant or interview the subject further under Miranda warnings.      â¨Once the premises have been cleared of other individuals, you may want to ask the subject if he has any knowledge as to why you would be making contact with him. Speak  calmly and not authoritatively; tell the subject of your intent and tell him the nature of the complaint. Do not become accusatory, saying something like, âYou are dealing drugs.â Indicate that you are there to prove or disprove the information. Use your training and experience as an officer to guide you in the proper direction.      â¨Investigators may be surprised to learn that the subject may actually admit to drug trafficking or drug dealing from the residence. He may first state that he has no idea why  the officers would be there. At this time, the subject should be asked if he has a moment to speak with investigators to discuss some concerns regarding information that they received. The officers may provide limited information regarding the intelligence or information concerning the drug dealing. They may ask the subject if there are any narcotics in the premises and if so, if the subject would surrender them to law enforcement. There are cases where individuals will surrender a quantity of narcotics to the investigator. In other  cases, the subject will deny that involvement or possession of any narcotics.     â¨If the subject surrenders an amount of narcotics to the officer, the officer should not stop at that point. Sometimes a drug trafficker will provide a small amount of drugs to the officer and say that is all he has. The investigator should probe further, with consent of the subject, and ask if he has any more narcotics. Sometimes a subject will provide additional amounts of the substance. Officers must make sure that if the subject does give consent to search the premises that the consent is unequivocal. Silence or a nod of the head is not enough to provide consent to search.      â¨A subject may ask the officer if he has a search warrant and ask if it is required to search the premises. The answer to that question should be that a search warrant is not required  if the person gives consent. Do not make the mistake of telling the individual, âNo, but I can get one.â This mistake could be construed as a threat and could cause the search to be inadmissible in criminal court. No threats or promises should be made to the person who owns, leases, or rents the premises.     â¦     The advice is not to give up on the first thing the subject offers, but continue to ask if he may have other quantities of drugs or other evidence. If the subject does not surrender any substance, the officer would then ask for a consent search of the premises. If the subject refuses and there is no probable cause such as narcotics in plain view, the officers must terminate the encounter and leave the premises. If the individual agrees, one of the investigators should continue to speak with the individual as the other investigator immediately begins the search. If there is specific information as to where the narcotics are kept, investigators should go to that location first. It is important for the individual who takes the information during a tip complaint or during the debriefing of an informant to attempt to pinpoint where the narcotics may be situated in the premises. For example, a tip may indicate that the marijuana is kept in the refrigerator, above the kitchen cabinet, or in the bedroom. These are the first sites that the investigator should examine.      â¨If narcotics are found, investigators do not have to immediately confront the individual but may continue to search. Many agencies use code words for communication between investigators under these circumstances. Code words are a safe and effective way to communicate. If narcotics are located or an arrest is to be effected, a code word or phrase should be simple and, of course, be known by the investigators before the execution of the âknock and talk.â Investigators who have worked together for long periods of time should always use the same phrases. During a âknock and talkâ situation, one of the investigators may be searching in a back bedroom location while his partner is speaking to the owner of the premises. Once the contraband is found, the searching officer does not want to alert the individual that narcotics have been located. This is an opportunity to use a code word or phrase. Simple code words or phrases may be something like âDid you return the video?â or âWhat time are we going to lunch?â These are simple but effective phrases to alert your partner that you have found narcotics. This puts your partner in a better position, and the individual is not on alert that drugs have been located.      â¨The drugs should be left in the same position in the area in which they were located so the substance can be photographed by evidence technicians. This provides an accurate representation as to where the substance was found and how it was packaged. Additionally, the investigators should process the packaging for latent fingerprints for further identification.      â¨Further examination is suggested based on the consent search at the premises. Once the investigator feels comfortable that the search is complete, this may be the time to interview the subject further. Based on many of the court decisions with respect to recent case law, Miranda warnings should be read to the subject before questioning, once narcotics have been found. The individual may be escorted to the location where the narcotics have been found, or the interview process may begin before confronting the individual with the narcotics. Once the narcotics have been found and the person admits or denies ownership of the narcotics, the officers have several opportunities to further the investigation. If the subject admits to the narcotics and provides information as to the source of the drugs, investigators may take steps in attempting to identify and possibly further investigate the source.      â¨In many jurisdictions, officers have an option of not initially charging the person criminally, based on his or her cooperation in the case. If the person does not cooperate, officers can make an arrest. The âknock and talkâ provides a variety of different investigative options. Once a subject indicates he wants to cooperate, the investigator may want to use the person to contact his source to possibly make additional deliveries, or incriminating statements may be obtained with the help of the cooperative individual. A series of controlled telephone calls or contact with the source under controlled circumstances can be options.      â¨There are a number of other considerations during the âknock and talk.â One is written consent versus verbal consent. The law does not require written consent; however, it is a plus in the eyes of a court. A verbal consent is just as proper and often more practical. If it is the policy of the prosecutorâs office or individual police agency to have a written consent before a search, that should be adopted. Most police agencies today have a standard consent-to-search form which should be signed by the subject and witness officer.      â¨Some police agencies audio- or videotape their encounters. Each state is different; however, many have a one-party consent to audio taping, using a recorder, and videotaping of encounters. Other states require a two-party consent for audio- and videotaping. If the police agency has made a decision to use audiotaping during their encounters, it is strongly suggested that they do not use a âselective tapingâ technique. This puts the investigator and police agency in a precarious position. If officers record some encounters and not others, the court may question this, and the evidence may become inadmissible. The defense may question why his client was not audiotaped when subjects in other cases were. This puts the investigator in the position of having to defend himself as to why he did not audiotape a particular encounter. The defense may claim that the officer had something to hide in the case.      â¨It is a never a good policy to provide the subject of the allegation with any names, sources, or tips information when doing a âknock and talk.â Many âknock and talkâ cases result from information provided by an anonymous individual or source.      â¨Before conducting a âknock and talk,â presurveillance should be a consideration. The surveillance may be able to provide information as to how many people reside at the premises and other factors that will assist the investigator in determining when it would be most advantageous for the investigator to do the âknock and talk.â      â¨Another issue to consider is withdrawal of consent. If an officer obtains consent to conduct a âknock and talkâ and, while conducting the consensual search, the subject withdraws that consent, the officer must immediately terminate the search. If the evidence of narcotics has already been found and the subject withdraws consent, the consent search  should stop and a search warrant should be considered for the remainder of the premises.      ~~Use of a Drug Canine Team~~     â¨Trained drug canine teams are essential to an interdiction group. They can be used in a âknock and talkâ situation if the suspect consents to the use of the dog after consent is provided. The âknock and talkâ team should not take the dog with them to the door when making contact with the suspect. This creates an intimidating and coercive environment. If a drug canine is available, it should be kept out of sight while the consent is obtained by officers. The âknock and talkâ team may ask the suspect to consent to a trained drug dog examining the residence to expedite the search process. The officers may then ask for the canine team to enter the residence. This can be done in circumstances where there is information about hidden compartments in the residence or business. The use of the dog should be explained in detail to the suspect.   continued",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","weather420","59","2013-10-09T05:19:49","DAM (decentralized anonymous marketplace) â the concept","Discussion/Security","DAM (decentralized anonymous marketplace) â the concept  https://github.com/goshakkk/decentralized-anonymous-marketplace-concept  Silk Road has demonstrated that it's possible to run an anonymous online marketplace. While technologically it wasn't that bad, there was a critical point of failure â its centralized nature. Capture administrator and everything is doomed.  Here is my proposal of a distributed anonymous marketplace that doesn't have a single point of failure.  This concept does not focus on moral issues of participating in a voluntary anonymous trade nor does it enorse a specific use of a system it describes. It is more of a concept of decentralization of current marketplaces.  Let us start by looking at some of the problems that centralized marketplaces (like Silk Road) do have and try to figure a solution for them. Internal account balances  On most of centralized markets, every account got its internal balance. Users deposited money by sending them to DPR's wallets and the system credited the amount to their balance. On transactions between buyers & sellers, just the balances were updated and no actual money transfers took place. Moreover, the users didn't own these Bitcoin wallets so they were never in control.  It is, however, a bad idea to rely on a single person and trust all the money to them. Even if they are a good person themselves, there are violent third parties that can try to interrupt the operation any moment and try to seize the money.  So, that is a problem. Now. Problem, meet solution.  The solution is seemingly obvious. Let the parties transact directly without passing the money through the wallets of 3rd parties that can be compromised.  You own your money and don't have to trust anyone with it. Perfect, right?  But there is a reason they needed the money to pass through its wallets. It's because there was a need in arbitration. Luckily, there is a way to arbitrate without rising your money to someone... Arbitration  So, arbitration. It's needed to resolve disputes the buyer and seller might have. Like the item arriving not in time. Or not arriving at all.  The way it worked on SR was like this: you buy something, the payment is held in a ""pending"" state, unless you finalize the order. You finalize it if you got your item and you have no concerns about it.  If you do, however, you can dispute with the buyer. If you are unable to meet an agreement, the administrator steps in and tries to resolve your conflict. Depending on outcome, the money may be transferred to the seller, refunded to the buyer partially, or refunded to the buyer fully.  And that is why it was needed for the money to be held by this trusted third party. Relying on them is, again, a bad idea, and luckily, there is another solution to this problem.  The solution is Bitcoin transaction scripts. Without digging into much detail, there is a way to allow mediation of Bitcoin transaction. There is even an example on Bitcoin wiki.  Basically, it works this way:      the sender adds a public key of a mediator to the transaction, so that there are 3 people involved in transaction     once transaction is broadcast, it kind of stays in the ""pending"" state unless two of these three cast their vote on transaction  There are three possible outcomes:      the buyer and the seller do agree about the transaction, cast their ""yes""-s and money goes to the seller     the buyer does not agree and asks the mediator to help:         the mediator decides the seller didn't fulfill their part of agreement (e.g. didn't deliver) and casts a ""no"", and so does the buyer, then the transaction is no longer pending and the money is returned to the buyer         the mediator decides the seller did fulfill their part of agreement and casts a ""yes"", and so does the seller, then the transaction is no longer pending and the money reaches the seller  There are a few benefits to this scheme:      you do not have to trust your money to the mediator. At worst, the money ends up being in seller's/buyer's possession â but definitely not mediator since there is no way the mediator can change the output of transaction     the mediator doesn't have to be an admin or representative of the marketplace. It can be anyone that both the buyer & the seller trust  Inviting a third party mediator is an interesting idea, as it also removes the dependency on marketplace owner to mediate your dispute... but how would it work?  A reputation system. Everyone can be an arbitrator and they get chosen based on their reputation. Which is what the next chapter is about. Reputation  A system like Namecoin could be used to maintain identities and reputation of buyers, sellers, mediators, and marketplace owners. Federated distributed marketplaces  There is yet another reason that relying on a single entity is bad. Even if your money always transfers to the buyer directly, and mediation is done by a third party, there is one more thing that isn't distributed â the marketplace itself. If someone arrests or otherwise intimidates the owner, everything goes down. Boom. The money is still yours but the operations had stopped. You can no longer buy or sell.  As a solution, something like this might be proposed: marketplace app is OSS and everyone can run their own. And, indeed, it's a good solution. If some marketplace owner gets arrested, the others are still functioning and almost no harm is caused to everyone else.  Yet, there is a little thing that makes this approach far from desirable: discoverability, for one thing. You will have to manually discover a variety of marketplaces and signup for all of them. What if there was a better way?..  In fact, there is. There is this project called Diaspora. Basically, it's a social network that everyone can run. The key idea is that instead of tens or hundreds of separate social networks that everyone runs, there is one. Everyone can merely run a node that will host its user accounts, posts, and associated data.  It also enables for easier discovery. You can subscribe to users from various other nodes, see their posts, and so on. So it's a federated distributed social network.  A similar concept can be applied to anonymous marketplaces as well. Everyone can run their own node, and that node will store its users' account data and its own catalog.  From the user perspective though, there will be a single unified catalog of various goods. You visit ""Catalog"" and you see items from all federated marketplaces. Wrap up  The solution I propose will allow to get rid of centralization so that there won't be a single point of failure (central authority). The federated distributed marketplace will be much more difficult to shut down. And even in the case of shut down, no one is losing their money.  These are basically my thoughts on how such a system could be implemented. It's very likely that I missed something important or didn't fully think it through. All feedback would be highly appreciated.  Twitter: @goshakkk  Bitcoin: 18sQnMCavXPPBzWfTYXd9aDju6NbWc89NL",""

Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10. , or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V  Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.   N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.   Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

Maybe not so secure depending on your network?","Discussion/Security","Just a heads up to the community  http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/17/student-charged-bomb-threat/   Harvard College sophomore and Quincy House resident Eldo Kim, 20, has been charged in connection with Mondayâs unfounded bomb threat against four buildings on Harvardâs campus and will appear in U.S. District Court for a preliminary hearing Wednesday morning.  The public defender's office is currently representing Kim, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Christina DiIorio-Sterling. U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith G. Dein will oversee the hearing. Assistant U.S. Attorney John A. Capin is handling the case for the government.  Kim could face a maximum five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine if charged under the bomb hoax statute, according to a press release by the Boston U.S. District Attorneyâs office.  According to an affidavit filed with the office, Kim told authorities he was âmotivated by a desire to avoid a final exam scheduled to be held on [Monday].â Kim was present for that exam, which was held in Emerson Hall at 9 a.m., when the fire alarm went off, the affidavit says.  âAccording to KIM, upon hearing the alarm, he knew that his plan had worked,â the affidavit reads.  Earlier that morning, at approximately 8:30 a.m, Kim sent emails to two Harvard officials, an affiliate of Harvard University Police Department, and the President of The Crimson, saying that bombs had been placed two of four buildings: the Science Center, Sever Hall, Emerson Hall, and Thayer Hall. In those emails, Kim wrote, âbe quick for they will go off soon,â according to the affidavit.  The emails were sent using Guerrilla Mail, a free online application that generates temporary anonymous email addresses. Additionally, Kim used a free application called TOR, which generates a random anonymous IP address for temporary use that is difficult for law enforcement to trace.  According to the affidavit, authorities were able to determine that Kim had accessed TOR on the Harvard network before sending the email.  The threats prompted the evacuation of all four buildings shortly after 9 a.m. and led to the cancellation of several morning final examinations, as well as afternoon exams scheduled to take place in the Science Center.  A search by HUPD, the Cambridge Police Department, the Mass. State Police, as well as the Secret Service and the FBI Monday morning revealed no explosives. The four evacuated buildings were cleared throughout the afternoon.  The affidavit was submitted by Thomas M. Dalton, an FBI special agent, who along with a HUPD officer, interviewed Kim Monday evening in Quincy House.  In an emailed statement, a University spokesperson wrote, âWe are aware that a member of our community has been arrested in relation to this matter and are saddened by the details alleged in the criminal complaint filed by the United States Attorneyâs office today.â  University officials would not comment further on the ongoing criminal investigation.  On Saturday night, Kim sent an email over the Quincy email list timestamped 9:58 p.m. under the subject line, âHas anyone taken GOV 1368 The Politics of American Education?â  âI was wondering if anyone had taken GOV 1368: The Politics of American Education (Paul Peterson) in the past,â Kim wrote in the email. âI have several quick questions about the course.â  The final for Government 1368 was scheduled to take place at 9 a.m. on Monday in Emerson 210 and was among the exams evacuated Monday morning following the bomb threat. The Crimson could not immediately confirm if Kim was enrolled in the course.  Daniel P. Leichus â16, one of Kimâs roommates, said he had not heard anything about Kimâs alleged connection to the bomb scare until being interviewed by authorities around 9 p.m. Monday.  âI hadn't heard anything until police questioned me,â Leichus said in an interview with The Crimson Tuesday evening. âI didn't know anything except for the official police reports.â  The impact of the news seemed limited Tuesday night for Kimâs fellow residents in Quincy House. The Quincy dining hall was abuzz with busy students chatting and studying as usual for their own exams, enjoying an ice cream study break. Students interviewed there said they were not surprised to hear that the suspect is a student, citing Harvardâs highly stressful environment.",""

Team of DEA agents absolutely trash homes to the point of non-repair looking for drugs, money, documents and weapons. They also have no responsability to clean up or fix the damages caused to the property. They'll pull apart electronics, beds, coaches, door handles, light fittings, etc. Its absolutely crazy but I mean they do tend to find everything..   You really have been leaking a lot lately, all jokes aside. Yeah I was talking about local police lockup, well that is a pain. Are family members allowed to bring you items in?  If I ever am unfortunate enough to be arrested, I plan to simply comply. I see no reason to make the situation any worse than it already is, I've seen what happens to people who resist or talk smart even when cuffed/zip-tied. Police tend to turn a blind eye if another one of their officers wants to get a punch in or hit them with the baton. End of the day, its your word against theirs and if you've got no proof.. yeah lol.  This bothers me extremely, would an insurance company allow you to claim on forfeited goods?   I had a feeling that was going to be the answer, I'm guessing in the case that your attorney needs to forfeit the funds you'll still be expected to pay as-well lol.  I've read about family's assets being frozen as-well, how common is that/how does that work?  Team Nurse Meth vs team Great Dingers!","I was sitting in my terrible incriminating office wondering the same thing, definitely going to ask. I can't imagine a local PD would go to great extremes, but then, shouldn't they?;I have been arrested a few times (there goes some more opsec), they would never let you bring something in with you, but they can bring you a book if you're annoying the hell out of them for one. I'm assuming you're talking about local police lockup, not gaol.;If you don't mind I'll rush to answer things I've gotten the gist of from him previously. Unfortunately for our business, tools specifically used for the trafficking of drugs fall under ""forfeiture"" when it comes to the government's view on your property. However if you are found innocent and they have damaged your property it will be a very easy civil case for you, Slater & Gordon will probably already be waiting outside.;Haha. Hypothetically, the day I lose my case my lawyer will likely need to forfeit his pay, unless he can prove without a shadow of a doubt that he had no knowledge that the source of my funds were of a criminal nature. You can imagine that would be hard to do when you have just failed to defend a criminal, however we sorted that out initially by establishing a clear and legitimate source of my income that he was paid from. He was also paid before most things were brought to light to him, and it will never be admitted by either of us a lot of the things he was told.For those concerned, there is also a contingency plan to protect myself from those who would use these thread posts as evidence of one nurse joy obtaining a misleading lawyer.Upon reading your question properly , the answer is simply if you are arrested and have a fund set aside, you will need someone else to hold that fund and hire your lawyer for you, your assets will be frozen as again drug related things are quite strict.;QuoteI'll sit down with my team and see if there is any issues on their mind.Your team and my team should play team tug-o-war"

They would either send it on through to you without notification that it was inspected, or you would not receive it. If they are going to send it through to you they will have organise to arrest you soon after receipt of the item, and they likely wouldn't want a big WE LOOKED IN YOUR PACKAGE sticker on it when you get it.Past drugs convictions only come into play when the judge is handing down sentencing, if the judge finds you guilty of drug offences and you have past convictions, this will influence the judge to place a heavier penalty than someone with no priors.Sorry if I didn't answer the right question rushing around a bit"

Once that is in the back of your mind it seems pointless to speak. However I also strongly feel you should quickly and politely cooperate with identifying yourself and not obstructing any warrant conditions that may anger you at the time. Police act dramatically different to someone who is cooperative, even if its politely telling them you don't wish to speak.

A lawyer can never help you accelerate the events of any crime. If you told your lawyer you were committing fraud and needed help, they would legally advise you to not commit the crime. That's all they can do. If you tell a lawyer you plan to commit a crime regardless and he must perform his duties as a hired lawyer, unless you are soon approaching sentence, he should and is well within his rights to refer you to a different lawyer, and he almost definitely will. It's nowhere near worth the trouble.  The final part of your question, if the lawyer is anywhere near sure you committed the crime (either by you telling him, or by the obviousness of the case), he is obligated to represent you faithfully, but only without misleading the court. He could get you off on lack of evidence or mitigating circumstances.  You would need a Saul Goodman for what you are looking for, the best way to find this kind of person is to book sessions with criminal lawyers and ask if they could point you in the direction of someone of shakier morals. Lawyers know a lot of lawyers.   The answers come from an Australian lawyer, but he's pretty on the ball so it can't hurt to ask international questions.","I'm sure Nursejoy's lawyer advised her not to say a damn word until he gets there to do the talking for her.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","NurseJoy","53111","2014-10-21T09:30:48","Taking your questions to a Criminal Lawyer","Discussion/Legal"," I was sitting in my terrible incriminating office wondering the same thing, definitely going to ask. I can't imagine a local PD would go to great extremes, but then, shouldn't they?   I have been arrested a few times (there goes some more opsec), they would never let you bring something in with you, but they can bring you a book if you're annoying the hell out of them for one. I'm assuming you're talking about local police lockup, not gaol.    If you don't mind I'll rush to answer things I've gotten the gist of from him previously. Unfortunately for our business, tools specifically used for the trafficking of drugs fall under ""forfeiture"" when it comes to the government's view on your property. However if you are found innocent and they have damaged your property it will be a very easy civil case for you, Slater & Gordon will probably already be waiting outside.   Haha. Hypothetically, the day I lose my case my lawyer will likely need to forfeit his pay, unless he can prove without a shadow of a doubt that he had no knowledge that the source of my funds were of a criminal nature. You can imagine that would be hard to do when you have just failed to defend a criminal, however we sorted that out initially by establishing a clear and legitimate source of my income that he was paid from. He was also paid before most things were brought to light to him, and it will never be admitted by either of us a lot of the things he was told.  For those concerned, there is also a contingency plan to protect myself from those who would use these thread posts as evidence of one nurse joy obtaining a misleading lawyer.  Upon reading your question properly  , the answer is simply if you are arrested and have a fund set aside, you will need someone else to hold that fund and hire your lawyer for you, your assets will be frozen as again drug related things are quite strict.    Your team and my team should play team tug-o-war","In the result of a police search of a drug traffickers house, what level of search do they do? I've read about the different levels of searches they do in America, the big ones they'll unscrew power points and break open walls, etc.;Silly question disregard it if you'd like but if I was being arrested in my own home and asked an officer nicely and comply with all their instructions, would they let me take a book to read or would there be some sort of legal issue with allowing me to take something in with me? My biggest concern about being locked up is dying of boredom and this question crosses my mind a lot haha.;What happens with your seized electronics? Laptops, computers, USBs, etc. Are you able to get them back? What is the process for this? If they are damaged, is it too bad too sad or does the police reimburse you?;You may be able to answer this yourself. A criminal lawyer, paying them in advance for court fees with dirty money, can the police seize it? What kind of amount would you recommend aiming to put aside for a criminal lawyer to defend you? I've read $50,000 is generally the cost of a case in our type of situation but there was no source to it.;I'll sit down with my team and see if there is any issues on their mind."

If you are under investigation there is still no system in place for customs to intercept all your mail. Customs simply does not have the means to flag addresses in the sense that everyone thinks they do, however the AFP can flag addresses at a local post office level obviously.  Its difficult to explain because I do not understand it completely, but even if you have had 5 packages seized it was all done at random and it is likely that after a month or so you could try that address again and it would make it through customs, it just depends if your local post office has been told to notify the police of packages to an exact address and owner.    Anything ""leaked"" is done with great calculation as Mr Unforgiven alluded to =p  Local police is pretty lax, they want you to shut the hell up while they process your bail, which could take all day. If you wanted them to give you a book or whatever, then depending on the cop, you would either have to ask like a polite adult or scream like a baby until they gave you one.  Comply, but never help. Nothing you do to help the police will be used by the police in court to show your good nature, they are obliged to focus on everything they can use against you. That being said, dont give them things to use against you. Comply, don't help.   ","QuoteYou really have been leaking a lot lately, all jokes aside.

Team of DEA agents absolutely trash homes to the point of non-repair looking for drugs, money, documents and weapons. They also have no responsability to clean up or fix the damages caused to the property. They'll pull apart electronics, beds, coaches, door handles, light fittings, etc. Its absolutely crazy but I mean they do tend to find everything..

Are family members allowed to bring you items in?If I ever am unfortunate enough to be arrested, I plan to simply comply. I see no reason to make the situation any worse than it already is, I've seen what happens to people who resist or talk smart even when cuffed/zip-tied. Police tend to turn a blind eye if another one of their officers wants to get a punch in or hit them with the baton.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","NurseJoy","53111","2014-09-16T09:34:06","Taking your questions to a Criminal Lawyer","Discussion/Legal"," I spoke briefly with him over the phone (edit - a safe phone), just about our upcoming meeting. However I managed to get into the conversation a question about formatting my computer and the implications that could have if I was ever suspected. I'm certainly paraphrasing, but it definitely sounds like the ""I happen to shred a lot"" or ""oops I broke it"" defenses will be received as moot. Tampering with or destroying evidence is viewed as a matter that needs to be dealt with in the context of the crime. If you are suspected of a crime that would involve a lot of paperwork, but you have no other job, and you have a lot of shredded paper that you simply explain as ""I shred a lot"" - it will be viewed as a destruction of evidence that would have hurt your case. It will be very bad for your case, and you'll likely be charged with tampering. This could extend to a more sneaky destruction or tampering; what if your computer is heavily encrypted, it is seized, and you refuse to decrypt or claim to have forgotten how. Is your crime computer related? Too coincidental.  Basically, the point that he made was, an object may be destroyed before or during an investigation. If this object is brought into court as evidence, the judge asks him/herself, ""if this was not destroyed, would it help or harm the defendants case?"" most of the time if something was recently destroyed around the time of an arrest, it is likely to be presumed to have been evidence that would hurt the defendant.  Importantly, after this in mind it is also the plaintiff's burden to create a case around this destroyed evidence, to remove any reasonable doubt that this piece of evidence was useful in their case against a defendant. This would require additional evidence.  This causes me to ask the question, just how far can a defendant get screwed over by accidental or planted broken evidence?","how bad does apparent destruction of evidence look in court? does the 'i just happen to shred a lot' or 'oops i broke it' defence really work?"

However I managed to get into the conversation a question about formatting my computer and the implications that could have if I was ever suspected. I'm certainly paraphrasing, but it definitely sounds like the ""I happen to shred a lot"" or ""oops I broke it"" defenses will be received as moot. Tampering with or destroying evidence is viewed as a matter that needs to be dealt with in the context of the crime. If you are suspected of a crime that would involve a lot of paperwork, but you have no other job, and you have a lot of shredded paper that you simply explain as ""I shred a lot"" - it will be viewed as a destruction of evidence that would have hurt your case. It will be very bad for your case, and you'll likely be charged with tampering. This could extend to a more sneaky destruction or tampering; what if your computer is heavily encrypted, it is seized, and you refuse to decrypt or claim to have forgotten how. Is your crime computer related? Too coincidental.Basically, the point that he made was, an object may be destroyed before or during an investigation. If this object is brought into court as evidence, the judge asks him/herself, ""if this was not destroyed, would it help or harm the defendants case?"" most of the time if something was recently destroyed around the time of an arrest, it is likely to be presumed to have been evidence that would hurt the defendant.Importantly, after this in mind it is also the plaintiff's burden to create a case around this destroyed evidence, to remove any reasonable doubt that this piece of evidence was useful in their case against a defendant. This would require additional evidence.This causes me to ask the question, just how far can a defendant get screwed over by accidental or planted broken evidence?Interesting.

When it comes to tracking, if you sign for it then you're legally acknowledging your knowledge of what is inside the product to my knowledge. My question is, if you don't sign for a package but you're using a fake ID is that enough proof for the LE to say you had knowledge of the contents of the mail?  What is the current legal stance of handing over encryption keys in our court system? Would it be in your interest to obstruct justice in order to hide your sensitive information if you are told to hand over the encryption keys?  With importation charges, they go on a scale of weight depending on the illegal substances you're trafficking. My question is, if your weight is split over several packages are they considered as a total amount?   I would also like to hear the opinion of a criminal lawyer on the recent news about the NSW police hacking phones. Is a warrant required for this? Would it hold up in court?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","NurseJoy","53111","2014-09-23T22:59:17","Taking your questions to a Criminal Lawyer","Discussion/Legal","Interesting, from a Queensland Lawyer;  When advising my client to plead guilty I would need to explain the basis of my opinion to the client so that he or she can make a fully informed decision. It is after all their decision, not mine. It would also be important to mention that a guilty plea leads to a reduced sentence. If my client takes my advice, then I have acted in his or her best interests even though they have been convicted on their own plea. Of course, the interests of justice will also have been furthered in that a guilty person will have been convicted and a trial will have been avoided.  However, if the client listens to my advice and is adamant that they will plead not guilty, I have to accept their decision. It is an accused personâs right to plead not guilty, even if they did in fact commit the offence they are charged with. As their lawyer, I must not in any way seek to interfere with that right. In my years of practice I have represented a few clients who I have thought were guilty but wished to plead not guilty. This is something criminal defendant lawyers often do. There is nothing wrong with defending a client who I believe is guilty, for the reasons set out below.  I am not the person who determines guilt or innocence  The first reason why it is perfectly ethical to defend a client who I know or believe is guilty is that I am not the person whose role it is to decide whether or not my client is guilty. As Johnathan Goldberg has said, âa defending advocate is not there to stand in judgment upon his own clientâ. That role belongs to a judge or jury, as the case may be.   What if my client tells me they are guilty?  I have never had this happen to me, although I did once have a client who intimated that he committed the offence in question. I have spoken to other lawyers who have told me that a client confessing to their lawyer is nearly unheard of, although it did happen in the infamous Lake Pleasant case). Nevertheless, there are clear rules for lawyers in this situation.  Client confidentiality  One important rule that applies is client confidentiality. Even if a client confesses to me, as their lawyer I am bound by confidentiality to not disclose that communication. If I am ever called as a witness in court and asked about communications made by my client to me, I can claim privilege and refuse to answer the question. However, if a client confesses to someone who is not their lawyer (or an employee of a law firm) then such a confession can be disclosed and used in evidence. This is what occurred in the Max Sica trial. Sica was subsequently convicted for a triple murder.  Because I am my clientâs lawyer, I would be bound to keep the clientâs confession confidential. There are sound reasons for this. If I could or had to disclose such communications, then my role would be closer to that of an impartial investigator (such as a police officer) than a lawyer. This may well result in clients not trusting their lawyers and not being frank to their lawyers, even when they are innocent. There are many reasons why someone who is innocent of an offence may require confidentiality in order to have the confidence to reveal things to their lawyers which may assist his or her case. Weakening client confidentiality could result in innocent people being convicted, or mitigating facts not being raised during sentence.  Duty to not mislead the court  Notwithstanding client confidentiality, if my client admitted his or her guilt to me the obligation to not mislead the court would still apply. This obligation would alter how I can defend the client.  If a client tells me they are guilty I can still defend them, although I am not obliged to if someone else can be found in proper time to represent the client and the client does not insist I represent them. However, in defending my client I am not allowed to advance a positive case which I know to be untrue.   The rules provide that in such a case I:  (i) must not falsely suggest that some other person committed the offence charged;  (ii) must not set up an affirmative case inconsistent with the confession;  (iii) may argue that the evidence as a whole does not prove that the client is guilty of the offence charged;  (iv) may argue that for some reason of law the client is not guilty of the offence charged; and  (v) may argue that for any other reason not prohibited by (i) and (ii) the client should not be convicted of the offence charged  In other words, I can put the prosecution to proof (force them to prove their case) and argue that the evidence is not strong enough evidence for my client to be convicted.    Basically from the way I've been talking to my guy, I question hypothetical situations while never admitting to guilt. It seems your average lawyer would rather turn you away if you fully admit guilt, while some lawyers would be more inclined to get you out on a law loophole or lack of evidence.  To those saying ""lawyers don't do this"" or ""all lawyers do that"" - just remember there's a lot of them, covering probably the whole moral spectrum.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","NurseJoy","53111","2014-09-26T01:42:37","Taking your questions to a Criminal Lawyer","Discussion/Legal"," The first part of your question I interpreted as meaning, how much does it take for LE to be granted permission to start surveillance on a suspect?  I was referred to NSW courts documentation, which outlined:  The Surveillance Act was brought in to combat terrorism, murder and drug manufacture but it is clear that this power is no longer limited to pursuing these serious charges.  Under this act, all state police forces can listen into phone calls with warrants, as well as federal bodies such as the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and ICAC.  In order to get a warrant, the law enforcement officer must apply to a magistrate or judge.  The magistrate or judge may grant a warrant if there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion or belief founding the application.  In considering this, they must have regard to the following factors:      The nature and gravity of the offence     The extent to which privacy will be affected     The existence of other alternate means of obtaining the evidence     How useful the information that could be obtained is likely to be     Any previous warrant sought in connection with the same offence   Your second question I answered earlier in the thread, and the last I can conclude that if they had sufficient grounds for a surveillance warrant they would already have sufficient grounds to peek at your ISP records.    After our discussion, he has completely changed my perspective on this matter. I think it should be taken seriously (at least by Australians) the logical nature of how the law is applied to situations. It was explained that if you look at it from a judgmental point of view, having a package sent to your house that you sign for because someone is immediately presenting it to you can not be the sole basis for a conviction. If that was the only piece of evidence, your lawyer would possibly advise you to think of anyone in your life that might dislike you, and if it causes a reasonable doubt that they could have tried to incriminate you. You would not explicitly blame someone or infer that they did in fact frame you, but the statement that you believe it is possible that someone could have done this is enough to moot the evidence. In this unlikely scenario, where a case is built off of you simply accepting a package, then it likely would not make it to trial. If this situation occurred, the police would have to control the delivery, as they are not permitted to allow drugs to walk for more than a very limited time frame. If the recipient is smart they wouldn't open the package for an hour or so, which is much more time than police would generally allow. Of course, the police would be terribly unlucky to find no trace of other evidence, whether it be through financial auditing, communications, or physical discoveries in the house. In the case of uncovering even slightly assisting additional evidence, suddenly the coincidence is too great and there is likely a trial.  If you don't sign for a package but you're using a fake ID is that enough proof for the LE to say you had knowledge of the contents of the mail?  In the case of PO boxes if you have used a fake ID to obtain the box it will be very damning evidence if drugs were seized addressed to it. He didn't know what the case would be if you presented a fake ID to the postman while not signing for the package, but when explained as a narrative in a case it generally doesn't help to be committing fraud.   I think I explained some of this when I conveyed the information about evidence tampering. It is a difficult question and is generally specific to the judges interpretation of the evidence as a whole. If there is great evidence against you, and the prosecution is of the claim that more evidence is encrypted, if you specifically decline to decrypt the evidence you are entirely admitting that the evidence is as damning as the prosecution wishes to claim. You have the very difficult burden of proof that allows you the opportunity to give airtight reasoning as to why you cannot begin decryption. Saying you forgot is too convenient, especially if the method in which it was discovered by police implied that it was recently being used. If the evidence against you is baseless and is reliant on the encrypted information, your lawyer cannot advise that you mislead the court by hiding it but will explain to you that the evidence they currently have is not enough for a conviction, and that you can draw conclusions and instruct him accordingly.   When charges are filed it is based on the final total amount seized during investigation, while the time frame of receiving packages and the amount of packages would be explained during trial. Police may have the option to lay 5 charges for importing smaller weights, but they would never do this because they are well within their powers to consider the total as a single charge. It is also difficult for police to allow drugs to walk while continuing an investigation, so either the packages would all be seized around the same time and you'd be in trouble, or as soon as the first got picked up you would be in trouble, or the first package would be seized and you would likely stop getting the rest sent to yourself.   He is of the opinion that it is an expensive operation that would focus on capturing those suspected of being enemies of this country living domestically, terrorism, organised crime (the street kind), human trafficking crimes, and more relevantly those running importation operations through private shipping companies and other hidden avenues. Unless it is the kind of drug bust that will make the news, it is unfeasible to investigate through their spying system.   If a package is seized, depending on the schedule it is permissible to import a 3 months supply of certain drugs. If it is not a gross violation of this rule and it is possible you have a prescription (he thinks you could make an argument that one could legally import cocaine if they somehow obtained a prescription, due to it's relaxed scheduling), then they will send you a letter informing you of your options to either claim the goods, or do nothing. If you claim the goods, you may have to go to court to prove the right to import. If this happens you will need to pay court costs for both sides. If you do nothing, nothing happens. He is of the impression that this probably happens very frequently with prescription medicines and if it is under a 3 month personal supply it is likely not to raise any red flags for that address. If a package is seized that is larger than a 3 month supply, or illegal to import under any circumstances, then you will likely not be contacted and an investigation will begin around you without notification.   If you are operating as an individual this applies, but there is likely a certain threshold of the amount of times cashing out <$10,000 deems it necessary that you register as a business and declare your repeated cash flow. If you  have more than $10,000 worth of BTC and you are considered a personal user, then you have more than $10,000 in BTC, and it is a personal asset of yours. At some stage you likely would have had to pay tax on the money you used to obtain the BTC, because if you obtained the BTC as a payment or some other manner you would be considered a business, or at least generating capital gains. If you  spend more than $10,000 BTC the same principle applies, you would have had to be able to explain the origin of the BTC financially. Interestingly, if that quote is true and personal use assets you aquired for less than $10,000 is disregarded, then it would suggest that BTC you bought for $9000 could later grow in value to over $10,000 and remain disregarded.

When it comes to tracking, if you sign for it then you're legally acknowledging your knowledge of what is inside the product to my knowledge. My question is, if you don't sign for a package but you're using a fake ID is that enough proof for the LE to say you had knowledge of the contents of the mail?;What is the current legal stance of handing over encryption keys in our court system?

So perhaps the old 'toss the USB stick in the microwave' trick as they're battering down your door might not be the silver bullet I thought it might be.  Thanks for making the effort, Nursejoy. Your stock's risen considerably in my eyes. +1","Quote from: Mr.Pfister on September 16, 2014, 01:07:19 amhow bad does apparent destruction of evidence look in court? does the 'i just happen to shred a lot' or 'oops i broke it' defence really work?I spoke briefly with him over the phone (edit - a safe phone), just about our upcoming meeting. However I managed to get into the conversation a question about formatting my computer and the implications that could have if I was ever suspected. I'm certainly paraphrasing, but it definitely sounds like the ""I happen to shred a lot"" or ""oops I broke it"" defenses will be received as moot. Tampering with or destroying evidence is viewed as a matter that needs to be dealt with in the context of the crime. If you are suspected of a crime that would involve a lot of paperwork, but you have no other job, and you have a lot of shredded paper that you simply explain as ""I shred a lot"" - it will be viewed as a destruction of evidence that would have hurt your case. It will be very bad for your case, and you'll likely be charged with tampering. This could extend to a more sneaky destruction or tampering; what if your computer is heavily encrypted, it is seized, and you refuse to decrypt or claim to have forgotten how. Is your crime computer related? Too coincidental.Basically, the point that he made was, an object may be destroyed before or during an investigation. If this object is brought into court as evidence, the judge asks him/herself, ""if this was not destroyed, would it help or harm the defendants case?"" most of the time if something was recently destroyed around the time of an arrest, it is likely to be presumed to have been evidence that would hurt the defendant.Importantly, after this in mind it is also the plaintiff's burden to create a case around this destroyed evidence, to remove any reasonable doubt that this piece of evidence was useful in their case against a defendant. This would require additional evidence.This causes me to ask the question, just how far can a defendant get screwed over by accidental or planted broken evidence?"

Bitcoin, a currency that is essentially a computer code and is not backed by any government, has seen its value surge this year because of  interest from retailers and investors. But government agencies have also stepped up their oversight of the loosely regulated currency amid fears it could be used to facilitate criminal activity.  The two Senate hearings â the first to focus on bitcoin â are likely to examine how regulators are responding to the new forms of payment, the aides said. Potential points of discussion include how financial-industry regulators will watch over investment in the new currencies and how virtual currencies might impede tax collection or facilitate trade in illegal products out of the sight of law enforcement.  clarinet: http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/05/bitcoin-comes-under-senate-scrutiny/",""

Thank your lucky stars the server isn't responding, because if it did, you would likely have outed yourself. If I were in your shoes, I'd abandon your Safe-Mail account, just in case.   Needless to say, using your Mail client is most certainly NOT the way to do things,  especially where Silk Road is concerned. The Mac mail client does not know anything about Tor, so when it connects to an email server, it happily allows that server to see your real IP address. Needless to say, this is NOT a good idea.   Follow these instructions, and you should be ok -- just setup another email account. I'd recommend MailTor.   MailTor .Onion Server: http://mailtoralnhyol5v.onion/    MailTor Account rules:   Username: lowercase only minimum length 5 char, maximum length 20 characters   Password: case-sensitive, minimum length 5 char, maximum length 35 characters  Captcha is not required for login, but only for account setup.  The interface can be confusing... when you setup an account, type in the username, paste-in the password (twice) and type in the captcha, then press register -- from first appearances, it doesn't appear to take -- you are presented with a new captcha.  You have to look above where it says Register a new account. Under there, in green, it will say Welcome  username@mailtor.net.  If you see that, just above where you entered in the username and password to set the account up, you know the account is setup. You can then enter the username and password combo in the login fields below.  Follow these instructions:   GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected.  If you have Leopard (10.5) then you're pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.   If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9) the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.   Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg  Once you have installed GPGTools,  what you want to do is to go into System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Services.  Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.   Keyboard shortcuts:  ==================  OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:             Shift-Command-E  OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:     Shift-Command-I  OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:         Shift-Command-F  OpenPGP: Insert My Key:                 Shift-Command-K  OpenPGP: Sign Selection:                Shift-Command-R  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V   Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected. Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.   To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.   Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:   Other Commands You May Need: ============================  OpenPGP: Decrypt File:                   Control-Command-D  OpenPGP: Encrypt File:                   Control-Command-E  OpenPGP: Sign File:                      Control-Command-S  OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:       Control-Command-V   Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.   To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient's PGP public key.   Once you have located someone's PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.   Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.   To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).   When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.   To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.

He needs a way of getting a 750-pound Bitcoin ATM off a wooden pallet, so it can be anchored to the floor in this Vancouver coffee shop.  Demeter is one of three partners who have shelled out more than $90,000 to buy five ATMs that handle bitcoins, the worldâs most popular digital currency, and today theyâre going through the steps of installing their very first one at Waves Coffee, right next to the provincial courthouse in downtown Vancouver. As far as we know, this will also be the first operational Bitcoin ATM on the planet.  Trading bitcoins for cash is a bit of a grey area, as far as financial regulations are concerned. In the U.S., companies that do this typically need to register as money transmission businesses with both state and federal regulators. In Canada, however, the regulations arenât so onerous. Thatâs why the machine is making its debut here.  With press and curious onlookers watching, Demeter and his business partner spent about an hour this morning unpacking their brand new ATM, built by a Nevada company called Robocoin. The machine scans your palm and then will sell you bitcoins for cash â or vice versa. Itâs set to go live tomorrow.  Until then, they have a day to test that it works, connect it to a bitcoin exchange, fill it with money, and, of course, anchor it to the ground.  Theyâll also have to plug it in. For a few panicky moments this morning, Demeter and Warren thought their    Bitcoin ATM had been shipped without a power cord. But then they opened up the machine and discovered it inside. We found the ATMâs key lying on a cafe table. âOh my god, give me that,â said Warren. âIâm so bad with keys.â  When operational, the machine will be able to do up to 3,000 Canadian dollar worth of transactions per day. You donât need any form of identification to use the ATM, but it comes equipped with a palm scanner, thatâs used to make sure that users donât exceed the 3,000 per day limit.  âWe donât want drug dealers sending a bunch of coke to the States and then withdrawing cash,â says Warren. âwe donât want these to turn into money laundering machines; thatâs the worst thing that could happen.â",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Great God Pan","3621","2013-11-19T04:12:40","Cables Communication in LibertÃ© Linux: A Review","Discussion/Security","Cables Communication in De(e)su  LibertÃ© Linux  1.  Overview - What is Cables?  Liberte Linux website:  http://dee.su/liberte Cables Communication website: http://dee.su/cables Cables Github source code: https://github.com/mkdesu/cables  From the website:  ""Cables communication implements secure and anonymous communication using email-like addresses, pioneered in LibertÃ© Linux. Cables communication is LibertÃ©'s pivotal component for enabling anyone to communicate safely and covertly in hostile environments.""  Cables is included by default inside Liberte Linux: upon startup the RSA key for the Cables username is generated and Claws Mail is configured to send and receive messages through Cables.  Although its primary purpose is to exchange messages over an anonymising network (Tor by default, but I2P is also an option), the protocol itself is independent of Tor/I2P meaning it could function over the clearnet, just not anonymously.  Therefore the Cables protocol itself includes a key exchange and message encryption:  X.509 certificates, ephemeral Diffe-Helman (EDH) for perfect forward security, and the CMS standard for encrypting the message.  Authentication is done through the usernames, which are hashes of certificates, thereby guaranteeing the sender's authenticity.  Compared to Torchat ( a synchronous chat client) and Pond (an asynchronous email-like client), Cables is a hybrid.  It has all the feel of being asynchronous and email-like (down to the Claws Mail integration), but requires both the message sender and recipient to be online at the same time in order for the message to be transferred.  To help offset the dual-online requirement for successful communication the Cables client and protocol is robust in ensuring that messages are either delivered with explicit delivery confirmations, or the sender is notified of a delivery failure.  Messages don't get lost and there is no ambiguity in regards to send/delivery status.  2.  Running Cables for best results  In order for a Cables message to be exchanged between sender and recipient, both users must have their Cables client online at the same time.  Assuming most people will run Cables as an extension of Liberte (instead of compiling it on a different Linux distribution) it may prove difficult to leave a laptop or PC booted with a Liberte USB for the long periods of time to allow Cables to act as an asynchronous email-like service.  A solution to this may be to run a copy of Liberte inside a virtual machine for the specific purpose of being an on-all-the-time Cables client. The Liberte website directs to Source Forge where an .OVA file can be downloaded and imported into a virtual machine such as VirtualBox.  An option may be to use Truecrypt to create a file container in which to house a portable version of Virtual Box and the corresponding files for the Liberte virtual machine.  A simple tutorial may look like this:     1.  Create an encrypted file container with Truecrypt.  A size of 500Mb should be sufficient.  Mount the volume.    2.  Download and install portable Virtual Box inside the Truecrypt volume.    3.  Download the .OVA Liberte file (link to the source forge download page from the Liberte website)    4.  Open portable Virtual Box and import the .ova file to create a new Liberte virtual machine.    5.  Start the virtual machine, choose a long passphrase, and wait for the Cables CA key to be generated.  It may be wise to bang on the keyboard before the OTFE volume creation phase for a minute or so to help generate a bit of extra entropy.  Liberte uses the haveged entropy daemon to fill the entropy pool during startup, but the jury is still out on its effectiveness in a virtual machine, so some extra typing and mouse moving won't hurt.    6.  Go to bottom-left menu --> internet --> Cables Identity and note the address to share with those you wish to communicate with (Cables IDs should be treated with care, as an ID is vulnerable to DOS attacks)    7.  Open Claws Mail from bottom left icon on screen.  Send and receive Cables messages from here.  Leave the VM running all the time if possible to facilitate message exchange.  3.  How Cables Works  Cables works by having each user run a small web server from inside their copy of Liberte over Tor, making itself a hidden service: a 1024 bit RSA key is created for use as the .onion address.  In addition to the .onion address, the username created on first start-up is a hash of a 8192 bit X.509 RSA self-signed root certificate.  In this manor when a user shares her Cables address, she is providing the public keys for both her username and the hidden service.  During a message exchange Tor guarantees hidden service requests reach the correct destinations, and the root CAs are checked to verify the hash matches the user names.    In addition to the hidden service webserver, there is a small Cables daemon which runs in the background and will initiate a series of bash shell scripts (called loops) depending on the state of any particular message exchange.  All of the username / key verification, ephemeral key generation, and message encryption is done inside these scripts using OpenSSL command line functions.  Work done by the scripts produces files stored in a queue directory for each message.  It should be noted out that the data stored in these directories are done so in the clear: Cables assumes that the security for the OTFE persistent volume is enough to cover the messages received from other Cables users.  If someone gains access to your Liberte OTFE persistent volume, she will have access to your Cables messages.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Great God Pan","3621","2013-11-19T04:13:45","Cables Communication in LibertÃ© Linux: A Review","Discussion/Security","5.  Possible Issues.  5a - Encrypt-AND-MAC.   The authenticated-encryption type used in cables is Encrypt-AND-MAC.  The MAC is computed on the plain-text message first, then the message is encrypted with CMS format using AES CBC mode.  The preferred method of authenticated encryption is to encrypt the message first and then compute the MAC over the cipher text.  This method is Encrypt-then-MAC and has been shown to always build a authenticated encryption system, whereas Encrypt-AND-MAC will only sometimes succeed.  In fact this falls under Moxie's Cryptographic Doom Principle: If you have to perform any cryptographic operation before verifying the MAC on a message you've received, it will somehow inevitably lead to doom.  Indeed in Cable's case, the client decrypts the message before computing the send MAC on the plain text message in order to compare it to and verify against the received send MAC.  Other systems have been shown to be vulnerable to padding and timing attacks due to this issue.  So far in reading the Cables code it looks to walk a fine line though the Encrypt-AND-MAC pitfalls in that it seems secure.  First, the keys used for the message and MACs are only used once.  Second, although the MAC is computed on the plain text message, the HMAC algorithm does not leak information on the plain text.  The CMS encryption operation in OpenSSL was once susceptible to a padding attack, but was fixed in 2012.    The author of Cables mentioned the reason for MACing the plain text message was to add weight to the receive MAC: receiving a MAC over the plain text allows Alice to state that Bob successfully decrypted the message.  Although true, it would be just as easy to MAC the cipher text for the send MAC then MAC the plain text for the receive MAC.  This would allow Bob to verify the MAC first and pass the Cryptographic Doom Principle, while still allowing Bob to compute the receive MAC over the plain text and give Alice the statement that he successfully decrypted the message.  Reference 1:  http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/ Reference 2:  http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/papers/thesis/thesis.pdf  5b - Less Than Optimal EDH Key Exchange  The goal of a Key Exchange (KE) is to bootstrap a known identity (username of recipient in this case) into a secure communication channel.  For Cables, the communication is simplified due to the fact a single message is to be sent in one direction.  Nevertheless, KE protocol theory has come a long way since the its start with Diffe-Helman in 1976.  Nowadays there are several protocols which have been proven secure; to use something less despite the availability of secure options is not desirable.  Cables has a goal to offer secure communication regardless of the network it is operated over, whether that be Tor, I2P, or something new.  Therefore its KE exchange protocol should not rely on Tor nor i2p to cover any shortcomings.  The KE should be independently secure and robust.  Cables uses a very simple and basic protocol which when reduced looks like this:  A                                                                        B ------------------Nonce, username-------------------> <--------------------B, SIGb(g^y)----------------------- ----------------------A, SIGa(g^x)--------------------->  Cables uses usernames, a root CA, and a sign/verify certificate from the CA, but all of that can be rolled into the public identity A for Alice and B for Bob.  This looks good and offers security against a passive listener, but it is vulnerable to an active attack.  Consider the following:  ** Long term impersonation from a compromised ephemeral private key value.  Eve observes a series of previous message communications between Alice and Bob (or Eve could exchange a message with Bob).  From a single exchange Eve knows both usernames, both public root CAs, both public verify certificates, and the signed copies of the ephemeral DH (EDH) key values.  From subsequent conversations Eve gains additional signed EDH keys.  If Eve is ever able to discover one single EDH private key, she would then be able to impersonate the original owner of the EDH private key in perpetuity.  The problem is that the KE protocol above does not check for 'freshness' in each exchange (i.e. requiring both parties to prove they have the private signing key for each new key exchange).  Although the chances of an attacker discovering the private key of an 8192 bit DH value are slim, the design still violates the principle that ephemeral leakage should not allow for long-term compromise.  To prevent that the Basic Authenticated DH (BADH) protocol has each party sign the peer's DH value as a freshness guarantee:  A                                                                           B ---------------Nonce, username, g^x------------------> <-----------------B, SIGb(g^x, g^y)---------------------- -------------------A, SIGa(g^x, g^y)-------------------->  Although better, the BADH protocol (and current Cables implementation) is also vulnerable to an Identity-Misbinding Attack.  ** Identity-Misbinding Attack.  Consider the following example:  A                                                                      E                                                                     B ------------Nonce, A-username----------->                       ------------Nonce, E-username----------> <--------------B, SIGb(g^y)-----------------                       <---------------B, SIGb(g^y)---------------- ----------------A, SIGa(g^x)--------------->                       -----------------E, SIGe(g^x)-------------->  Here Eve replaces Alice's identity with her own, but lets Bob's portion of the KE flow back to Alice unchanged.  The result is that Alice knows she is communicating with Bob, but Bob thinks he is communicating with Eve!  Although Eve is unable to discover the shared secret g^xy, an identity misbind as outlined above is definitely undesirable (for example, ""Send me 5BTC"").  5c - KE Solutions  The ISO KE protocol is a secure protocol in that it can be shown that any attack on the ISO KE would in fact be an efficient attack on the underlying cryptographic primitives.  Adopted to the Cables protocol outline, it would look like this:  A                                                                              B ----------------Nonce, username, A, g^x----------------> <------------------B, SIGb(g^x, g^y, A)------------------- ---------------------SIGa(g^x, g^y, B)-------------------->  Identity-misbinding attacks are thwarted by signing the identity of the peer.  Implementing this in Cables would require updating the loops which prepare and validate the extra signature material.  There would also need to be updates to the server to send/receive the http-get requests for the additional signature material.  Updates to the loop portions that handle cleanup / ephemeral material deletion.  The changes required for an ISO KE are understood to be non-trivial, but worth the effort to ensure Cables is resistant to active attacks instead of simply against passive eavesdropping.  One step of improvement over the ISO protocol is a KE system which protects identity as well as thwarting active and passive attacks.  It also removes another concern, which is evidence of proof of communication (Alice signs Bob's identity, and visa-verse in ISO).  This protocol is known as the 'Sign-and-MAC' or SIGMA protocol.  Under SIGMA each peer signs both public EDH keys as well as MACing their own identity.  It is proven secure in the same manner as ISO.  SIGMA provides identity protection for both peers against passive attacks, and for the initiating peer under an active attack.  The protocol is as follows:  A                                                                                                             B ---------------------------------------Nonce, g^x-----------------------------------> <---------------------g^y, {B, SIGb(g^x, g^y), MACkb(B)}ke'------------------ --------------------------{A, SIGa(g^x, g^y), MACka(A)}ke-------------------->  Note that the identity certificates for both users are protected by an encryption key derived from the shared secret.  The identity certificates of Alice are always protected, while Bob's identity is protected from passive listening.  Cables usernames derived from the root CA certificate could be sent with the nonce (MSGID) in the clear, or inside the encryption packet later in the KE depending on privacy goals.  It would take some effort to change the current Cables code to implement the identity protecting SIGMA protocol.  However, the benefits of an impregnable identity protecting KE protocol on top of an anonymizing network would truly allow Liberte and Cables to make the claim that it provides a mission critical communication aid in hostile environments.

When Alice wishes to send Bob a Cables message, her Cables client sends an http-get request to Bob's hidden service.  Her http-get request contains her username, onion hostname, and a unique message-ID (msgid).  Bob's hidden service reads and process this request and prepares a msgid sub-directory under his receive queue directory.  Alice's username and host name are saved there.  Bob's client also prepares a 8196 bit EDH key value, signs it with the certificate issues by his root CA, and stores it along with the public parts of the root CA and the issued certificate in the msgid directory.  Alice's client sends another series of http-get requests to Bob's hidden service and reads back Bobâs CA, certificate, and signed EDH value.  Alice uses Bob's CA to check it hashes correctly to his username, and verifies the authenticity of the issued certificate, and the signature on the EDH value.  Her client combines her private EDH value with Bobâs public value to compute an 8196 bit shared secret, which is HMAC'd to produce the message encryption key, and send / receive message authentication code (MAC) keys.  The send and receive MACs are computed on the plain-text message.  The message is encrypted using the OpenSSL cms -EncryptedData_encrypt command line function, which uses 256-bit AES in CBC mode.  It should be noted that the authenticated-encryption being done here is encrypt-AND-MAC (as opposed to MAC-then-encrypt or encrypt-then-MAC).  More on this point later.  A final acknowledge message is computed as the HMAC of the shared secret with the text 'ack' as the HMAC key.  Once the encryption and MAC computations are finished, Alice sends a final http-get request containing the send MAC.  Upon receipt of Alice's http-get request containing the send MAC, Bob's client initiates a series of http-get requests to Alice's hidden service.  In these requests Bob's client reads back the encrypted message, Alice's signed part of the EDH key, and her CA and its issued certificate.  Bob's client verifies her CA hashes to her username, checks the issued certificate, and checks the signature on her part of the EDH key.  Bob's client computes the shared secret from Alice's portion of the EDH key and proceeds to compute the keys for the message, send/receive MACs, and the final acknowledge message.  Bob's client decrypts the message with the OpenSSL -cms -EncryptedData_decrypt command then computes the send and receive MACs using the HMAC function along with the computed keys.  Bob's client compares the send MAC he received from Alice's last http-get request with the send MAC he just calculated.  If the two MACs match, Bob's client accepts the decrypted message as valid and stores it in the receive queue directory.  Bob's client sends a final http-get request to Alice's hidden service containing the receive MAC it computed on the message from the shared secret.  When Alice's hidden service web server receives the http-get request with Bob's receive MAC, her client checks that her computed MAC matches the received mac.  If so, her client sends a final http-get request to Bob's hidden service containing the acknowledge MAC.  Alice's client marks the message as being sent successfully.  Bob's client checks the MAC against his computed version.  If they match, his client marks the message as a valid new message.  Here is the message exchange protocol seen along with the direction of the client-to-hidden-service http-get requests:  Alice:  CAa - X.509 Root self-signed certificate authority, hashed to produce username A - Certificate for signing/verifying EDH keys, issued by CAa SIGa(g^x) - Alice's public portion of the EDH key, signed with A m - Message Alice wishes to send to Bob {m}ks - Message encrypted with AES in CBC mode with key ks derived from shared secret MACsend(m) - Send MAC: HMAC of the message m with send-key derived from shared secret MACawk(ss) - Acknowledge MAC: HMAC of the shared secret with a salt text as key  Bob:  CAb - X.509 Root self-signed certificate authority, hashed to produce username B - Certificate for signing/verifying EDH keys, issued by CAb SIGb(g^y) - Bob's public portion of the EDH key, signed with B MACrecv(m) - Receive MAC: HMAC of the message with receive-key derived from shared secret  A                                                                                                                                     B ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>                            -----Peer Request (MSGID, Username, Hostname)----->                            <---------------------CAb, B, SIGb(g^y)-----------------------                            ---------------------------MACsend(m)------------------------> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->                                                                                         <-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                             --------------------CAa, A, SIGa(g^x), {m}ks---------------->                            <--------------------------MACrecv(m)--------------------------- <--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->                             -----------------------------MACawk(ss)-------------------------> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->   ",""

Comments on the last post seemed to confirm that these ""not easy"" experiences were not uncommon. This makes me wonder both why people on the forums reflexively recommend localbitcoins and secondly what people are doing instead. Going from btc to fiat seems to be quite the nightmare for many people.   Easy Come, Easy Go  http://buttcoin.org/easy-come-easy-go  Cash-Out  Letâs start the new year off right: with bitcoins! When last we heard from our long-suffering friends, they were waiting for CaVirtEx to complete a transfer to a bank account.  So more stuff on trying to cash out of bitcoins and how âsimpleâ it is.  Virtex responded to my friends ticket, and said yesterday said that the transfer that was fucking requested on the 18th, was cleared. However today my friendâs bank has not received a anything. So he calls them and apparently they canât deal with this over the phone and will only help him if he puts in a ticket. Even though he pointed out that it takes them a week to respond to tickets.  Also my friend decided to try and just sell 2 of his bitcoins on localbitcoins through their online escrow because apparently people keep telling him e-transfers are safe, because interac e-transfers cannot be reversed! So perfectly safe! Yesterday he accepted an e-transfer and was able to add the money to his account and release the escrow.  Then this morning apparently he was notified by his bank that his account and all associated cards are frozen, and he must come into his local branch and speak to someone. They apparently wouldnât explain why over the phone. Apparently the person he spoke to had some idea of what bitcoins were (negativeman-55f), and after explaining how he sold them. The guy apparently explained that:  - Selling stuff online and using e-transfer for payment apparently violates some part of interacâs terms of service. - The e-transfer he accepted was fraudulent so it was reversed (i thought it wasnât reversible!) - His account is to be unfrozen but he is permanently banned from ever using e-transfers again  It is funny because all the âlowâ risk methods of selling on localbitcoins, are terrible that nobody really uses. I love how many people messaged me about how safe localbitcoins are.  Nobody here is shocked in the least. More about the local bitcoin sales and the trustworthy individuals involved with them:  Pretty much all the methods of payment on localbitcoins are ether unsafe, or terrible from what i can tell. The two exceptions are cash (we know how well that worked out), or a cash deposit (pretty massive pain in the ass), which both are pretty inconvient.  However localbitcoins lists some other payment methods, and ranks them on âlowâ, âmediumâ, or âhighâ risk. The low risk includes well known and âtrustworthyâ payment services like EGOPay, OkPay, and Perfect Money. Ironically there is also Western Union, a service which bitcoiners declared bitcoin will kill off. The funny part is, nobody uses the low risk payment methods really, because they are all a massive pain in the ass.  Pretty much all the people on Localbitcoins (and there really is not very many in Canada, less than 200 including people who have not logged on in a month), want you to use something like e-transfers, wire transfers, paypal, etc. Which are all not safe at all. Since one party can cry fraud and boom, you loose your money and they walk off with the bitcoins. Well obviously the best solution is to let your feedback/reputation dictate if your a scammer or not. I see this everywhere:  quote: If your LocalBitcoins profile has less than 10 confirmed trades or at least 1 negative feedback then you must send/release Bitcoins first.  quote: Unless you have a feedback rating of 10 or higher, coins will be sent to me first direct to my receiving address. If you have a feedback of 10 or higher then we may use the escrow system (although I will pay 0.5% more if you send it direct).  quote: Because of our established credibility, if you have a feedback score below 10 weâll require the BTC to be sent first, either directly to our receiving address or released via trade request.  emot-smugdog Fuck you pleb, escrow is only for us captains of the industry emot-smugdog  OKPay: Does Localbitcoins even know that OKPay does not allow people to use their service for selling crypto-currencies?  quote: Please note that due to the card issuer bank restrictions OKPAY Card order and funding becomes impossible if you perform operations related with crypto-currencies or crypto-currencies exchange.  Our financial provider for GBP bank transfers restricts further usage of funds for purchasing or exchanging crypto-currencies.  Link  If you look around there is some nice whining from people that OKPay has cancelled and closed their accounts for selling bitcoins. But you know, its âlow riskâ.  Perfect Money: A virtual wallet service, that nobody seems to use. You need to make an account, get verified, get the money into your account, then wait 3-5 days for the transaction to be approved they also apparently do not allow you to withdraw all your money in one shot and you must keep a minimum balance of 300$ at all times. Also from what i can gather the only way to send money is by sending someone an e-voucher. There is no way to verify the value of an e-voucher, nor is there a way to reverse it. So of course this means that all the buyers want you to send them the bitcoins first then they will send you the voucher and not disappear. Apparently only 3 people on localbitcoins is willing to use this method.  Ego Pay: Some sort of virtual online wallet service. Requires you to become verified to withdraw money from there. Also there is some really sketchy stuff in their terms and conditions:  quote: EgoPay reserves the right to terminate accounts that act as unauthorized e-currency exchangers and all of the related accounts.  Would selling bitcoin count as an e-currency exchanger? I donât know i canât find a single post about someone using EGOPay. However the single most stupid thing about Ego Pay is:  quote: EgoPay account holders can withdraw funds from EgoPay by using Payza or e-currency exchangers. Times to complete a withdrawal may vary due to security reasons, please visit our FAQ for current information.  So let me get this straight, Ego Pay doesnât even let you withdraw money to your bank account. You need to withdraw it to another FUCKING SITE? Donât forget no fees*(only 2.5% for deposit/withdrawal).  So? Bitcoin -> Localbitcoins -> Ego Pay -> Payza -> Bank -> Fiat  staredog.001  Western Union: Aside from the fact that all of the buyers expect you to be responsible for 7% fee even though they are already paying you much less than the âactualâ price (aka whatever exchange has the highest price, bitcoiners claim thats the value of bitcoins). There are only 38 users willing to buy, and only 18 of them have logged into localbitcoins in the last 7 days. Furthermore, some of the buyers will not deal with you for western union UNLESS you send them the coins FIRST. Aka no escrow.  quote: Unless you have a feedback rating of 10 or higher, coins will be sent to me first direct to my receiving address. If you have a feedback of 10 or higher then we may use the escrow system (although I will pay 0.5% more if you send it direct).  I am sorry i simply cannot trust people on localbitcoins when the entirety of their forum consists of users crying about getting scammed, by people who are supposed to be reputable. I love how bitcoiners dance between âDONT TRUST ANYONEâ, to âtrust me with your 20,000$ exchange, i swear i wonât scam you cause i have a whole 20 feedbackâ.  Donât you guys see how great and simple these âlowâ risk methods are? Honestly buying and selling bitcoin has never been easier.  Clearly LocalBitcoins could benefit from BitcoinTalkâs big red âSCAMMERâ tags. That way youâd know not to send your bitcoins directly to someoneâs receiving address before they consider paying you real money for them.",""

It's a free book that every single hacker cut his teeth on http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/  You will also learn calculus as you do this book, like how to solve differential equations in code and how to recognize them for optimization.  The first thing I do when auditing code is look for the differential equations the orig author missed. Solve those and code is literally twice as fast.  You can use racket (scheme) to do the book, it's available on their site. Even better Yandex Cloud out of Russia, provocatively named ""Cocaine"" offers racket as well, so backend mobile apps or web apps no problem. After you've mastered Scheme/Lisp feel free to move on to coursera.org programming courses like Algorithms I & II from Princeton University, Computer Science 101 (python) and of course the MIT Open Courseware free courses. If you want to learn C just download K&R C book after doing SICP.  Actually everything after SICP is easy.

You'll learn basic logic (critical for for all of your conditional statements), a lit bit of probability, combinations, trees and basic set theory. There's probably more I'm forgetting. The set theory is important when you get to higher levels of theoretical computer science like recursive and recursively enumerable sets (decidability).  Also, depending on how deep you want to get into CS, linear algebra could be critical. Applications are most apparent in computer graphics. Linear algebra is taken after the calculus sequence, not because it's related to calculus, but because you need a moderately mature mathematical mind to wrap your head around some of the fantastically abstract and mindblowing concepts.   But for you, just wanting to learn how to program, I would say just read up on some of the topics from any discrete mathematics book. Most important would be the logic.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Frigga","8702","2013-12-15T19:30:17","Where can I learn more about computers and programming","Discussion/Security","You only need as much math as the problem you're trying to solve requires.  I'd say more important than math is learning how to break a problem down into small, manageable pieces that can be reused in other, similar problems. I don't think you'll need discrete math for a while; however, it's not too hard.  Discrete math is basically logic and counting in terms of integers. I think the math most relevant to your level is boolean algebra.  Once again, it's really simple and you can either look it up or ask me to explain. Another useful thing to understand is big-o notation.  Big-O notation is basically the worst case scenario for an algorithm in relation to the size of the original input.  It can be used to describe the run-time of an algorithm or the amount of memory it uses. For example, let's examine an algorithm that is looking for a specific number in a list of unordered numbers.  You need to start at the beginning of the list and go through each number in the list one by one to compare each number to the number you're looking for.  In the worst case scenario, the number is either at the end of the list or not in the list; therefore, if the list is of size n, you will need to look at all n numbers before getting your answer, so it is O(n) in terms of run-time. However, the algorithm doesn't store the list anywhere else; it uses memory that was already allocated, so it is O(1) in terms of storage.  Keep your head up.  When you look at what you have to do to master any one profession, it looks overwhelming.  It actually doesn't take much time to become a decent programmer (I'd say three semesters at college and you know all the basics).  The hard part is becoming a good programmer.  As a decent programmer you can solve any problem a good programmer can; it just takes you longer and your code is less elegant.",""

You can use this passphrase to decrypt the tar later again using:  If you forget the passphrase, the compressed backup tar file will be useless to you. Do not expose your tar file to unsafe systems, and do not use a weak passphrase if you want your files to remain safe and secure. If you're using some of the options for persistence volumes, you may need to modify the tar command to exclude some dirs that may be giving you trouble because of locks in use.  Here's an example of my command: /live/persistence/sdb2_unlocked/ is where the persistence volume files are stored for me.

You just follow the blockchain to the buyer or from the vendor to his/her cash out site.   This article on Forbes might've been seen on here plenty, but it shows that we can't just keep the same addresses. Sure, addresses will eventually need to be reused and eventually an address I may have, you might get one day, but that at least makes it harder to track a specific user. They would track my BTC address but by time it's not connected to me anymore it won't be showing all the transactions going to my accounts, it will be going to other accounts, making it harder to tell who exactly did what with it. Tumbling is definitely necessary for Vendors, and even buyers. It's a bitch to tumble your coins when you want to buy something quickly, but you should never send BTC straight to SR, that's an instant giveaway. But even if you route it through an anonymous blockchain address, or a hard copy, paper address, it can still be followed, which is why tumbling is the best option as far as I can tell. BTCFog is the only one I know of too. And even with those, it's obvious that the BTC addresses are coming to/from SR and other Darknet sites, but at least they can't tell exactly what transaction they came from or are going to. But when you have 5 unchangable BTC addresses to SR, eventually all they have to do is identify those addresses and reverse track it until they find one that goes to a Verified account. That's the biggest downside of BTCs, at some point (most people) have to get rid of them with their own name. I know you can buy cash from vendor's like gold, but you lose a lot of money. I wouldn't mind losing 100 dollars per 1k or something, but I think it's more than that. Anyways, what do you think the best way to cash out is, the safest way? Because as a vendor, I cash out more than I buy, when i buy I usually just use the BTCs I profit. But even that can be a bitch, because you should still tumble when moving from one account to another because if you are a vendor and you buy something with you buyer's account from LE or they get into someone's messages who doesn't encrypt (another thing we need is the ability to bulk delete messages), and they could easily link the two and get you.  Here is the article I was talking about:  CLEARNET:  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/09/05/follow-the-bitcoins-how-we-got-busted-buying-drugs-on-silk-roads-black-market/",""

Obviously I know the anonymous method will probably take more time, to get rid of them and then get the cash. I need to know how I can go about setting a way to cash out that doesn't cost too much and is safe. I am willing to to take a little more time to cash out if it means protecting myself more. I recently got a nice email service which automatically encrypts ppl's mail even if they don't use PGP, so I have to decrypt even spam mail, and it's not in the US! But that costs a little bit of money (btc actually, to stay anonymous) but it's been worth the money, and it has it's own built in VPN and a bunch of features like creating alias emails up to 25. Anyways the only way I know I can do things like anonymously is stuff like localbitcoins, but that just freaks me out because you never actually know if who is behind the scenes, and sometimes people want to meet up (I honestly don't know how it works), but something about it just seems off.  I can easily understand why you wouldn't want to post your method where anyone could see it, but I'd appreciate it if you could PM me (encrypt if you like), but I have been trying to do everything to be as anonymous as I can, but I know I can do more  to protect myself, just not sure what!? I had two ""lost"" packages in a short period which has never happened before and made me switch up a few things like location, packaging, etc. They could've just got lost because they recently raised priority shipping cost for flat rate priority envelopes and more of flat rate boxes and I'm not positive I had the new shipping cost, so that COULD be it, but usually they allow the receiver to pay the remainder of postage.  Sorry for the long message but obviously protecting our identities is probably the cardinal rule whe dealing with SR, especially vending. So I would like to know more about the method you use.

A user should be given the choice to acquire a new BTC address when ever they choose to do so. There are work a rounds for this but I agree with you about SR removing static BTC addresses from each account and allowing the account holder to generate new ones as needed.     HighGirl, that's way too much information to post on a public drug forum. You were going well until you said ""which I then move to an identity verified wallet so I can sell them.""  Sounds like you need to research some other methods of cashing out your coins other than selling them via an ""identity verified wallet"". You also need to keep all your BTC activity over the Tor network and that includes acquiring any Wallets you use, generating new BTC addresses as required and using different I.P addresses for each transaction you complete. Always stick with an .onion tumbler and avoid any clearnet tumbling services like the plague. Logs should be purged every 24hrs or so (I know they do that at HelixBitcoinCleaner - http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion). I'm not too sure about the other .onion tumbling services but being a hidden service on the Tor network and mixing coins from anonymous individuals who in all probability, earned them via illegal means, one would think they wouldn't be storing logs for any great length of time. I could be wrong but it wouldn't be wise for them to store logs any longer than 24 hrs max.  Cashing out Bitcoins is something that needs to be learned and researched. There are a variety of ways to do it however one needs to cover all their bases and educate themselves on the pro's and con's of each method you find and mix it up regularly by constantly changing things around.  Just changing BTC addresses won't achieve the same result as an .onion mixer would. It will however add another layer of security to the process you've adopted. Your best defence against anything DM related is to ensure your top priority is to protect your anonymity and not come to the attention of LE for anything.

However, some courts have found that in some circumstances, the government  may be allowed to introduce a suspect's silence as evidence of guilt.  The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas has held in Salinas v. Texas* that  Mr. Salinas' refusal to answer certain questions in a pre-arrest,  pre-Miranda interview were not protected by the Fifth Amendment. You can  read all the documents at SCOTUSblog.  The courts have previously determined that if someone is formally placed  under arrest (or if they are informed of their rights), their Fifth  Amendment protections would be preserved. Crimcourts has some concern that  if someone's silence can be used against them, regardless at what stage of  a proceeding, then they are almost compelled to talk. That is, the suspect  is given a choice to answer, or to have that silence used against them at  trial. If they are to be punished for being silent, their testimony is  compelled to some degree. Different courts have ruled differently on the  issue, and the resulting conflict in the law was likely a prompt for the  U.S. Supreme Court to accept the case to review and rule definitively on  the issue.  *Salinas v.

","Quote from: GGGreenbud on December 05, 2013, 03:44:12 pm   Does anyone want to know the MOST COMMON form of interrogation, and how to avoid it?        Pride.  They use your pride against you, and your ego.   First, they get you to say something, then, they accuse you of lying, which is not only a crime, but also an attack on your character.       95%+ of the people they interrogate, when accused of being a liar, will immediately spill their guts,  or make up a story, which can then be used to further extract info.   Finally, they get the person to the ""prove it, then"" phase, where they try to get you to sell them on your story with evidence.  PEOPLE work     for the police, the police are fucking lazy, you don't have to work that hard, when you can get people to work against their own best interests, and incriminate themselves.  We have the 5th amendment, and all you have to do is shut up for it to work.  Don't threaten them, don't take poison, don't get hostile, and sure as hell, don't fucking lie, or try to explain anything, because your natural instincts of self-preservation can be used against you.  This is all you need to know.  Many years ago, I was once in a situation where I was placed under arrest, and my then-partner was told that I was going to jail, so she implicated me to keep her ass from going to jail as well.   After I was released, the cop told her that I wasn't going to jail at all, he was fucking trolling and got lucky with her.  Never believe a cop, they lie for a living, they could tell you that you're doing life, fuck 'em, lawyer up, and they can eat a dick.Well said, to some it up for the lazy people. Keep your mouth shut. They only things you should be saying are your name (you legally have too) and that you want an attorney."

The filings show the FBI built its case in part by executing a search warrant on a Gmail account used by the counterfeiters, where they found that orders for forged cards were being sent to a TorMail e-mail account: âplatplus@tormail.net.âActing on that lead in September, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the TorMail account, and then accessed it from the bureauâs own copy of âdata and information from the TorMail e-mail server, including the content of TorMail e-mail accounts,â according to the complaint (.pdf) sworn out by U.S. Postal Inspector Eric Malecki.The tactic suggests the FBI is adapting to the age of big-data with an NSA-style collect-everything approach, gathering information into a virtual lock box, and leaving it there until it can obtain specific authority to tap it later. Thereâs no indication that the FBI searched the trove for incriminating evidence before getting a warrant.

By ""bitcoin withdrawal"" we are referring to transactions from a MtGox bitcoin wallet to an external bitcoin address. Bitcoin transactions to any MtGox bitcoin address, and currency withdrawals (Yen, Euro, etc) are not affected by this issue.  The problem we have identified is not limited to MtGox, and affects all transactions where Bitcoins are being sent to a third party. We believe that the changes required for addressing this issue will be positive over the long term for the whole community. As a result we took the necessary action of suspending bitcoin withdrawals until this technical issue has been resolved.   Addressing Transaction Malleability MtGox has detected unusual activity on its Bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of transactions which need to be examined more closely.    Non-technical Explanation:  A bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur. Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded correctly, the bitcoins may be resent. MtGox is working with the Bitcoin core development team and others to mitigate this issue.   Technical Explanation: Bitcoin transactions are subject to a design issue that has been largely ignored, while known to at least a part of the Bitcoin core developers and mentioned on the BitcoinTalk forums. This defect, known as ""transaction malleability"" makes it possible for a third party to alter the hash of any freshly issued transaction without invalidating the signature, hence resulting in a similar transaction under a different hash. Of course only one of the two transactions can be validated. However, if the party who altered the transaction is fast enough, for example with a direct connection to different mining pools, or has even a small amount of mining power, it can easily cause the transaction hash alteration to be committed to the blockchain.  The bitcoin api ""sendtoaddress"" broadly used to send bitcoins to a given bitcoin address will return a transaction hash as a way to track the transaction's insertion in the blockchain. Most wallet and exchange services will keep a record of this said hash in order to be able to respond to users should they inquire about their transaction. It is likely that these services will assume the transaction was not sent if it doesn't appear in the blockchain with the original hash and have currently no means to recognize the alternative transactions as theirs in an efficient way.  This means that an individual could request bitcoins from an exchange or wallet service, alter the resulting transaction's hash before inclusion in the blockchain, then contact the issuing service while claiming the transaction did not proceed. If the alteration fails, the user can simply send the bitcoins back and try again until successful.  We believe this can be addressed by using a different hash for transaction tracking purposes. While the network will continue to use the current hash for the purpose of inclusion in each block's Merkle Tree, the new hash's purpose will be to track a given transaction and can be computed and indexed by hashing the exact signed string via SHA256 (in the same way transactions are currently hashed).  This new transaction hash will allow signing parties to keep track of any transaction they have signed and can easily be computed, even for past transactions.  We have discussed this solution with the Bitcoin core developers and will allow Bitcoin withdrawals again once it has been approved and standardized.   In the meantime, exchanges and wallet services - and any service sending coins directly to third parties - should be extremely careful with anyone claiming their transaction did not go through.  Note that this will also affect any other crypto-currency using the same transaction scheme as Bitcoin.   Conclusion To put things in perspective, it's important to remember that Bitcoin is a very new technology and still very much in its early stages. What MtGox and the Bitcoin community have experienced in the past year has been an incredible and exciting challenge, and there is still much to do to further improve.   MtGox will resume bitcoin withdrawals to outside wallets once the issue outlined above has been properly addressed in a manner that will best serve our customers.  More information on the status of this issue will be released as soon as possible.   We thank you for taking the time to read this, and especially for your patience.   Best Regards, MtGox Team ",""

I've been browsing the forums looking for a solution to an issue I'm having but so far have had no luck so here I am.  I'm looking for a way to use pgp encryption with my iphone.  I was a security idiot child when I got it and didn't know how vulnerable it is so until I can afford to upgrade I'd like to keep communications as private as possible.  I've looked into various end to end encryption apps but the majority of my friends don't want the hassle of using a third party app for messaging so I thought it would be easier to get folks on board if they only had to integrate something like pgp into their existing email.  I found oPenGP on the app store but I don't think it's capable of creating private and public keys (it can only import and I'm not certain it imported my private key via itunes, which I'd rather not have to do anyway).  So finally, my question is does anyone know of a good stand alone PGP app for iPhone that can create private/public keys that will also be compatible with whatever other PGP service my droid user friends might go with?

Only an idea!","Discussion/Security","I think you misunderstood what I was saying, it may very well be that I wasn't clear in which case I apologise, but let me try and clear up that statement (which by the way isn't a really helpful critique of my post or idea, though I too am a massive pedant on forums lol):  My point is this: Having access to a private key is useless. If I had an anonymous PGP Private key but did not know who's it was it would be absolutely meaningless and useless to me, I couldn't do anything, I would have to brute force every PGP message I could find in the blind hope I found one and that is to borrow a term 'an astronomical number'. Remember why I made my point in the first place, the statement is useless out of context. The app would hold a private key against a username, I was saying if that username had no link to your SR account at all, then even if someone were to break into my server and get them all, they would be worthless. My point was, I thought, quite clearly that a malicious party getting hold of a private key would only be a problem if they also knew who's it was and had a message that they KNEW was encrypted with the corresponding public key. The second part therefore was saying, if someone has access to your messages on your SilkRoad account then they must have had access to your silkroad account or the whole silk road server, in which case the security of my server would be relatively unimportant (i.e. you'd have bigger problems).  If you really feel the need for more pedantry and the suggestion that someone with a masters degree in cryptography might not understand the necessity or point to encryption then please feel free to PM me but can we keep this thread to ideas on possibly implementing this app or objections to the idea rather than picking on the semantics of the OP who is very likely using some of the narcotics he stocks and so doesn't triple proof his posts...  Sorry for that last little rant, I'm just slightly surprised at the direction this thread has taken. I don't mean any offense.",""

You are arguing with me about a part of the program that we almost immediately had agreed would not be feasible. We left the idea of server-side encryption or decryption in about 3 posts and instead decided that a client side auditable browser plugin or app would be used instead. The server's involvement would purely be to store a private key (and as many public keys you would like) with a username and password (and we can go into one-way hashing of salted passwords server side if you like). No messages would ever reach my server at all, and in fact I had even hinted as per my dissertation that not even entire keys would be kept by any single party. This is why I was frustrated in my last post and why I'm more frustrated now. Of course I understand that it would be pointless encrypting anything if a malevolent party had the means to decrypt it, that is self-evident. The reason I was trying to move on from that point was that it had been taken out of context and you've done it again, except this time you've spent a good deal of time picking at my post. I am NOT suggesting that security by anonymity is better than cryptography and that would be truly absurd.   I don't understand why this is still being talked about mate, I wanted to debate methods of making the concept usable by any means, not debate my own understanding of cryptography. I obviously can't prove my credentials on an anonymous forum but please don't call me a liar because we've started talking about semantics of my statements and my literal statement that a private key on its own is useless (and if you are arguing against that statement I'm totally lost as to why).",""

Where your profile details are not public, where only the people you designate can see your profile .. where you control the privacy settings, where your profile data is distributed and encrypted.

Imagine a central index of search terms, duplicated 20 or 100 times on central servers.  Imagine a simple web front-end that accesses one of the central index databases to return to you an appropriate listing of responses to your search terms.... and not a listing of responses that is corrupted by the advertising contracts that google has with various merchants and corporates.    In this scenario, a person's search history, is not a source of advertising hints, it's private, and unrecorded.  have a nice day .. and be happy   :-) ","I'm a software developer and after reading all the people struggling with PGP and people using iGolder I thought of an idea for a website.Basically, you would create an account and it would act like gpg4win GPA in that you could create keys, save public keys (with an alias) and encrypt/decrypt online.

It would be free of course and ad-free.Just wanted to get your thoughts?BL    p.s. my dissertation was on cryptography and secure e-voting. I'm pretty confident on my abilities to keep data private, but as I said, what data here would be harmful?"

"Silk Road 2 Forums","m0rph","29389","2014-03-02T07:38:25","Idea for PGP site, shoot me down if you like! Only an idea!","Discussion/Security"," No, I totally get what you are saying, you are just wrong.    Unless there are 2^x GPG messages (assuming brute force search is required, I'm not entirely certain that it would be unless you went about implementing it correctly, which you clearly cannot do), where X is the symmetric bit strength equivalent of the RSA key utilized, and each of the X messages has an equal probability of being the users, then you will be greatly damaging the security of users of your system if you rely on obscurity of ciphertexts. You know the users of your system will be using SR since you advertised it here, so we can ignore all other ciphertexts on the internet and focus on SR. Assuming even one million GPG encrypted messages go through SR every week, you would be able to find the ciphertexts that you can decrypt with private keys you have if you managed to compromise the SR server, as could anyone who could compromise your server and the SR server. Even if we assumed all GPG messages on the internet, there would no longer be anywhere near the security as if the private key was actually kept secret.    No then the security of your server and your legitimacy would be paramount because the security of every single message on SR encrypted with your service would depend on your single centralized server not being comrpomised and you not being malicious. If someone broke in your server and got them all they wouldn't be worthless, because now they only need to compromise the SR server to be able to decrypt all messages that were encrypted to users of your service. That is pretty worthwhile if anyone uses your service!    Don't bullshit me bro you obviously don't have a masters degree in cryptography because the obvious solution to the problem is symmetrically encrypting the private keys on your server with a password that is run through a PBKDF with the client side program to symmetrically decrypt the private key client side so your server only has ciphertexts of private keys on it. You know, like GPG already stores private keys client side. Why the fuck would anyone upload a plaintext private key to a remote server GPG doesn't even store plaintext private keys client side. Your design utilized security via obscurity, which is flawed and something anyone with a masters degree in crypto would have immediately realized, my suggestion would be a canonical way of doing it securely BY DESIGN, and as we all know security by design is the only true security. You managed to utilize security by policy and security by obscurity all in one go, a pretty shocking feat for someone with a masters degree in crypto. ","I think you misunderstood what I was saying, it may very well be that I wasn't clear in which case I apologise, but let me try and clear up that statement (which by the way isn't a really helpful critique of my post or idea, though I too am a massive pedant on forums lol):;My point is this:Having access to a private key is useless. If I had an anonymous PGP Private key but did not know who's it was it would be absolutely meaningless and useless to me, I couldn't do anything, I would have to brute force every PGP message I could find in the blind hope I found one and that is to borrow a term 'an astronomical number'. ;Remember why I made my point in the first place, the statement is useless out of context. The app would hold a private key against a username, I was saying if that username had no link to your SR account at all, then even if someone were to break into my server and get them all, they would be worthless. My point was, I thought, quite clearly that a malicious party getting hold of a private key would only be a problem if they also knew who's it was and had a message that they KNEW was encrypted with the corresponding public key. The second part therefore was saying, if someone has access to your messages on your SilkRoad account then they must have had access to your silkroad account or the whole silk road server, in which case the security of my server would be relatively unimportant (i.e. you'd have bigger problems).;If you really feel the need for more pedantry and the suggestion that someone with a masters degree in cryptography might not understand the necessity or point to encryption then please feel free to PM me but can we keep this thread to ideas on possibly implementing this app or objections to the idea rather than picking on the semantics of the OP who is very likely using some of the narcotics he stocks and so doesn't triple proof his posts...Sorry for that last little rant, I'm just slightly surprised at the direction this thread has taken. I don't mean any offense."
"Silk Road 2 Forums","m0rph","29389","2014-03-02T08:11:54","Idea for PGP site, shoot me down if you like! Only an idea!","Discussion/Security"," A gun by itself is useless but I'm not going to hand one to a spree killer. Sure authentication to the server is a good idea, and in that context you could use a salted hash of a password. But you seem to think that you need to have a plaintext private key on your server. That is not the case. The private key can be generated client side initially and then symmetrically encrypted with the key derived from a password passed to a PBKDF. The resulting ciphertext could be uploaded to your server. Now your server doesn't have the private key. It has the ciphertext of the private key. Without the password you cannot even get access to the private key. The password is only known by the user. The private key is only decrypted client side. That immediately increases the security of your system from ""I am not an attacker and I don't pwn SR server"" to ""I am not an attacker and I don't pwn SR server and I can't crack the users password to decrypt their private key"". ","Have you read all of my posts? You are arguing with me about a part of the program that we almost immediately had agreed would not be feasible. We left the idea of server-side encryption or decryption in about 3 posts and instead decided that a client side auditable browser plugin or app would be used instead. The server's involvement would purely be to store a private key (and as many public keys you would like) with a username and password (and we can go into one-way hashing of salted passwords server side if you like). No messages would ever reach my server at all, and in fact I had even hinted as per my dissertation that not even entire keys would be kept by any single party. This is why I was frustrated in my last post and why I'm more frustrated now. Of course I understand that it would be pointless encrypting anything if a malevolent party had the means to decrypt it, that is self-evident. The reason I was trying to move on from that point was that it had been taken out of context and you've done it again, except this time you've spent a good deal of time picking at my post. I am NOT suggesting that security by anonymity is better than cryptography and that would be truly absurd. I don't understand why this is still being talked about mate, I wanted to debate methods of making the concept usable by any means, not debate my own understanding of cryptography. I obviously can't prove my credentials on an anonymous forum but please don't call me a liar because we've started talking about semantics of my statements and my literal statement that a private key on its own is useless (and if you are arguing against that statement I'm totally lost as to why)."

To see the effect of this bug, following the steps below:  (Step 1) Start with a clean slate.  mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.orig (this renames your current .gnupg directory so that the following steps do not polute your gnupg keyrings)  (Step 2)   Copy and paste the following PUBLIC KEY into a file called SOMEONE.pubkey.asc  then import the public key into your public key keyring gpg --import SOMEONE.pubkey.asc  -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG v1  mI0EUziCEAEEANBJI+7rUJMZFUhc9mxtvsQx4yQyMBJaZpLpDLGLjPXLLHzXPREE yPjaDGPsclc3Y7ORWKtalArEaIgJCtaOCX9tnzHzmGPGfppbJC63pcizCAIe3/aR w94TcOZVEnO35b9sszBa+iStQIg241FdqX58a7kr5aLAqQeQkct0KHcVABEBAAG0 B1NPTUVPTkWIuAQTAQIAIgUCUziCEAIbAwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgEC F4AACgkQPiIRM3cupmpDxgP9Hu0QxTG3elivR6s5E1+cajpSXwBfVoipTMJVa6d1 B/v72YKj6D20RmARcSpoQlxrFDS4JDEn8Tq6+AyY4Kk5bPPPsQ9urN0RKJKVTmtR 4nZXnvleiR1KcfPLRthvWNI7ra8+o5oavszNFuRiVWF4g5ad/YgXOP4ZvuxDSlQp eG24jQRTOIIQAQQAp9RtLp9hIOqDqBvCgkCVE4R8lkStW9bhcRA2/TI5BAsKHTLh 3/2H6/arF8lDFyo8ZAtVfGrfepWFFNYPNgJfGrmVAftsAWDPsq5EWCVdEGAFSJUP FLqrIYWjqAIOLzyl9wdEt4TPyFzA/UsW1/fW7MQuWJRaN1sa70FsdUf9XK8AEQEA AYifBBgBAgAJBQJTOIIQAhsMAAoJED4iETN3LqZqMHUD+gPUiqD6vlKj2BiVna2B gZgjn6hnVjMzoRwjg2ByVJZB0CA4R8lWDtkTMp4+Bh9ZkzzfcAcG32Jj292Kd8kE 1NKNv1UdazuBFO1CMt5I7sDujYMzL+VhUSGlQ0fNNAwhA32Y90Kot0y1hABERiII sklBWJT1KFtoucdXVsf6x7g/ =gwNN -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----  After you have imported the SOMEONE public key you can check  to see that it was imported correctly as follows:  $ gpg --list-keys    pub   1024R/772EA66A 2014-03-30 uid                  SOMEONE sub   1024R/2B02EBF5 2014-03-30  looks good !  (Step 3)  I then create a public/private key pair with which to communicate with SOMEONE. gpg --gen-key  Select RSA/RSA encryption options for encryption and signing (1024 bit key) Select an expiry date of your choice. Select myName for the 'real name' select for_SOMENAME@domain.com as the email address Select myName as the comment.  After the keys have been created you can re-check your public keyring as shown below:  $ gpg --list-keys   #  PUBLIC KEYS  pub   1024R/7EAEB199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08] uid                  myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@domain.com> sub   1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]  pub   1024R/772EA66A 2014-03-30 uid                  SOMEONE sub   1024R/2B02EBF5 2014-03-30  gpg --list-secret-keys    sec   1024R/7EAEB199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08] uid                  myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@domain.com> ssb   1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30  So you have your 'myName' secret and public keys And you have only the public key for SOMEONE.  (Step 4) Put some prophetic text into a file for a test encryption: echo 'The collapse of the petro dollar: collapse of USD' > file.txt  (Step 5) Attempt to encrypt this file gpg -a --output output.enc --recipient SOMEONE --encrypt file.txt  (Step 6) Now decrypt the output.enc file to see which keys it's  been encrypted with:  $ gpg --decrypt output.enc You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@domain.com>"" 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30 (main key ID 7EAEB199)  gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30       ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@domain.com>""  What you don't see is a line telling you it's been encrypted with the key for SOMENAME. You should see, but don't see, a line that says: gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 772EA66A, created 2014-03-30  And therein lies the rub ... (or bug, if you prefer)  What gpg appears to be doing, is selecting the first match for the --recipient argument that appears in the public keyring. It doesn't select _all_ keys that match, it seems to select only  the first key that matches.   (Step 7 ) Clean up and restore your original keyrings) mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.SOMENAME mv ~/.gnupg.orig ~/.gnupg     So what can you do to prevent this happening to you. 1.  don't use short key id names like:  THE or EEN or ING etc. Or anything else that is likely be a subset of a larger name. 2.  specify your encryption recipients using the key IDs  not the names on the keys eg: gpg -a --output output.enc --recipient 772EA66A --encrypt file.txt  Have a nice day ... and be happy  playground :-)",""

Axolotl's 'Quoting' solution. 2. The 'Email' solution.  1. Testing the quoting solution. -------------------------------- The 'Quoting Solution' suggests that the substring matching problem when processing the --recipient argument is solved by simply putting the key name in quotes, as shown below:  $ gpg -a -o output.enc -r ""SOMEONE"" -e file.txt  ~/gpg $ gpg -d output.enc  You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>"" 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30 (main key ID 7EAEB199)  gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID A16277D8, created 2014-03-30       ""myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion>"" collapse of the Petro dollar: collapse of USD  Still no mention of this file being encrypted with SOMEONE's key.  The quoting solution, at least with my version of gpg, doesn't work.  My version is: 1.4.16  (that's on cygwin) Perhaps it works with other versions.  2. Testing the Email Address solution. -------------------------------------- The 'Email Address' solution suggests that the way to  avoid the substring matching problem is to specify the key by specifying the email address presented on the key in toto. For example: $ gpg -a -o output.enc -r SOMEONE@domain.com -e file.txt  where the available public keys are: $ gpg --list-keys  pub   1024R/7EAEB199 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08] uid                  myName (myName) <for_SOMEONE@darkweb.onion> sub   1024R/A16277D8 2014-03-30 [expires: 2014-07-08]  pub   1024R/8A0290BA 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09] uid                  SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com> sub   1024R/6022F39B 2014-03-31 [expires: 2014-07-09]  This _does_ solve the problem:  $ gpg -d output.enc gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 6022F39B, created 2014-03-31       ""SOMEONE <SOMEONE@domain.com>"" gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available  This is the expected response. :-)  So we have two solutions to the substring matching problem when the --recipient string is processed: 1)  specify the recipient public key with the key ID: 6022F39B 2)  specify the recipient public key with the full email address: SOMEONE@domain.com  Axolotl's quoting solution didn't work for me, but i may work for other versions of gpg or on a different platform.  Any other solutions.. or perspectives on this problem, are warmly welcomed.  Have a nice day .. and be happy :-)  playground.","Excellent advice.

A university or college is a private institution and a student is not protected by laws (like labour laws...) in a traditional sense; a university or college doesn't need to have the ""right"" to kick you out.  They can, and will, boot you out for shipping drugs to your dorm whether or not you are convicted or not, especially in a country as intolerant towards drug use as the US. As far as I know, when you live in a dorm, you sign agreements as to how you will conduct yourself and one of those points is to not use drugs/store drugs/ or have drug paraphenalia in your dorm. Don't bother risking this. People get expelled from university for having weed in their dorms. Dorms can be notoriously restrictive."

Consider the extra cost an investment in your freedom. Getting kicked out of school should be the least of your worries should you get caught. Knowingfully receiving drugs in the mail is a FEDERAL offense. Keep that in mind..  Your next option should be an alternate drop as suggested, like those already suggested. Get a fake ID and grab you a PO box. Im sure out of state ID's wouldn't throw up any red flags near a university like it might otherwise. College campus mailrooms are often run by other students, which appears true in your case, so they aren't exactly ignorant of SR and mailing drugs. This also likely applies to postal centers in the immediate area. Keep that in mind..  You final option should be to receive only envelopes if you do decide to take the extreme risk. Ask your vendors explicity if they can ship your orders in an regular or flat rate envelope. Verify beforehand, and confirm if needed.  The overall concept is your dorm address, BAD BAD BAD idea.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","ZergRush","46124","2014-07-16T02:42:56","Advice on dealing","Discussion/Security","My advice if you decide to sell at festies is to get to the festival as early as possible and make your rounds in the areas where people just set up camp within the last few hours. This way people haven't already got their goods from other sellers so you will move your product faster and it is more unlikely that there will be undercovers while everyone is still getting set up and settled in.   Focus on big groups of people as you will sell more product in one stop this way and it's more unlikely that there will be an undercover amongst a groups of 10 friends. Don't stop at every tent either. Don't walk by every tent and say the same thing over and over out loud like I see lots of people do. Walk by 15 or 20 tents, then find a nice size camp or group of people, and ask quietly. If they're interested, ask to sit down and try to do so where you're not easily seen by passerbys, but make it look like you are just one of the group. If they say no, keep moving and wait another couple minutes of walking before you try another group.   Not a good idea to sell from your camp either, though it may be tempting when people walk by asking for the exact chemical you have to sell.  Have a friend with you to make the rounds who can be your eyes.  If you're selling to a group of people and someone walks up asking if anyone has anything to sell, don't offer. At a fest this year this dude sold some weed to our camping neighbors. Two days later we ran into him and he told us he got popped this way...he was selling to a group, then two dudes came up and asked if anyone had weed to sell, the people he was selling to said that he did and the dude was hesitant at first, but then said he did and the undercover grabbed him and flashed a badge. took his weed and close to 2 grand, and maybe a citation but can't remember.  So, also don't carry all of your cash or product with you. After a few deals, go back and stash you stuff safely so you don't lose it all if you run into an undercover.  Don't look like you're holding, dress casually, look clean-cut.",""
"Silk Road 2 Forums","DoctaShwartz","46124","2014-07-16T03:59:57","Advice on dealing","Discussion/Security"," Counterfeit drug laws vary state to state, but often times have an even worse penalty than had you sold the real thing. Look up your state's laws.  Remember not everyone will want a full vial. I would suggest volumetrically measuring and making 25-drop vials from each, and if someone wants more they just have to buy a second quantity or however much in increments of 25.  I would carry a test kit with you and offer to test it, people get sketched out buying acid.  Selling xtal requires an expensive scale ($800+) to be able to go to .0001g (100mcg). A +/- 3mg error is a lot to consider with small jewelry scales. I wouldn't order this on Amazon.  You'll have to research encryption apps, as I'm not familiar of open source ones for iPhone. TextSecure is popular, but I'm not aware if it's out for iPhone. Silent Circle (I think?) is another but may also be closed sourced.  You could learn to lay your own sheets (House of Spirit would be happy to teach you if you buy xtal from her) or suspend your own vials with LSD. There's a few good guides around, I think one is in JesusofRave's review thread here on the first page of it.   You could make many vials easily, just suspend the desired quantity/vial (10mg if 100mcg drops and you want 100) and multiply that by the amount of vials you want. I.E. 250mg in x amount of solvent (number of solvent in each vial x # of vials) and disperse the given amount of solution to each vial. This gives you the freedom to make 25, 50 and 100 drop vials simply by drawing up less solution to dispense in one vial.  As far as getting stuff into festivals, YMMV. It's best to practice as good security as you can even if you know security isn't tight at a given festival. I'm quite the fan of buying a boxed food product with a foil bag inside (opaque). Open the bag carefully along the seal seam, place goodies inside (maybe eat some to make room  ) and heat seal with an impulse sealer. Then, glue the top of the cardboard box down. 100% stealth.   ","I am getting a better grasp now. This is really helping.We use Wickr, I had no idea it was closed source and should've researched further into that before choosing to use it. Are there any Iphone apps that you would recommend that are open source and the crypto com. are satisfied with?And I have not read about XMPP + OTR , not sure what that is but I will look into getting it for Iphone.He does know my name/contact info, and we have mutual friends.I will definitely be utilizing the dead drops, It adds another layer of security there.One other option I want to open up ( after I have bought a few vials from my supplier ) , is selling crystal. Which means I have to get a few thousand $ into BTC, another obstacle but would be worth it. That will only work if I am able to work my way up to higher level. Assuming the DNM sell crystal cheaper than what these guys can get through their connects, I feel I should be able to make a good amount off each order of crystal, what do you think?As far as laying myself, that is not in my best interest right now, maybe someday though. I am still working my way into these circles. I want to have as little contact with this as possible with bulk, and using the dead drop method is perfect. At this point, On TOP of having a few people buying vials off me and the main guy buying (hopefully ) a good amount somewhat consistently,  bringing 5-6 vials to a festival also to just find a few people who want to buy would be another way to make a quick $1000-2000 profit. But then that comes with keeping them hidden through the entrance, and having to drive them up there.Zerg Rush thank you. I am really hoping that I could sell vials of clean L for $500-600. Especially selling MULTIPLE vials, finding buyers might be tricky. I am clean cut. I am gonna utilize all of your advice while I make rounds. If I sell just a few vials I will be set. Do you know how much people would be willing to pay per vial?  I just had a great idea. What if I carried Vials filled with water around with me. I find a buyer and do the deal. If all goes well and no badge is pulled , THEN I get the REAL vials that is being carried by my buddy( who will not be in the vicinity until the deal is done) and give it to them. That way, I will know if I have just sold to an undercover. But if it was an undercover I just sold water filled vials to, I am assuming I could still get into some type of trouble?"

You can see how this scales up in profit.You can still clear huge margins moving bulk and it's a hell of a lot safer than moving petty deals to people you don't know.OPSEC plays into this so that a dealer doesn't flip on you if you get busted, but that's a different conversation."

That 250g, when I get it, will get me 8 ounces I can sell for 1100 (8800), a half ounce I'll sell for $650, plus 12 grams -- 2 of which I'll keep to myself and the other ten I'll sell for about $600 to close friends capped up.  I now have $10,500. You can see how this scales up in profit.  You can still clear huge margins moving bulk and it's a hell of a lot safer than moving petty deals to people you don't know.  OPSEC plays into this so that a dealer doesn't flip on you if you get busted, but that's a different conversation.","Avoid selling personal amounts of drugs as much as possible, just go straight to wholesale.   Or raise enough money selling personal amounts of drugs to your friends then go to wholesale.   "
"Silk Road 2 Forums","DoctaShwartz","46124","2014-07-16T02:08:36","Advice on dealing","Discussion/Security"," A few words I have to offer you:  While you may think LSD is inherently safer than dealing M (it may be) it shouldn't make a difference what chemical you're selling, to be honest, if you OPSEC is in order.  You say you only communicate over encrypted messaging. Could you go more into detail? iMessage is supposedly end-to-end encrypted, but I wouldn't recommend dealing from it. Wickr is third party and closed source, using encryption algorithms that many in the crypto community deem to be insufficient.  If you're using mobile to communicate, I would suggest using XMPP + OTR, perhaps routed through Tor if you can. If your client has access to e-mail, I would recommend using something like riseup.net accounts created over Tor, logged in with NoScript enabled, and using PGP end-to-end encryption. Bitmessage may also be an option. I would recommend each of them in that order.  JM covered you on labelling your vials as test kits or similar. I'll go further into detail about how to orchestrate trades.  Perhaps you should look into accepting only Bitcoin and using dead drops. It seems like you know this guy IRL though, but what it offers is a way to orchestrate a trade, receive payment, and drop off product without ever showing face. This means you won't get robbed, etc. A dead drop is when you receive money first, then drop the product off at a random, hidden location (think a random nearby playground at night, just be careful as these do get patrolled by police) and tell your buyer to retrieve it there by giving him the location once you leave. This would mean change up drop points frequently so that your movement isn't predicted.  If this guy knows where you live/your name and contact info, forget that part. Just hope he wouldn't flip on you if caught (and he very well could) when LE pressure him about sentencing. This would mean other elements of OPSEC are necessary. In this case, keep no product at home in case you're robbed, and never refer to each other on a name basis through communication. If LE intercepts his communications with you, make sure anything said between both parties doesn't tie identities. This would include car descriptions, etc. That way, if he's caught and taken for questioning and drops your name, LE can come knock on your door and find nothing. I'd suggest deleting archived messages as well, for the same reason.  If he flips and becomes a CI and they perform a controlled buy, you have slight deniability if nothing is done face-to-face (Bitcoin, dead drops). If they get a warrant to survey your movements via GPS tracking, and you are proven to be at a certain place you designate for a controlled buy, you're fucked. Leave any GPS device including you phone in the car and physically walk a good distance before dropping off. Maybe get a bike and ride around to drop off and then disclose the location after you get back. Again, no GPS data.  Also, don't be stupid and carry more than was agreed on for the deal. If you get popped, again be sure to have nothing at home (store elsewhere, fuck even bury it in the woods) in case of a warrant.  This may seem extraneous, but I'm trying to point out potential factors that could do you in. ----  On the topic of your product, LSD in my experience doesn't tend to sell as fast as other drugs. If that's OK with you, then proceed. LSD sells slowly, so he may take a while to re-up.  Once you build volume, try checking out bulk discounts from both your supplier and DNMs. A gram of LSD would produce 100 vials at ~100ug and certain xtal can range from $12,500/g (silver) to $20,000/g (fluff) in that bulk level.  If you get a gram for $12,500, let's say, and suspend your own vials, then you could profit $50k. But remember you'd likely need to give bulk discounts as well to move that kind of amount quickly. Even at $350/vial, $12,500 can turn into $35k. Just food for thought. At that point, I'd become a DNM seller, but that's just me lol.","This is exactly what I needed DoctaShwartz.I have a high up dealer, who wants to buy mainly vials off me. I am only dealing with this one guy, who I have known for quite a while and trust.I want to stick to LSD. In my opinion it is much safer to deal with than M.I can get vials for about $325, each one I sell for $500 will be $175 profit. If He buys 5 vials that is about $875 profit, and I will have $2500. It seems too easy.. I am currently learning about the US justice system and understanding police and how to avoid all encounters and knowing my rights/proper action if something happened. We only communicate through encrypted messaging.Thanks for all the insight, do you have any knowledge you can give me on proper OPSEC while dealing?I don't talk business on the phone or through text.I understand that experience is really the main thing for me to learn how this game works, but hopefully you can shine some more light on this for me.I want this to be absolutely sealproof and for me to expand my understanding of all this as wide as possible.

We use Wickr, I had no idea it was closed source and should've researched further into that before choosing to use it. Are there any Iphone apps that you would recommend that are open source and the crypto com. are satisfied with?  And I have not read about XMPP + OTR , not sure what that is but I will look into getting it for Iphone.  He does know my name/contact info, and we have mutual friends. I will definitely be utilizing the dead drops, It adds another layer of security there.   One other option I want to open up ( after I have bought a few vials from my supplier ) , is selling crystal. Which means I have to get a few thousand $ into BTC, another obstacle but would be worth it. That will only work if I am able to work my way up to higher level. Assuming the DNM sell crystal cheaper than what these guys can get through their connects, I feel I should be able to make a good amount off each order of crystal, what do you think?  As far as laying myself, that is not in my best interest right now, maybe someday though.   I am still working my way into these circles. I want to have as little contact with this as possible with bulk, and using the dead drop method is perfect.   At this point, On TOP of having a few people buying vials off me and the main guy buying (hopefully ) a good amount somewhat consistently,  bringing 5-6 vials to a festival also to just find a few people who want to buy would be another way to make a quick $1000-2000 profit. But then that comes with keeping them hidden through the entrance, and having to drive them up there.   Zerg Rush thank you. I am really hoping that I could sell vials of clean L for $500-600. Especially selling MULTIPLE vials, finding buyers might be tricky.  I am clean cut. I am gonna utilize all of your advice while I make rounds. If I sell just a few vials I will be set. Do you know how much people would be willing to pay per vial?    I just had a great idea. What if I carried Vials filled with water around with me. I find a buyer and do the deal. If all goes well and no badge is pulled , THEN I get the REAL vials that is being carried by my buddy( who will not be in the vicinity until the deal is done) and give it to them. That way, I will know if I have just sold to an undercover. But if it was an undercover I just sold water filled vials to, I am assuming I could still get into some type of trouble? ",""

I personally haven't, but I've seen this process be done.  Dead drops (for enough weight) usually mean you have to go pick up a truck in a parking lot and drive it to a garage and, quite literally, tear the whole car apart. Truck beds can hold upwards of 50 kilos under the liner.  I suppose they factor the vehicle as a cost of doing business, but then again it's probably stolen anyways.

It was on the virtual drug marketplace, authorities said, that a Delaware physician sold hundreds of prescription drugs illegally and shipped them to Central Florida, throughout the U.S. and to people in more than 15 other countries.  On Thursday, agents arrested the doctor, 32-year-old Olivia Bolles, near her home, and prosecutors in Orlando unsealed a 54-page criminal complaint detailing the allegations against her.  Bolles' case is the first of its kind in Central Florida involving Silk Road, a website for global drug dealers and users who could sell and buy anything from cocaine to methamphetamine anonymously.  ""Dr. Bolles was a respectable doctor by day and a drug trafficker by night when she went incognito on the underground website Silk Road to illegally sell highly abused pharmaceutical medications,"" said Special Agent in Charge Mark R. Trouville of the DEA's Miami division. The arrest comes one month after federal agents shut down Silk Road and charged its founder, a 29-year-old former physics student from San Francisco, with building a drug empire with an estimated $1.2 billion in sales.  Orlando-based agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Bolles, who was a pharmacy technician before earning her medical degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia, operated on Silk Road under the name ""MDPro,"" according to the criminal complaint. Bolles is not licensed to dispense controlled substances such as painkillers.  Federal documents show agents found more than 600 drug sales between MDPro and Silk Road users.   ""Dr. Bolles' greed became a concern for public safety, and now she will face the consequences of her actions,"" Trouville said. According to the criminal complaint, DEA agents bought oxycodone, Xanax, Adderall, hash oil and other drugs from ""MDPro"" from June to August.  When one of those orders arrived at an undercover address in Central Florida in June, an invoice for a ""Sample Order"" of ""Sour Patch watermelon candy"" was inside.  There was an envelope in the box that contained a sealed box of Sour Patch candy. Inside the box of candy was a plastic baggie containing four Oxycontin tablets, the complaint said.  In another order, a purchase of Valium was concealed as ""Airheads"" candy, and the box also included an invoice for a ""Sample Order"" of ""Airheads.""  Other orders were disguised as Life Savers gummies and Jolly Rancher candies.  Agents reviewed Bolles' bank accounts and her eBay account, which showed she bought items commonly used in drug manufacturing, including formaldehyde and products used to make hash oils, such as chloroform.  Agents searched Bolles' home in Newark, Del., on Thursday. It wasn't immediately known what authorities found, but her roommate Alexandra Gold, also a physician, was arrested on drug charges.  Bolles will be brought to Orlando for future court proceedings. If convicted of illegally distributing controlled substances, she faces up to 20 years in federal prison.   apavuk@tribune.com or 407-420-5735  ",""

The situation is fucking weird, but I assure you, it's very real, and it is not SR or drug related.  I need to be slim on some details in case the freak in question is monitoring this forum (somewhat unlikely, but you never know).  Short version: Had a pretty good friend for a few years, we did a lot of RL biz together. A few months ago I found out he was setting me up for a robbery. I also realized he is a psychopath. I'm not just throwing around words, here. He has 8 out of ten personality traits for anti-social personality disorder. I didn't realize it before because HE'S A PSYCHOPATH. (not all psychopaths are serial killers, let's just get hat out of the way right now). Unfortunatley for him, my uncle is also a psychopath, so I'm not a complete amateur in this area. Once my ex-friend was comfortable that his con was firmly in motion he let down his guard a bit and that is how I figured it out.  When I busted him I called him out and cut him off. We have had zero contact since then.  Psycho then enlisted the help of a mutual friend (called ""apaths"" to use the correct lingo). I had known the apath for quite a while, so while a bit wary, did not feel he would do anything to further Psycho's aims. I was wrong (because I didn't then know about the psycho/apath relationship).  Within a few weeks the apath exposed himself because he's a fucking idiot. He was sent a very serious message, then disappeared.  The next day I started hearing from various friends of Psycho's, people I hadn't heard from in quite awhile. Psycho was obviously trying to establish another apath in my life. They were also sent very serious messages, and they disappeared.  All the random contacts stopped. Except for one.  This guy is someone I have done biz with in the past (I'll call him Bob). He knows my protocal: when I am ready to move I give him a call. I am all action and no talk.  Bob suddenly started calling to check on my status. This was random and very out of the ordinary. The second time he did it, I told him I am avoiding Psycho's associates for the time being and I would be in touch when I am ready to roll, as usual. He said he completely understood. But he has contacted me four times in the last few weeks. I realized today that every time he has contacted me, it has been within 24 hours of my stopping at a specific location. Sometimes I pick up cash from this location, sometimes I don't. I go there randomly when I happen to be in that part of town.  I'm pretty sure at this point that Psycho wants to rob me, and I'm pretty sure he's using Bob to find out if I have cash in hand. Bob may or may not know this, but I am certain that is what's going on. The timing of the calls is too suspicious.  I believe Psycho is using some sort of GPS monitoring to find out when I visit that location.  Here is my question: In the past, Psycho did put spyware on my phone. That phone was abandoned on a train and made a merry trip around the country before it finally died lol. I replaced with a brand new one. I'm pretty savvy, and I don't think he could remote install spyware without me catching it (in the past he had access to my phone, he hasn't had access to the new phone). The only other way I can *think of* that he may be monitoring me is some kind of GPS device on my car/cars. I have looked in and under the vehicles and don't see anything out of the ordinary, but I don't really know what I'm looking for, I only know what should be there, not what shouldn't, if that makes sense. I don't have a mechanic I trust with this, and I tried an RF detector, but my vehicles use RF to send signals to the dash, so that doesn't help.  If anyone can make some suggestions on what to look for and where, I would appreciate it. I've done the google search all morning and it hasn't been much help.  (And just to be clear, there hasn't been anything of value on me or in my house since this whole freak show started. I have put that word on the street, that's why I think he's using Bob).  I can use any and ALL advice, suggestions, etc. I am working, so I will check in every few hours to answer questions and follow up.  THANKS IN ADVANCE SR COMMUNITY!!!",""

Most (if not all now days) GPS devices have what is called sleep mode. For example after the car has remained still for let's say 2 minutes, the device goes to sleep. This is mainly to keep units that have their own battery source from going dead faster. Then when you drive again, the unit ""wakes up"" up so to speak. When this happens the unit will transmit constantly. That is how the tracking software works. Check out http://www.liveviewgps.net on your clear net browser.

Each frequency band will have a range, yet the jammer for that band will cover that entire range.  Only thing is now you need multiple band coverage.  And I guess those cigarette lighter jammers aren't $15 anymore...     Yeah.  I was reading through the cases on the FCC site.  Interesting stuff.  https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/jammer-enforcement  Sounds like you'd be OK as long as you don't crank up the signal full blast, don't have a routine that takes you past a major airport with it on, don't drive around with it always on, have a kill-switch in case you're pulled over, don't admit to having it, and don't let them search your vehicle.   All the cases seemed to be similar in that the driver admitted to owning it, left it plugged in when pulled over, and let them search the vehicle.   You could always just get one of the handheld versions, and if you see some dudes pointing yagi antennas at you, chuck the fucker out the window after making a quick turn or something where they don't see you.       I personally would love to have something like this 5 band jammer rigged up inside my vehicle... just turned up enough to engulf the vehicle.   http://www.jammer-store.com/rcj40-d-adjustable-five-band-gsm-gps-3g-wireless-jammer-blocker.html Or: http://www.aiswa.com/goods-8021-Multi-functional+3G+4G+Cell+Phone+Jammer+and+GPS+WiFi+Lojack+Jammer+.html That way you'd be covered from mostly everything. Not driving around with it constantly on, just only during sensitive movements.

","my only concern would be if attempting to jam a cell frequency, pretty much all cellphone data is transmitted in encrypted form no? possibly even the channel it's transmiting on (which might also change frequently i could imagine). jamming data/cell signals with 100% certainty might be harder than it seems, compared to GPS? (if that can truly even be accomplished with a $15 device?) ;after checking out a few stores today looking for a gps/rf/cell and/or any kind of frequency jammer, i came home empty handed, only to read up and find out that ANY sort of gps, cellphone, rf, ect jamming device is 100% illegal. in the US at least:*WARNING! GOVERNMENT WEBSITE!*: http://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/;although i did come home with a few other interesting devices, incliding an RF/bug detector."

I'm not familiar with sound engineering programs, at least that's what I assume those to be, but I'm not sure they'd be designed out of the box for the radio/microwave bandwidth, nor those bandwidths in this manner (receiving/transmitting).  Human auditory range 0.00002 - 0.02 MHz, lowest cell frequency ~ 700 MHz.  While I think jamming is a DOS attack, I'm kinda thinking there's more to it than just emitting noise on the same frequency... cause if that were the case, nobody in a populated area would be able to make a call.  I think these things are more like repeaters; Inverse repeaters that take the signal, then output the opposite which cancels both signals out.  Like I said though, I know squat about this stuff, I could have this totally wrong... I only wish I was a amateur radio guy/expert.    Cool stuff to think about though.

I've ordered illegal electronics from China in the past, and they have always arrived with no markings on the hardware that identify what they do. The customs forms always said something like, ""Misc. electronics."" I would bet those places still operate the same way. Worst case scenario my package is seized by customs, right? I'm pretty sure DHS is a bit too busy to raid my house over a small, unmarked gadget. And my house is clean, so even if they do, big deal.  I'm a pretty handy DIYer, so I'm going to look over those build it yourself plans as well. If they fall into my skill set I might give that a shot for kicks.  I agree about ordering hardware online, but I'm not against making a day trip to the city to buy parts in person. Hmm, I wonder there is a market for ""certified not purchased over the internet"" drives and such on SR??  (oops, just saw Mirage posted the same idea....sorry, I'm out!!)

And while a psychopath IS a more severely disordered version of APD, there is a separate checklist for determining Psychopathy, and it's extremely difficult to determine whether someone is a Psychopath vs. a Sociopath. So even if you did the checklist, you may still not know if they're a sociopath or a psychopath.

Check fender wells, skirt areas (areas right under you doors) under the car, up inside the rear bumper.;well for starters just remove your gas cap, then check for RF signals again. then you can rule out the gas cap. if not that, then try to physically inspect the immediate entrance to your filler pipe. or you can have a mechanic to do an inspection/smoke test on your filler pipe. they might just find something? i'm not a certified mechanic, but i do 'most' of my own work. and i can think of no reason why any RF signals would be radiating from that area. so try checking yourself first. because without easy access to your engine compartment, one of the most likely places an adversary would hide such a device (assuming it's water/gas proof), out of view, is inside your gas filler pipe. that's what i would do at least? again. just a thought...peacemirage"

I don't think he's that sophisticated, though, he can barely operate a computer, so I'm really thinking it's going to be something easy to get his hands on like the RS gadget.   I guess nothing is ever 100%, but I run a few businesses and my phone is nearly always within reach. I also use a lock code, use a good firewall and limit app access to the network at the root level. There is a chance he would a try a remote install, but I change my passwords frequently and use complex phrases. and like I said, he can barely operate a computer. I did reformat my new phone today, though, just to be safe. I noticed a huge battery drain I couldn't explain that started a few days ago.   Just to be clear, all of my businesses involve a lot of driving, and my phone is my main work tool. It stays home when the felonies are going on     I have been paying attention to that, taking random routes and making random stops. I very hip to  being followed. Psycho doesn't have a vehicle, but he has access to a few. His little minions don't have vehicles, either. They're a pretty sorry lot, they seem to spend all their time doing his bidding and getting high. I'm pretty sure he's promising them all kinds of big $$ once he ""takes me down.""  I also have friends with serious connections who have put out the word on him, but I don't know anything about that...  ","and if it does come down to this, (hopefully not), using a voltmeter to check various points from the battery to the solenoid, ect, on out along the line would help isolate where the power is coming from, and with it the location of the tracking device. just as you would diagnose any electrical problem on a car. it beats blindly replacing cables, starters, ect, as i learned the hard way a long time ago.  but a voltmeter would also be very useful in diagnosing a situation like this.;and you are 100% certain NO ONE possibly involved in any of this (cuz it sounds like there's quite a few) had access to your phone at any point? cuz a cellphone is just a tracking device that can make phone calls. and easily rooted/exploited, especially if they had physical access. you seem to have that covered, but you really should be leaving your cell phone behind anyways when out commiting your felonies and accessing such sensitive areas as you mention. to avoid other known psycho's as well, aka, LE... ;and don't forget there's always the possibily you are being physically followed/tracked if they are really that serious. making lots of u-turn's, watching your rear-view, ect while out commiting your felonies is always good practice...

I'm no expert, but from what I've read/remember:  Depends on how that device is getting its GPS... is it real GPS, or really some cell tower strength ""GPS"".   If you're talking about real GPS, the phone must receive signal from 3(?) GPS satellites... which a jammer would block that reception.   Then for the remote tracking situation/stalking, this data would have wired out through your data connection/cell signal to that stalking person.  I think the GPS jammer should only jam that frequency range... if you want to jam cell signal as well, you'd have to buy a separate jammer (and pay attention to which freq you need).  They do sell multiple bandwidth jammers all in one... yet I do think they are illegal in some jurisdictions.   No doubt LE could position you without GPS.  I'll look into this some more. ","Yoda?would such a device jam GPS on a cell phone/computer as well? or is that hardwired into the cell signal?"

The RF detector beeps randomly (like every 30 seconds or so) in the following areas: muffler/gas fill, and front right fender/headlight. I timed it with a stop watch, it beeps spprox once every 30 seconds then stops for 2 minutes or so, then starts again.  I took a ten minute drive and tried again immdediately, got the same result. I'm going to drive to the location today sans phone and see if I get a call, then I will do it again tomorrow with the phone and see what happens.  I climbed underneath and checked all around the skirt, wheel wells, anything I could shine a flashlight on, then I went through the hood and trunk and did the same thing. Also shined a light down the gas fill pipe.  The way the rf detector I have works is that it beeps faster and faster the closer to the source of the signal it gets, so if I stand 5 feet from my wifi router and slowly walk towards it, it will gradually beep faster and faster. The fact that I'm getting slow, random beeps seem to indicate there is something there, but fuck if I can see it.  Again, thanks for all the help, I am following up on eveyrysuggestion. Oh, and regarding the mma (lol) ya, I have a friend who knows people, I gave him the info but I told him  I don't want to know anything about it. However, this guy is such a freak that may or may not stop him. In fact, that could be why he's (possibley) using gps and not sitting in the bushes watching my house anymore.

The problem with asking that question (search ""laundering"" on the old forums) is that you won't get an answer, however you will get a guaranteed shit-show of a thread filled with insults, non-reason, speculation asserted as fact, drama, excessive use of the word ""trusted"", people wanting your money without telling you what they'll do for you, people who talk but clearly don't know and people who claim to know but don't talk. One thing is guaranteed though, you won't get an answer that will provoke you to respond ""oh wow, the NSA certainly couldn't trace me doing that."" On the bright side, it is the one topic that will give you the most accurate idea of anyone's IQ on the forum.

If one anarchist has his way, itâll soon be used to buy murder, too.Last month I received an encrypted email from someone calling himself by the pseudonym Kuwabatake Sanjuro, who pointed me towards his recent creation: The website Assassination Market, a crowdfunding service that lets anyone anonymously contribute bitcoins towards a bounty on the head of any government officialâa kind of Kickstarter for political assassinations. According to Assassination Marketâs rules, if someone on its hit list is killedâand yes, Sanjuro hopes that many targets will beâany hitman who can prove he or she was responsible receives the collected funds.For now, the siteâs rewards are small but not insignificant. In the four months that Assassination Market has been online, six targets have been submitted by users, and bounties have been collected ranging from ten bitcoins for the murder of NSA director Keith Alexander and 40 bitcoins for the assassination of President Barack Obama to 124.14 bitcoinsâthe largest current bounty on the siteâtargeting Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve and public enemy number one for many of Bitcoinâs anti-banking-system users. At Bitcoinâs current rapidly rising exchanges rate, thatâs nearly $75,000 for Bernankeâs would-be killer.Sanjuroâs grisly ambitions go beyond raising the funds to bankroll a few political killings. He believes that if Assassination Market can persist and gain enough users, it will eventually enable the assassinations of enough politicians that no one would dare to hold office. He says he intends Assassination Market to destroy âall governments, everywhere.ââI believe it will change the world for the better,â writes Sanjuro, who shares his handle with the nameless samurai protagonist in the Akira Kurosawa film âYojimbo.â (He tells me he chose it in homage to creator of the online black market Silk Road, who called himself the Dread Pirate Roberts, as well Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.)  âThanks to this system, a world without wars, dragnet panopticon-style surveillance, nuclear weapons, armies, repression, money manipulation, and limits to trade is firmly within our grasp for but a few bitcoins per person. I also believe that as soon as a few politicians gets offed and they realize theyâve lost the war on privacy, the killings can stop and we can transition to a phase of peace, privacy and laissez-faire.âI contacted the Secret Service and the FBI to ask if theyâre investigating Assassination Market, and both declined to comment.Like other so-called âdark webâ sites, Assassination Market runs on the anonymity network Tor, which is designed to prevent anyone from identifying the siteâs users or Sanjuro himself. Sanjuroâs decision to accept only Bitcoins is also intended to protect users, Sanjuro, and any potential assassins from being identified through their financial transactions. Bitcoins, after all, can be sent and received without necessarily tying them to any real-world identity. In the siteâs instructions to users, Sanjuro suggests they run their funds through a âlaundryâ service to make sure the coins are anonymized before contributing them to anyoneâs murder fund.As for technically proving that an assassin is responsible for a targetâs death, Assassination Market asks its killers to create a text file with the date of the death ahead of time, and to use a cryptographic function known as a hash to convert it to a unique string of characters. Before the murder, the killer then embeds that data in a donation of one bitcoin or more to the victimâs bounty. When a target is successfully murdered, he or she can send Sanjuro the text file, which Sanjuro hashes to check that the results match the data sent before the targetâs death. If the text file is legitimate and successfully predicted the date of the killing, the sender must have been responsible for the murder, according to Sanjuroâs logic. Sanjuro says heâll keep one percent of the payout himself as a commission for his services.Just reading about that coldly calculative system of lethal violence likely inspires queasy feelings or outrage. But Sanjuro says that the publicâs abhorrence wonât prevent the system from working. And as a matter of ethics, he notes that heâll accept only user-suggested targets âwho have initiated force against other humans. More specifically, only people who are outside the reach of the law because it has been subverted and corrupted, and whose victims have no other way to take revenge than to do so anonymously.âEven setting aside the immorality of killing, doesnât the notion of enabling small minorities of angry Bitcoin donors to assassinate elected officials sound like an attempt to cripple democracy? âOf course, limiting democracy is why we even have a constitution,â Sanjuro responds. âMajority support does not make a leader legitimate any more than it made slavery legitimate. With this market the great equalising forces of capitalism have the opportunity to work in politics too. One bitcoin paid is one vote closer to a veto of whatever legislation you dislike.âSanjuro didnât actually invent the concept of an anonymous crowdfunded assassination market. The idea dates back to the cypherpunk movement of the mid-1990s, whose adherents dreamt of using encryption tools to weaken the government and empower individuals. Former Intel engineer and Cypherpunk Mailing List founder Tim May argued that uncrackable secret messages and untraceable digital currency would lead to assassination markets in his âCryptoanarchistâs Manifestoâ written in 1992.A few years later, another former Intel engineer named Jim Bell proposed a system of funding assassinations through encrypted, anonymous donations in an essay he called â Assassination Politics.â The system he described closely matches Sanjuroâs scheme, though anonymity tools like Tor and Bitcoin were mostly theoretical at the time. As Bell wrote then:    If only 0.1% of the population, or one person in a thousand, was willing to pay $1 to see some government slimeball dead, that would be, in effect, a $250,000 bounty on his head. Further, imagine that anyone considering collecting that bounty could do so with the mathematical certainty that he could not be identified, and could collect the reward without meeting, or even talking to, anybody who could later identify him. Perfect anonymity, perfect secrecy, and perfect security. And that, combined with the ease and security with which these contributions could be collected, would make being an abusive government employee an extremely risky proposition. Chances are good that nobody above the level of county commissioner would even risk staying in office.Bell would later serve years in prison for tax evasion and stalking a federal agent, and was only released in March of 2012. When I contacted him by email, he denied any involvement in Sanjuroâs Assassination Market and declined to comment on it.Sanjuro tells me heâs long been aware of Bellâs idea. But he only decided to enact it after the past summerâs revelations of mass surveillance by the NSA exposed in a series of leaks by agency contractor Edward Snowden. âBeing forced to alter my every happy memory during internet activity, every intimate moment over the phone with my loved ones, to also include some of the people I hate the most listening in, analysing the conversation, was the inspiration I needed to embark on this task,â he writes. âAfter about a week of muttering âthey must all dieâ under my breath every time I opened a newspaper or turned on the television, I decided something had to be done. This is my contribution to the cause.âAssassination Market isnât the first website to suggest funding murder with bitcoins. Others Tor-hidden websites with names like Quick Kill, Contract Killer and Câthulhu have all claimed to offer murders in exchange for bitcoin payments. But none of them responded to my attempts to contact their administrators, and all required advanced payments for their services, so they may be scams.And how do Assassination Marketâs users know that itâs not a similar fraud scheme designed to steal usersâ bitcoins? âYou donât,â Sanjuro admits. But he argues that if it were a scam, it would be a very complex and risky one, given that even threatening to harm the president of the United States is a felony.Screen Shot 2013-11-17 at 5.48.50 PMKuwabatake Sanjuro, the ronin samurai in the film âYojimboâ  whose pseudonym the Assassination Marketâs founder has adopted.Other than that, âI can but appeal personally,â Sanjuro writes. âI live a comfortable, albeit somewhat spartan life, and the only thing that really pains me is the increasing attacks on the liberties I enjoy in my daily life, mainly my personal privacy. I cannot buy that with money, so I have no need of it. There is nothing I want more than to see this project succeed, and for that I need dead politicians.âIf the system does prove to work, the launch of Assassination Market may be ill-timed for Sanjuro, given law enforcementâs recent crackdown on the dark web. In August, the FBI used an exploit in Tor to take down the web hosting firm Freedom Hosting and arrest its founder Eric Eoin Marques, who is accused of offering his services to child pornography sites. And just last month, the FBI also seized the popular Bitcoin- and Tor-based black market for drugs known as Silk Road and arrested its alleged creator, Ross Ulbricht.Sanjuro counters that in addition to Tor, Bitcoin, and the usual encryption tools, he has âmeasures in place to prevent the effectiveness of such an arrest. Naturally these will have to be kept secret.âHe adds that, like an earlier generation of cypherpunks, he puts his faith in the mathematical promise of cryptography to trump the governmentâs power to stop him. âWith cryptography, the state, or any protection firm, is largely obsoleteâ¦all activity that can be reduced to information transfer will be completely out of the governmentâs, or anyoneâs, hands, other than the parties involved,â he says.âI am a crypto-anarchist,â Sanjuro concludes. âWe have a bright future ahead of us.ââ"

The idea being, of course, that the assassin will place a bet, then carry out the murder.The idea of betting on the date of death came from the same person who created the Assassination Politics idea: Jim Bell.  This was the very beginning of the cypherpunk era, in '92, when the implications of public-private key cryptography were first becoming apparent.  That was 20 years ago and the tools which were conceptually extrapolated from the crypto mathematics are finally here.  The Forbes article bears the fruit of Jim's essay.  Although Jim's original idea was to predict the date under a public-key encrypted message, any other form of data could be encrypted as well, such as the method, location, or even a video file.  The main point being that whoever can cryptographically tie proof of responsibility to a payment address gets the pot released to that address.You can read the original essay at http://www.outpost-of-freedom.com/jimbellap.htm .  Here is the relevant part (written as a fictional newspaper interview in this chapter):  ...Briefly, digital cash is a system for transferring funds from one person to another on the Net.  For this system to be as good as cash, the transactions must be capable of being conducted anonymously, just like in real life.  (You go into the Seven-Eleven, buy a Cafe Latte, and nobody knows your name or your credit history.  The purchase is not recorded in a database of your consumer preferences.)Several competing schemes for digital cash have been launched, but the one that eventually gains universal acceptance will surely have this anonymity feature.The second innovation is a kind of software called public-key encryption.  It allows you to send a file or an email message that is ""locked"" in such a way that it can only be opened by the intended recipient.  The recipient, however, cannot open it until given a ""key.""  This ""key"" may then be used to encrypt a return message that can only be opened by the original sender.Freelance visionary and tinkerer Jim Bell has been following both of these developments for the past few years.  Recently, he asked himself a couple of tough questions:  ""How can we translate the freedom afforded by the Internet to ordinary life?""  How can we keep government from banning encryption, digital cash, and other systems that will improve our freedom?""Suddenly, Bell had a revolutionary idea.  (""Revolutionary"" is the word he uses, and it fits.)  You and me--the little guys, the ordinary working people of the world--could get together, all pitch in, and pay to have every rotten scoundrel in politics assassinated.  And we could do it legally.  Sort of. Bell imagined an organization that would award ""a cash prize to somebody who correctly 'predicted' the death of one of a list of violators of rights, usually either government employees, officeholders, or appointees.  It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public, and individuals would be able to send those contributions using digital cash.""He explains that ""using modern methods of public-key encryption and anonymous digital cash, it would be possible to make such awards in such a way so that nobody knows who is getting awarded the money, only that the award is being given.  Even the organization itself would have no information that could help the authorities find the person responsible for the prediction, let alone the one who caused the death. ""Are you following this?  Let's say that we, the public, decide we've finally had enough of [insert name of villain].  Ten dollars from me, ten from you--suddenly there's a million dollars in a fund.  The money will go to the first person that can ""predict"" the date, time, and circumstances of the villain's death.  Obviously, this information is only known in advance by the assassin.He sends an anonymous, ""locked"" message.  He kills the villain.  He sends the ""key"" to the message.  He has, without ever revealing his identity,  ""correctly predicted"" the murder.  The ""key"" that he has provided is then used to ""lock the award money in a file that is then publicly posted on the Internet.  Only the person who originated the key may open the file and claim the digital cash."

The original SR has been credited with being the beginning impetus to establishing BTC. SR made it a living trade commodity and grew the BTC economy to the point that it could run on it's own legs. Why couldn't we, as a group, pick another coin that suits us better, adopt it, and build it up like we did BTC? It should be much easier this time because we already have a somewhat robust cryptocurrency market to latch on to and many cryptocurrency exchanges where we could exchange our coin for BTC for cashing out purposes.I believe a concerted effort by the whole SR2 community could potentially be a game changer for ANY small altcoin we chose to adopt.

Zerocoin achieves this by creating a separate anonymous currency that operates side-by-side with traditional Bitcoin on the block chain. Zerocoins can be thought of literally as coins. Theyâre issued in a fixed denomination (for example, 1 BTC), and any user can purchase a zerocoin in exchange for the correct quantity of bitcoin. This purchase is done by placing a special new âZerocoin Mintâ transaction into the block chain.   Once a Mint transaction has been accepted by the Bitcoin peers, the same user can redeem her zerocoin back into bitcoins. She simply embeds a (preferably new) destination Bitcoin address into a âZerocoin Spendâ transaction, then sends it into the network. If the transaction checks out, the Bitcoin peers will treat it just like a normal Bitcoin transfer â meaning that sheâll receive the full bitcoin value of the coin (minus transaction fees) at the destination address.   The key to this process is to ensure that the bitcoins received at the end of this process are completely unlinked to the bitcoins that were used in the beginning. This is accomplished using a variety of cryptographic components, including digital commitments and zero-knowledge proofs. The end result is that it is mathematically infeasible to link the particular bitcoins used at the beginning and end of this process, other than through educated guesswork. ",""

That being said that should not matter overall if we were to go with an alt-coin such as Zerocoin except for the fact it would take a long time to adopt just like Bitcoin so it would be harder to buy unless we all bought Bitcoin and then used exchanges to use Bitcoins to buy Zerocoin and even then we need an exchange like BTC-E to take it on like it has Feathercoin and Namecoin so we can even make that exchange.

Also there are different levels of class 1 - for example it might show   ""NOTE: Photoshop IRB detected""You're right though that some images that are unedited will show up as class 1 edited - for example if your scanning program is also editing software, it will assume that it's edited. Generally the software that comes with HP and Canon scanners edit the image - remember how years ago you used to get an a4 size blank bit you'd need to crop and now they automatically crop it? that's editing, so they will show up as edited. Paypal etc know how to tell the difference between that and a photoshop job. Rather than complicate things I used the most simple and user friendly example - jpegsnoop - to demonstrate this to people.As for classing paypal as tough to pass, I don't - since I use physical IDs - you SHOULD class it as hard to pass, since your scans fail it big time. Out of politeness I didn't mention you by name but I started this thread after a conversation with one of your customers who was asking if I could provide anything that could pass paypal, since yours had spectacularly failed. Yours actually show up as edited by photoshop, which is about as damning as it gets. I was shocked that people were paying $150 or whatever it is for a 5 min photoshop job that shows up as edited by photoshop.There is a 2 minute fix to defeat the problem of jpegsnoop and ELA, a forger would know it.If they can't pass paypal, I wouldn't want to be trusting my money to an exchange account opened with one. You think that as the regulatory environment around bitcoins gets tougher they won't crack down on this? Yeah your business relies on the hope they won't so of course you say they won't. It really isn't difficult to run this retroactively on massive amounts of documents and they WILL do it as bitcoin becomes more mainstream. Eventually the exchanges will be as tough as banks, because effectively they will be banks. Their KYC regulations will ensure they have to make sure all their customers are who they say they are.I'm not doing this for my own purposes anyway, I am not vending here and no longer plan to.

However, here is the bit;  so will scans, copies even photographs of originals documents.  And so will the fake ID you just bought from Winston after reading this FUD, and scanned into your machine.  To explain;  Everyone here knows my game, and I damn passionate about it, work fucking hard at it, and to date, the best at it.   My documents run a 99/100 success rate and when reading this..I thought OH SHIT....  It is my fucking job to get pass crap like this, I had better test it out.....so I did.

Then I took Winston's advice. Got a real ID, scanned it, put the image through the software.....it failed...  In fact after running around 100 separate tests I am still trying to get any damn image edited or not edited to pass.  So.....what can we conclude from this ?  Lets break it down. ......................................................................................

""Do let me know who sells scans for $15, as I need a good laugh at seeing them.""  At the moment most exchanges aren't hot on verifying that your docs are real, but if they decide to get more hot on it in future (which they most certainly will) there is nothign to stop them applying digital forensics checks retroactively and freezing/flagging any accounts that used fake scans.  ""Some truth in this statement.

""This is the good bit. Shall I translate ?  Now I have created a problem, let me solve it. Documents scans don't work but if you buy a real ID from me, (Yes Winston Wolfe is wanting to vend real ID's) then I can solve the problem.""

""Brilliant close, lets get everyone panicking and checking their purchases against an entirely useless piece of software then buy their ID's from Winston.""   Now, it is possible that Winston is entirely innocent here and just a little misguided.  However, the fact he wishes to vend physical ID's and is launching this ""Warning"" and offering the solution....Does lead me to the following conclusion  This a clever bit of Marketing Sales FUD.  As it stands, None of the key places most of our community like to use, are using any kind of ""Forensic"" testing. Most are ""eyes on"", and for those using companies like Verio etc who use a mix of eye/software, all have been passed and tested.  If you want physical ID's for purpose please do get them. All physical ID guys know me, and I support them all in their endevour and will always put those asking me for them their way.  However, do not come in here, attempting to cause deliberate panic to undermine my hard work in the hope of boosting your own. And not when it is such utter FUD.  I always wish to hear about new verification systems and always request any to say, I do my best to stay on top but you need to spot these too. I might be entirely wrong about Winstons intentions here, in which case, I would offer my apologies and mean no offense.  I just stand for the truth and what is best for this community and spreading panic based on utter rubbish and specious logic pisses me off.   There are people out there with $100,000's in exchanges on ""magic"" documents and you are willing to spook all of these people with NO evidence or proof just in the hope of subtly knocking the current best option and push your own.  That fucks me off !! And not the best way to earn your way in here. ","If any of you purchase DIGITAL fake ID scans from any vendors here or elsewhere, please download JpegSnoop - it's a digital forensics software which will tell you whether or not an image has been editedNow when I read this; I thought....ooooh, this sounds serious.

First, lets here some more from our resident Expert Winston Wolfe....The ASSESSMENT is the important partThe above is from a passport scan I bought for $15, and passed Bitstamp verification with...it's an obvious photoshop for anyone checking.At the moment most exchanges aren't hot on verifying that your docs are real, but if they decide to get more hot on it in future (which they most certainly will) there is nothign to stop them applying digital forensics checks retroactively and freezing/flagging any accounts that used fake scans.I've verified MtGox and BitStamp with $15 fake scans, they don't check shit, I could probably draw one with a crayon for bitcoin exchanges at the moment and still pass.The best way to defeat this is to purchase an actual PHYSICAL fake ID from a vendor, and request that they simply scan it then destroy it for you.This works with Paypal and Neteller, who are by far the strictest when it comes to checking verification documents. If any of you have purchased fake ID scans, I'd recommend trying them out with JpegSnoop to make sure you're safe.Winston"

Also there are different levels of class 1 - for example it might show   ""NOTE: Photoshop IRB detected""  You're right though that some images that are unedited will show up as class 1 edited - for example if your scanning program is also editing software, it will assume that it's edited. Generally the software that comes with HP and Canon scanners edit the image - remember how years ago you used to get an a4 size blank bit you'd need to crop and now they automatically crop it? that's editing, so they will show up as edited. Paypal etc know how to tell the difference between that and a photoshop job.   Rather than complicate things I used the most simple and user friendly example - jpegsnoop - to demonstrate this to people.  As for classing paypal as tough to pass, I don't - since I use physical IDs - you SHOULD class it as hard to pass, since your scans fail it big time. Out of politeness I didn't mention you by name but I started this thread after a conversation with one of your customers who was asking if I could provide anything that could pass paypal, since yours had spectacularly failed. Yours actually show up as edited by photoshop, which is about as damning as it gets. I was shocked that people were paying $150 or whatever it is for a 5 min photoshop job that shows up as edited by photoshop.  There is a 2 minute fix to defeat the problem of jpegsnoop and ELA, a forger would know it.  If they can't pass paypal, I wouldn't want to be trusting my money to an exchange account opened with one. You think that as the regulatory environment around bitcoins gets tougher they won't crack down on this? Yeah your business relies on the hope they won't so of course you say they won't. It really isn't difficult to run this retroactively on massive amounts of documents and they WILL do it as bitcoin becomes more mainstream. Eventually the exchanges will be as tough as banks, because effectively they will be banks. Their KYC regulations will ensure they have to make sure all their customers are who they say they are.

Most VPN providers have several servers so if you want to have an american IP you can just pick a server in the US.  I have only used AirVPN in the past, they are based in Italy but I can honestly recomend them. They accept bitcoins, dont keep logs and have their own easy to use software for windows users. Their servers use SSL to prevent traffic sniffing, they also provide free SSH and SSL tunneling so your ISP doest even know you are connecting to a VPN. Make sure you check out their forum if you pick them though so you can set it up properly and prevent dns leaks etc.  I believe there is also a software that can can route your connection through VPN first then Tor and then a socks proxy for example if you want maximum anonymity. Just make sure that whatever IP is last in the chain (so it appears to be you IP) is not blacklisted or flaged and is from the right area.

There was no update for 2 years. The build process requires a 20 year old MS compiler, manually extracted from an exe installer.Imagine yourself as the lead/solo developer working on TC. No one pays you for this, governments hate you, much of the crypto community is throwing rocks at you while your user community spends half of its time joining in with clueless paranoia and the other half whining about feature gaps (e.g. GPT boot disks.) You have to eat, so you have a real paying job. Youâre not so young any more (doing the TC crap for a decade) and maybe the real job now includes responsibilities that crowd out side work. Or maybe youâve got a family you love more than the whiny paranoids you encounter via TC. And now iSec is telling you your code is sloppy and unreadable, and that you should take on a buttload of mind-numbing work to pretty it up so they will have an easier time figuring out where some scotch-fueled coding session in 2005 ( or maybe something you inherited from a past developer) resulted in a gaping exploitable hole that everyone will end up calling a NSA backdoor.Maybe you just toss it in. Why not? Anyone with a maintained OS has an integrated alternative and as imperfect as they may be, they are better than TC for most users. Maintaining TC isnât really doing much good for many people and the audit just pushed a giant steaming pile of the least interesting sort of maintenance into top priority.

I was only talking about the use of Tails in referrence to it being an ideal solution for accessing Darknet Markets and / or Forums such as this. I certainly wasn't advocating the use of Tails to encrypt all your personal, confidential real life information such as family photos / music / movies / TV shows / etc. Generally speaking, most people don't encrypt their HDD's to protect some family photos or their movie collection because if your PC was stolen, the thieves would just dispose of any encrypted HDD's they couldn't access rather than returning them to the original owner. Most people who use Truecrypt to encrypt their entire HDD/s are doing so to hide any evidence of their criminal activities (buying or selling drugs on darknet markets to the sick pedo's who want to hide the videos or images they have stored on their PC away from prying eyes.     I disagree. As a ""normal user"", which I believe I am, I can run Tails on a USB from my laptop and keep any incriminating / personal info. I want kept private and secure in a password protected Persistent Volume.  Most people I know would use their PC for all their current day to day activities and when the time comes that they want to access the Hidden Web via Tor and browse the darknet markets and related forums, they would plug in an encrypted USB drive and reboot into a Live OS and then into Tor. They would then finish up by shutting everything down and rebooting the host PC into it's original OS. The advantage Tails has is it wipes the systems RAM and leave no trace of it's usage.  Of course basic password protection on most PC's / Laptops today is worthless, easily by-passed by anyone with basic computer knowledge or the ability to research the net for possible answers. The overwhelming majority of commercially available software these days is available across all platforms, Windows, Mac and Linux versions. There aren't many Windows only software programs that come to mind but you may know of more.    ","Quote from: The Jigsaw Puzzle on May 29, 2014, 05:02:08 amWhy don't you guys ditch Truecrypt and look at other alternatives.

If it removes the taint, which you can test, then all you have to do is say you sent it from any given wallet which at one point in time in the past had the same amount of bitcoin as you claim to now have in your new untainted wallet. This would work since there is no name associated with any account and no connection between the new and old accounts. This would work best if you were finished vending and wanted to cash out for good for some seed money to start a legitimate business. If you continued to vend then it would be a bad idea because they could start an investigation into you because it is kinda fishy, but they wouldn't be able to prove anything. It's the nature of bitcoin. Then all you would have to pay is capital gains, assuming you are from the US."

You make 50k/year you said you deposit 2k/mon so 24k yearly. That would be means of suspision depending on your lifestyle [mortgage, car payments, etc] {BUT even this isn't enough to hunt for on just paper, you'd have to be under someones radar first so don't make enemies} When OP says Launder, He means turning your dirty no good money, into taxable funds. The way I did this when I was out of highschool was link up with a client who had a legitimate upholstery business. I gave him 2,2k and He'd give me 2k checks as if I was an employee and he'd claim the cash as if it was a job he'd just did. Yeah I was losing 200 biweekly, but this gives you a legitimate income.  Americans have the right to start their own business, and a lot of people don't know that. It's literally a right you are given, they can't tell you no. I say if you have excess funds, start a small shirt printing business or anything in sales and just buy your own products. Nothing like being able to deposit 10k into your account and it be legitimized.","This may be a rookie question, but at what point does money laundering become a necessity (if not always)? For instance, if SWIM deposited no more than $2k into SWIM's bank savings account every once in a while (like once a month or so), would that raise suspicion?

"Silk Road 2 Forums","goblin","5214","2014-02-26T01:32:00","Money Laundering and You - an introduction","Discussion/Legal","Thanks, Meyer! My best to Al and the gang.","What is money laundering?==========================Simply speaking, money laundering is the process by which 'dirty' money is turned into 'clean' money. In simpler terms it is turning money which might be risky to spend into money that you can spend with little to no legal risk.NB: Simply tumbling your BTC does not constitute laundering as it does not provide you with a reasonable explanation regarding the origins of the funds.When looking at complex systems it is useful to break them down into their component parts. In the case of money laundering we can break it down into three steps;* Placement - Where the funds are transformed into something we can easily manipulate.* Layering - Where the funds are manipulated in such a way that it is difficult, or impossible, to determine their origins.* Integration - Where the funds are integrated back into a income stream looking like legitimate income.Let's look at each of these steps more in depth.Placement===========Whether we are starting with cold hard cash or some other kind of funds, we need to transform this into something which we can manipulate in the way of our choosing. Traditionally this meant getting cash into the banking system. In modern times this can mean transforming the funds into digital currencies such as Bitcoin or a derivative thereof.Layering===========Once money is in a form that we can manipulate we will then have to manipulate them in a way such that their origins are obscured. This traditionally meant international bank transfers through countries with strong bank secrecy laws. With digital currencies this step does not need to involve banks and can be done quicker.Integration============Now that the origins of the funds have been obscured they need to be integrated back into your life in a way that masks them as legitimate income. Traditionally this meant owning a cash intensive business, and slowly infiltrating the money into the legitimate cash stream by making fake sales. It should be noted that this particular method includes all three steps in one (It does however rely upon you owning and operating a profitable, or close-to, cash heavy business).Why do we want to launder the money we have?=============================================Funds gained through illicit means can not easily be used to purchase the more substantial assets one might need in life (e.g. real estate, cars, investments, etc.), this is where money laundering comes in. The end-result of properly laundered money is a legal income stream that you can declare to the government and pay taxes on. The latter part being the most important one. Remember; they got Al Capone on Tax Evasion.The reason for making it an income stream is a matter of camouflage. You want to blend in to the masses, and not raise any suspicion. Think of how most people acquire and use money these days: They are paid a salary for a job and pay for any expenses with a credit-/debit card and/or with a national bank account. Anonymous debit cards from offshore banks are only good for paying for operational expenses related to your illicit activity, they should not be your only source of funds as it does not offer an explanation regarding the source of the aforementioned funds.Always remember that money laundering is all about camouflaging yourself financially to avoid suspicion and to 'throw of the scent'. It should be part of a larger OPSEC regiment, but that topic is beyond the scope of this introduction.Any questions?Regards,M. Lansky"

I guess the IRS will probably be knocking soon because I've been doing it for 30 years. It seems every body has an idea about it and there deep respect for the abilities of the government makes them think this is some very complicated thing to do. I always thought it was the easiest thing in the world to do. So let me lay out a simple scenario and we will see what the experts who live in there mama's basement think lol. 72% of millionaires made there money in real estate or so they would have you believe. So your looking for a rental house to buy. Tons of old folks out there with property DON'T WANT TO PAY CAPITAL GAINS TAX! They have the opposite problem as you do.So maybe you can help each other? Smooszhing it could be argued is an art form lol.In other words be his buddy! Your ability to launder money is directly related to your ability to make friends and inspire trust. Ask about his family and job and act all interested lol. Old guys just love to tell you all about there life and the more you ask questions and act interested the better. Smile, Shake hands, pat him on the shoulder, ect. Remember at some point it will come down to ""hey bud you wouldn't be interested in a little cash under the table would you"". It's that fucking simple! So lets lay out a hypothetical example.An older gentleman has a run down house he is selling for $100,000 for sale by owner. You and him come to an agreement to sell it to you (on paper) for $70,000 with 0 down. You then hand him $30,000 and make him very happy. Then you take say $20,000 and fix the place up. Then if your smart you rent it out to an older couple on a fixed income and go on to the next one. As far as the government is concerned you are just a great real estate investor. You can always have the place appraised and take out a loan on the substantial equity you have. On the loan application under employment put property management/real estate investor lol.This is neither scalable nor is the money laundered. The initial cash layout is not accounted for in a way that don't raise eyebrows. You are simply hoping this isn't looked into in any depth or you get audited. By using this method you are gambling with your own and that old man's freedom. That is not a risk that is acceptable to me at least.Regards,M. LanskyHoly shit Have you ever heard of duplexes, four plexes, apartment complexes, commercial property ect. ""nor is the money laundered"" are you fucking kidding me?

If it removes the taint, which you can test, then all you have to do is say you sent it from any given wallet which at one point in time in the past had the same amount of bitcoin as you claim to now have in your new untainted wallet. This would work since there is no name associated with any account and no connection between the new and old accounts. This would work best if you were finished vending and wanted to cash out for good for some seed money to start a legitimate business. If you continued to vend then it would be a bad idea because they could start an investigation into you because it is kinda fishy, but they wouldn't be able to prove anything. It's the nature of bitcoin. Then all you would have to pay is capital gains, assuming you are from the US.","Quote from: snigger on January 11, 2014, 06:19:39 pmI'd just claim that I was an early investor and cash them out slowly over time and pay the capital gains. However this can bring unwanted attention if you want to keep making illegal money, but if you are done with the life and want some taxed seed money to start a legit business this way is perfect.Then if one day you are asked for proof? What do you do? Because it is a legal requirment to keep a list of transactions for at least 5 years, often 10 years as well might I add.You can play dumb like 'dooooh I didn't know..' but then they'll find some sort of fine to hit you with. Laundering BTC straight up is hard, Energo offered me the option with his service but we decided to go down another route. However, I think he is successfully pulling it off with several of his clients. To be honest Snigger, your method would probably work if you just do small amounts at a time spread randomly over a longer period of time. However I've been taught with laundering that you should act as though the IRS/HMRC are 100% going to look in to you - better safe than sorry to me."

The purpose of this thread is to convince you *why* it is necessary to effectively launder your ill-gotten gains. It is not here to tell you *how* to launder your ill-gotten gains. Why not?   Well, a money launderer who's good at his or her job has spent a vast amount of time learning their trade. The people whose job it is to detect money laundering have massive resources at their disposal, are extremely patient and methodical, know practically all of the money laundering tricks in the book and possess the authority to question you over some relatively minor abberation in your bookkeeping from five years ago - and hang you for it plus the rest of your operation because you cannot prove it was a legal transaction. A good money launderer must be able to outsmart these people.  A good money launderer has a very rare skillset that people are willing to pay large sums of money for. If you commissioned such an expert to work for you, they would have to spent many hours developing a bespoke money laundering strategy for your business, and then issued you with procedures that you must follow to the letter without fail so that your money comes out the other end clean. If you ever had to prove your money clean, your launderer would have ensured your case was strong.   THIS KIND OF EXPERTISE DOES NOT COME CHEAP, let alone free.   Would you ask your accountant to tell you how to minimise your tax burden for free? Would you ask your physiotherapist to attend to your aching joints for the princely sum of zero?  Do you have a stack of dirty money that needs laundering? Sorry, there's no Money Laundering For Dummies publication. Pay a professional to launder your drug money, and expect to pay a lot, because their knowledge is rare and valuable. They aren't going to share it on a thread like this. But if you do pay a quality money launderer to legitimise your income...well with what's left over you get to do with as you please  ","I'm sad to see such little activity in this thread  I'd like to know where I could find more info about laundering. I've been doing some research but it's a difficult topic to find much about"
"Silk Road 2 Forums","Lansky","5214","2013-12-01T11:32:44","Money Laundering and You - an introduction","Discussion/Legal"," What is money laundering? ========================== Simply speaking, money laundering is the process by which 'dirty' money is turned into 'clean' money. In simpler terms it is turning money which might be risky to spend into money that you can spend with little to no legal risk.  NB: Simply tumbling your BTC does not constitute laundering as it does not provide you with a reasonable explanation regarding the origins of the funds.  When looking at complex systems it is useful to break them down into their component parts. In the case of money laundering we can break it down into three steps;  * Placement - Where the funds are transformed into something we can easily manipulate.* Layering - Where the funds are manipulated in such a way that it is difficult, or impossible, to determine their origins.* Integration - Where the funds are integrated back into a income stream looking like legitimate income.Let's look at each of these steps more in depth.   Placement =========== Whether we are starting with cold hard cash or some other kind of funds, we need to transform this into something which we can manipulate in the way of our choosing. Traditionally this meant getting cash into the banking system. In modern times this can mean transforming the funds into digital currencies such as Bitcoin or a derivative thereof.   Layering =========== Once money is in a form that we can manipulate we will then have to manipulate them in a way such that their origins are obscured. This traditionally meant international bank transfers through countries with strong bank secrecy laws. With digital currencies this step does not need to involve banks and can be done quicker.   Integration ============ Now that the origins of the funds have been obscured they need to be integrated back into your life in a way that masks them as legitimate income. Traditionally this meant owning a cash intensive business, and slowly infiltrating the money into the legitimate cash stream by making fake sales. It should be noted that this particular method includes all three steps in one (It does however rely upon you owning and operating a profitable, or close-to, cash heavy business).   Why do we want to launder the money we have? ============================================= Funds gained through illicit means can not easily be used to purchase the more substantial assets one might need in life (e.g. real estate, cars, investments, etc.), this is where money laundering comes in. The end-result of properly laundered money is a legal income stream that you can declare to the government and pay taxes on. The latter part being the most important one. Remember; they got Al Capone on Tax Evasion.  The reason for making it an income stream is a matter of camouflage. You want to blend in to the masses, and not raise any suspicion. Think of how most people acquire and use money these days: They are paid a salary for a job and pay for any expenses with a credit-/debit card and/or with a national bank account.   Anonymous debit cards from offshore banks are only good for paying for operational expenses related to your illicit activity, they should not be your only source of funds as it does not offer an explanation regarding the source of the aforementioned funds.   Always remember that money laundering is all about camouflaging yourself financially to avoid suspicion and to 'throw of the scent'. It should be part of a larger OPSEC regiment, but that topic is beyond the scope of this introduction.  Any questions?  Regards,  M. Lansky",""

It's that fucking simple! So lets lay out a hypothetical example.An older gentleman has a run down house he is selling for $100,000 for sale by owner. You and him come to an agreement to sell it to you (on paper) for $70,000 with 0 down. You then hand him $30,000 and make him very happy. Then you take say $20,000 and fix the place up. Then if your smart you rent it out to an older couple on a fixed income and go on to the next one. As far as the government is concerned you are just a great real estate investor. You can always have the place appraised and take out a loan on the substantial equity you have. On the loan application under employment put property management/real estate investor lol.This is neither scalable nor is the money laundered. The initial cash layout is not accounted for in a way that don't raise eyebrows. You are simply hoping this isn't looked into in any depth or you get audited.

Thats why us professional launderers know what business will and wont work for certain people.   Got to have a tight ship and the kind of businesses where transactions can't permanently be tracked/watched.  Take a high class busy bar for example, bottles of rare alcohol can be bought in for a reasonable price in bulk and then you can sell for triple the price. You'll get some sales from people trying to flash their cash to show off for the females but you get rid of most of the bottles by giving people the cash to come in and buy them.   Have 10 people you trust buy a bottle at $1000 each, you give them the cash obviously and that's 10K in the register. Minus the money you spent on the product, maybe 2.5K. That's 7.5K profit in a night. It might sound far fetched but people in these types of clubs spend that kind of money on champagne and all that sort of stuff.  This is more of an expensive one to set up and for more of the high rollers but it works.     Now, if you become a person of interest and LE come to the bar for a stake out, it's busy as hell in the first place which makes it difficult for them to do survalieance. Drunk people shouting, dancing, screaming as well as loud music and general annoyance, as in bouncers stopping trouble between people and the beauty of it all if you notice LE are watching, you have security that can chuck LE out the club. Make it look like they've did something wrong and the security team can have them out the door in minutes and that's there little survaliance mission over. It gives them a hard time to do their job.  I know I talked about not posting methods, but I don't think anyone here has the time to run their online business as well as a succussful high end night club. Well that is hardly a method, that is just like 1% of an overall laundering scheme but I'm sure you'll understand what I'm getting at.    EDIT: People need to stop using car washes as an example, I've had enough of breaking bad after watching every series twice  ","The way i look at it is that there are TWO scenarios.1) no one is interested in you and your chosen method suffices to not bring attention to you.2) you are a ""person of interest"" or at ANY POINT in the future become a person of interest. Your previously sufficient method now comes under intense surveillance and may become quite easy to gather evidence of laundering.Its perfect till its not, then all the mistakes (that you didn't even know you were making) come outDesign your chosen method by pretending that at this very moment you are being kept tabs on.All of a sudden that car wash with 3 customers per day driving in and 9k per week turn over doesn't seem that perfect any more, does it?Food for thought."

It's that fucking simple! So lets lay out a hypothetical example.  An older gentleman has a run down house he is selling for $100,000 for sale by owner. You and him come to an agreement to sell it to you (on paper) for $70,000 with 0 down. You then hand him $30,000 and make him very happy. Then you take say $20,000 and fix the place up. Then if your smart you rent it out to an older couple on a fixed income and go on to the next one.   As far as the government is concerned you are just a great real estate investor. You can always have the place appraised and take out a loan on the substantial equity you have.

I saw people on here that were confused regarding what laundering was really about and I wanted to clear up some misunderstandings.  Actually laundering with BTC is much easier than with fiat and the 'half of the solution that is missing' that you mention have been solved for quite some time and have been in use for as long.","While this is a nice basic outline you can find anywhere on the internet, the laundering problem with BTC is a different animal than laundering cash because you're starting from the point where you have digital funds, not cash. Basically half the solution remains missing. Without an obviously safe method for converting BTC into a national currency as a first step, you never reach the point where you can do the rest of the usual processes mentioned above which are all well known. The question to answer is to show how to go from BTC to a national currency without a trail, keeping in mind the US monitors global credit card and bank transfers. What we need is intel from someone who's been laundering large amounts of BTC, over long periods of time, who can speak from real up-to-date experience about things you can't learn from FINCEN reports."

Charlie Shrem, along with a co-conspirator, is accused of selling over $1 million in bitcoins to Silk Road users, who would then use them to buy drugs and other illicit items.  According to the criminal complaint, Shrem himself bought drugs on Silk Road.  ""Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way,"" DEA agent James Hunt said in a release.   Shrem is a vice chairman at the Bitcoin Foundation. He is listed as a speaker at a Bitcoin conference in Miami that ended Sunday.  Shrem is believed to own a substantial amount of bitcoins.  BitInstant, which is backed by the Winklevoss twins, is currently offline. It was recently the subject of a class-action suit alleging misrepresentation of its services.  The arrest comes on the eve of a two-day state hearing about the future of Bitcoin in New York.  Here's the full release from the Justice Department. An embed of the full criminal complaint follows.

FAIELLA, a/k/a âBTCKing,â an underground Bitcoin exchanger, and CHARLIE SHREM, the Chief Executive Officer and Compliance Officer of a Bitcoin exchange company, for engaging in a scheme to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to users of âSilk Road,â the underground website that enabled its users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement. Each defendant is charged with conspiring to commit money laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. SHREM is also charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding FAIELLAâs illegal transactions through the Company, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. SCHREM was arrested yesterday at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. FAIELLA was arrested today at his residence in Cape Coral, Florida, and is expected to be presented in federal court in the Middle District of Florida.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: âAs alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly innovative business models donât need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.â  DEA Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge James J. Hunt said: âThe charges announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way. Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.â  IRS Special-Agent-in-Charge Toni Weirauch said: âThe government has been successful in swiftly identifying those responsible for the design and operation of the âSilk Roadâ website, as well as those who helped âSilk Roadâ customers conduct their illegal transactions by facilitating the conversion of their dollars into Bitcoins. This is yet another example of the New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Forceâs proficiency in applying financial investigative resources to the fight against illegal drugs.â  According to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:  From about December 2011 to October 2013, FAIELLA ran an underground Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website, a website that served as a sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar where illegal drugs of virtually every variety were bought and sold regularly by the siteâs users. Operating under the username âBTCKing,â FAIELLA sold Bitcoins â the only form of payment accepted on Silk Road â to users seeking to buy illegal drugs on the site. Upon receiving orders for Bitcoins from Silk Road users, he filled the orders through a company based in New York, New York (the âCompanyâ). The Company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash for Bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. FAIELLA obtained Bitcoins with the Companyâs assistance, and then sold the Bitcoins to Silk Road users at a markup.  SHREM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from about August 2011 until about July 2013, when the Company ceased operating, he was also its Compliance Officer, in charge of ensuring the Companyâs compliance with federal and other anti-money laundering (âAMLâ) laws. SHREM is also the Vice Chairman of a foundation dedicated to promoting the Bitcoin virtual currency system.  SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated FAIELLAâs business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLAâs business as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA to use the Companyâs services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers; personally processed FAIELLAâs orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLAâs illicit activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Companyâs Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the Companyâs AML restrictions, even though it was SHREMâs job to enforce them and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as a money services business.  Working together, SHREM and FAIELLA exchanged over $1 million in cash for Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road.  In late 2012, when the Company stopped accepting cash payments, FAIELLA ceased doing business with the Company and temporarily shut down his illegal Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road. FAIELLA resumed operating on Silk Road in April 2013 without the Companyâs assistance, and continued to exchange tens of thousands of dollars a week in Bitcoins until the Silk Road website was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013.  *                      *                      *  FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. SHREM is also charged with one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the DEAâs New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force, which is comprised of agents and officers of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the New York City Police Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations, the New York State Police, the U. S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Marshal Service, New York National Guard, Office of Foreign Assets Control and the New York Department of Taxation and Finance. Mr. Bharara also thanked the FBIâs New York Field Office.  Mr. Bharara also noted that the investigation remains ongoing.  The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Officeâs Complex Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Serrin Turner is in charge of the prosecution, and Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Adams of the Asset Forfeiture Unit is in charge of the forfeiture aspects of the case.  The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  After reading the complaint, the BitInstant CEO and the BTCKing guy were busted for terrible OPSEC.  The former used his work email account to communicate with and collude with the BTCKing vendor, who was himself busted because he was having his customers deposit money to his personal bank account.

Ordering internationally is more risky sure because it goes through customs on both borders, if you're only doing it once or twice you will probably only get a love letter (in the unlikely event of your package being seized), if you are doing it regularly they may monitor the packages to get a warrant to raid your house - that is, if you continue to order internationally to the same address after already having a package seized. Hope that makes sense, if you are ordering bulk internationally more regularly it may be safer to use alternating dropspots and never use the same address twice.  As above tails only really helps once LE is already aware of you, in that there is nothing connecting you to the darknet on your PC.  To be honest I've ordered lbs of weed to my own address (from Canada to UK, multiple packages over a few months) using TBB in the past and had no issues, it wasn't even packaged in MBB, vaccum packs or anything, just a big ass baggie.

The general gist of tails, if for some reason there is an exploit, house gets raided, computer gets infected etc etc then tails protects you. It's basically a security harden system out of the box.  Day to day buyer is usually safe from these worries, but at the end of the day it is you who will be going to prison if you're not serious about your operational security.  International importation of controlled drugs is a lot more serious than domestic, hence the price fluctuation depending on which country you live in. Like here in Australia, it's normal for drugs to be a minimal of 300% more than say Europe, some drugs get anywhere up to 2500%+ more in cost. Supply vs demand & reward vs risk",""

The benefit of tails as others have described is more of a hardware advantage. i.e. if you use tails, then no information gets stored (purposely or otherwise) to your computer's hardrive. When you simply run tor on your computer without tails, then you run the risk of having sensitive information on your hardrive should your hardrive get confsicated and analyzed. In terms of what you are ordering, having tails doesn't really add any security to that, just so long as you are using tor (which you have to be to access SR anway) and using it properly.","Quote from: Slipperyjimdigriz on June 25, 2014, 06:12:11 pmNo sorry man, I just use a cheap laptop - from what I hear Macs are notorious for being hard to get tails ontoMaybe buy a cheap ass 2nd hand laptop from ebay?

The secret globalist agreement will have a significant effect on a wide range of issues including internet freedom, medicine, patents, and civil liberties. The cabal will meet in Salt Lake, Utah, between November 19 and 24.  The draft text for the TPP Intellectual Property Rights Chapter spells out provisions for implementing a transnational âenforcement regimeâ designed to supplant national laws and sovereignty with a globalist construct. The TPP is by far the largest and most oppressive economic treaty devised thus far. It will have an impact on a staggering 40 percent of worldwide GDP. The TPP is the forerunner to the equally secret US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TPP). Both treaties combined will cover 60 percent of world GDP and exclude China.  Enforcement will be accomplished by âsupranational litigation tribunals to which sovereign national courts are expected to defer.â According to the document, the globalist courts can conduct hearings with secret evidence.  In addition, aspects of the treaty resemble SOPA and ACTA treaties with draconian surveillance mechanisms. In early 2013, thousands of websites âwent blackâ to show solidarity in opposition to SOPA, or the Stop Online Piracy Act, legislation that seriously threatened the functionality of the internet. âSOPA was an attempt to put the power of information back in the hands of an elite few who are rapidly losing the ability to control what the masses are reading, hearing and seeing,â Mac Slavo wrote in January, 2012.  âSince the beginning of the TPP negotiations, the process of drafting and negotiating the treatyâs chapters has been shrouded in an unprecedented level of secrecy,â Wikileaks notes in a statement on the release of the TPP draft. âAccess to drafts of the TPP chapters is shielded from the general public. Members of the US Congress are only able to view selected portions of treaty-related documents in highly restrictive conditions and under strict supervision. It has been previously revealed that only three individuals in each TPP nation have access to the full text of the agreement, while 600 âtrade advisersâ â lobbyists guarding the interests of large US corporations such as Chevron, Halliburton, Monsanto and Walmart â are granted privileged access to crucial sections of the treaty text.â  Obama is poised to fast-track the secret agreement. âThe US administration is aggressively pushing the TPP through the US legislative process on the sly,â said Wikileaks editor Julian Assange.  âIf instituted, the TPPâs IP regime would trample over individual rights and free expression, as well as ride roughshod over the intellectual and creative commons. If you read, write, publish, think, listen, dance, sing or invent; if you farm or consume food; if youâre ill now or might one day be ill, the TPP has you in its crosshairs,â Assange added.",""

"Silk Road 2 Forums","Brahman","17605","2014-01-16T02:15:15","Spain is taking a Prohibitionist view on substance abuse","Discussion/Legal","***Clearnet Warning***  http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/07/inenglish/1389099926_537164.html?rel=rosEP On December 10, the Uruguayan Senate approved a new law regulating the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. In doing so, the South American country has become the first nation to legalize the substance. Over the coming months, much attention will be paid to this novel approach to dealing with drug use, and the first instance in half a century that a country has dared to challenge the orthodoxy laid down by the United States and most European nations in this regard. That said, even in the United States there are changes afoot, albeit at regional level: since January 1, the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes has been legal in the state of Colorado; later this year, similar legislation will come into effect in the state of Washington. New York is also considering the move.  But Spain, which two decades ago had some of the most relaxed drug legislation in the world, is now firmly headed in the opposite direction. As part of a raft of controversial measures under its so-called Citizen Safety Law, the government is now proposing to triple the minimum fine for possession of drugs in public as well as banning the cultivation of marijuana plants for personal use - despite private consumption remaining legal. The possibility of waiving fines in exchange for undergoing treatment is also to be withdrawn.  It is now 43 years since disgraced US President Richard Nixon declared war on drugs, announcing in 1971 that consumption of illegal substances was a ""national emergency"" and the country's ""public enemy number one."" He set aside millions of dollars to increase the number of organizations to combat drug use, which acted not just at home but also throughout the Americas and the rest of the world. More than four decades on, as with Prohibition in the 1920s, the policy has proved a disaster: few people would deny that the war was lost a long time ago, and that despite continued astronomical spending and the use of the armed forces and other resources, addiction levels, trafficking and violence related to drugs continue to rise, or at best have leveled off.  Countless reports and research have confirmed this over the years, the most recent being the UN's Global Commission on Drugs Policy, published in 2011, which marked a turning point in international recognition not only of the failure of the war on drugs, but also of the collateral damage it has caused around the world. With contributions from writers, experts, and politicians such as Javier Solana, Kofi Annan, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes and George Shultz, the report called on governments to try new approaches including the legal regulation of drugs, particularly cannabis, ""to safeguard the health and security of the people.""  Which poses the question as to why Spain has decided to move in the opposite direction of global opinions that now increasingly lean toward dealing with drug use from a damage-limitation perspective, instead opting to increase fines while depriving users of the chance to seek treatment.  ""The government is swimming against the tide. We are returning to concepts from the middle of the last century that are being abandoned in the civilized world,"" says Araceli ManjÃ³n-Cabeza, a former director general of Spain's National Drugs Plan. ""Eliminating the possibility of participating in a detox or rehab program puts us in the same league as countries like Russia, where anybody who consumes drugs is immediately considered a criminal,"" she says.  ManjÃ³n, who also served for two years as an investigating magistrate in the High Court, ""where the biggest drug trafficking trials are held,"" says that her experience there turned her from a supporter of prohibition, to one of the most vocal proponents of a sea change in policy. ""Working from the position of prohibition gave me a privileged outlook. I had absolutely no idea of what was really going on, until finally I realized that we were spending huge sums of money and dedicating vast amounts of time and energy to this issue, and achieving absolutely nothing positive in return."" She says that she is now, ""broadly speaking,"" in favor of legalizing all drugs, ""but this doesn't mean an open house."" EL PAÃS contacted the current head of the National Drugs Plan, but has so far received no reply.  There is a growing chorus of voices around the world calling for a change in drugs policy. In the wake of Uruguay's bold move to legalize marijuana at least eight other countries in Latin America are now either considering decriminalizing the personal consumption of the substance, or contemplating an across-the-board legalization of all drugs. In May, the Organization of American States (OAS) announced that it was considering approving legalization as the best way to halt the violence associated with drug trafficking on the continent, which over the last two decades has left tens of thousands dead in Colombia and Mexico. Even before Colorado's move, in the United States some 17 states had already approved the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, allowing the substance to be bought from registered suppliers with a doctor's prescription.   Meanwhile, in the rest of Europe, other countries are also considering relaxing their approach to drugs. Switzerland has already decriminalized possession for personal use. In November the local council of Kreutzberg, a fashionable central neighborhood in the German capital of Berlin, approved a motion to open Dutch-style coffee shops in the GÃ¶rlitzer park, an area that has long been associated with drug dealing. In December, 106 German law academics, among them the former head of the Federal Court, signed a petition in support of the decriminalization of marijuana and other substances. In March, in Denmark, Copenhagen City Hall announced that it intends to begin a three-year pilot project that would see the municipal authorities take over the production and distribution of cannabis.  In Belgium it is now permitted to carry up to three grams of marijuana, or have a plant at home for personal use. In 2001, Portugal became the first country in Europe to decriminalize the use and possession of all illegal drugs. More than a decade later, drug use has increased slightly, along the lines of growth in other European countries. But importantly, consumption of heroin has decreased â which was the main aim of the Portuguese authorities in introducing the legislation â and with it the number of prosecutions.  ""It has been shown incontrovertibly that sanctions do not reduce drug consumption,"" says Carmen MartÃ­nez, the secretary of UNAD, the Union of Help Associations and Entities for Drug Addicts. ""It is never too late for addicts to turn away from drugs, this is shown on a daily basis, and they should not be pursued unless help is offered. Imposing fines has also been proven to be meaningless, because most of these people are unable to pay them.""  ManjÃ³n says that the government's move is an effort to block initiatives in Catalonia and the Basque Country, where the regional parliaments have set up commissions to look into initially regulating the use of marijuana through private associations of users and growers. ""Banning the cultivation of marijuana plants would be a death blow to these associations,"" says ManjÃ³n.     Jaume Xaus, the National Federation of Cannabis Users spokesman, agrees: ""This is not about pursuing traffickers, but blocking initiatives that civil society has come up with. They are trying to put a spanner in the works."" The Interior Ministry, which has not bothered to consult cannabis associations, NGOs or charities that work with drug addicts, seems set to bring an end to the current legal limbo. Aside from imposing fines of up to 30,000 euros for ""plantations that do not constitute a crime,"" the new law would also allow for measures such as ""the suspension or closure of clubs"" where drugs are being consumed, as well as the ""withdrawal of authorizations, permits and licenses."" Current legislation does not allow for fines to be imposed on people growing a plant at home.  If the police want to bring a prosecution against somebody for growing marijuana, a judge must then decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether a crime has been committed. Meanwhile, the Catalan regional executive says that it intends to press ahead with its efforts to regulate marijuana use, and is currently drafting a ""good practice code"" that would allow the existence of cannabis associations, despite any new prohibition legislation that the central government might introduce. The Interior Ministry meanwhile denies that the proposed ban on growing marijuana is a tool to close down consumer and growers' associations.  Regarding the increase in fines, the interior ministry says: ""1,000 euros in 2014 is not a significantly higher amount to the 300-euro fine of 1992."" Similarly, it argues that the reason for ending the policy of offering drug users the chance to avoid paying a fine by undergoing treatment is that it ""has proved unproductive in terms of the goals of social integration pursued."" This would seem to run counter to the evidence in many countries around the world showing that governments save money and benefit society overall when they invest in health and integration programs for drug addicts rather than spending the money on policing and enforcing the law. Report after report shows that countries that have developed damage reduction strategies (syringe collection, assistance, rehab programs, etc.) have much lower HIV rates.  For example, in Australia, only two percent of registered drug addicts are HIV positive; in Russia, where there is no damage limitation policy and drug users face prison, the figure is 35 percent. Another important factor that has now been established is that the decision to start taking drugs has much more to do with social and economic factors, fashions or peer-group pressure, than with permissive laws.  According to the European Union's 2013 Report on Drugs, at least 85 million adults, a quarter of the bloc's adult population, have taken some kind of illegal drug at least once in their lives. Of these, 77 million say that drug was cannabis. Of the estimated 250 million drug users in the world, the UN says that only 10 percent can reasonably be described as addicts or ""problematic."" In Spain, the most recent report on drug use, from 2011, shows that alcohol, heroin and cannabis use have all stabilized, and that cocaine use has fallen.  ManjÃ³n believes that neither the data nor the current situation justify the government's proposed crackdown. ""This has nothing to do with science, and everything to do with politics,"" she says. ""The global trend is toward legalization, or at the very least toward a more humane and coherent approach to the issue.""",""

I think this had less to do with the decision of the emperor then with the involvement of the British empire to consolidate their monopoly. Not by chance that the Opium Wars are also called the Anglo-Chinese Wars     I think it is a proposal atm, and a lot to do with the emergence of this new phenomenon of the cannabis associations. In all true this is not new - every time the center-right party (PP) comes to power they regulate substance abuse - Spain had no laws regulating it until Aznar came to power in the 90s. I agree that a lot is the central government going heads on against the independence movements of the autonomous regions of Catalunya and Basque country, whom in turn are exploring the cannabis issue for exactly the same reasons.  Unfortunately prohibition is the usual answer many governments have to the drug problem - it is the lack of trust that they have in the individual capacity of each to choose their own path. But the winds of change are coming and I personally believe that we will witness a legalization and regulation movement on a global scale within the next decade or so.","Quote from: ahh bisto on January 16, 2014, 08:52:57 amConsidering Spain's  economical state you would think they would make it legal and allow coffee shops. The take revenue from it??They do currently have legal smoking clubs;In the early 19th century, when opium smoking was gaining popularity in China, the Emperor took counsel from his mandarins. One party argued for taxation and regulation, the other for prohibition. The prohibitionists won, with the result that the profitability on opium sales to China rose over 1000%. The consequence was an unparalleled wave of smuggling, the penetration of opium to every corner of China, a rate of addiction never seen before or after, and ultimately the collapse of the Manchu dynasty into civil war, invasion and famine. Had the Emperor chosen the pragmatic choice of regulation and control, the use of opium in China would never have followed the course it did.;Thanks for that post OP +1 to you.I heard about that change of policy a while ago. Do you know if this is already effective, or if it is a proposal?Also, as all associaciones operate based on the fact  you are allowed to consume drugs privatly. So it won'T affect the principles of those clubs. These guys are winning each and every trial more or less since it all started in the basque country. And you have them at every corner now. As for the criminal enterprises importing hash or coke I don't see where this will affect them at all.It will though strenghten all separatists I believe."

Keep in mind that Tails doesn't support entry guards at the moment so Obfs3 bridges are pretty good in leiu of guards.  Though the way I think of it, bridges can act as a guard, let's say a bridge is compromised, now you only have a single relay, then your exit node.   You are also stealing traffic from people who really need bridges like people in China/Iran/etc.  If you live in a country where using Tor is not incredibly suspicious you are going to want to use entry guards just because there are far more of them than bridges and they often stick around longer leading to a lower surface of attack.

Just as long as they tell the SR community before adopting it so we can get a leg up on the competition who use Bitcoin to exploit others and accumulate wealth.  The fact they are working with the CIA should say enough along with how obviously they have the network mapped after JesusWasaMushroom showed us that link to the Silk Road wallets and any connected to them.   That was jaw dropping stuff.  I am a big fan of anything that maintains anonymity and I also believe we need to make a coin backed by gold and silver somehow that moves with the market value of those metals as opposed to wild speculations and market collusion which is basically insider trading. I am sure it is being manipulated this is outrageous however it will go up to $1000+ each before it collapses back to around $100. That is my guess.  Great post though really good to know there are poeple working on promoting real free trade which Bitcoin is not. It is obvious that using Bitcoin they would have caught Ross/DPR eventually based on that crazy picture.  I had heard other people in my social circle talking about how their computers would have worked it all out and there it is for all to see.  It was a shame the addresses weren't visible though I would have loved to have gone over some out of curiosity.  Thanks for the interesting read I will definitely checkout your Freecoin.

"Silk Road 2 Forums","eThug","2806","2013-11-13T06:06:39","OpenBSD, Torbrowser","Discussion/Security","^This. The Problem with OpenBSD is that it does not offer any signed files  From the Whonix FAQ: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/FAQ","if you dont know how to install openbsd you shouldnt be using openbsd.whonix on a fde host ftw.;OpenBSD fails completely for the Tor threat model which downloading and updating software over untrusted exit relays. OpenBSD does not offer any signed files, they do not even offer hash sums for all required files (at least the ports tar ball doesn't have one). When asking about that the answer is ""buy the CDs"" (=something like $80 per year if you want to stay current). As if CDs via post through a 3rd party reseller offer a better trust chain than mirrors with hash sums, let alone proper WOT signatures. There are alternatives to GnuPG if it's just about the license... Further, tracking stable - which is recommended for production systems - is needlessly complex: it requires the user to recompile everything even though there are usually only a few packages that require an update. The most fitting approach would be to just apply the patches from the errata but apparently not all security related fixes in -stable are listed there and OpenBSD admits as much that patch branch is really not user-friendly. Further problems: OpenBSD seems to default to using very ""conservative"" hash algorithms, md5 or sha1 which are both broken. This clashes with their claimed crypto focus. FDE support is lacking/limited. There doesn't seem to be a modern mandatory access control (MAC[2]), instead there's systrace which has been criticized for having fundamental security problems (this may or may not have changed since then). OpenBSD doesn't seem to be using PIE executables by default, meaning, it doesn't really have ASLR. Documentation about such issues is completely lacking. There's also the strange policy of sticking with bind and sendmail when there were secure-by-design alternatives (see PDF!) with much better track record, BIND-9, despite the rewrite, continues to be a security hazard just judging by the OpenBSD errata entries. OpenBSD would otherwise be a great choice for Whonix-Gateway. It has a very capable firewall, the track record is probably better than of any other OS though they (just like their competition for fairness sakes) prefer to label ""potential"" code execution vulnerabilities as a DoS. OpenBSD is also a very small OS (small TCB), its kernel may be the most secure UNIX-like kernel, but it's still a monolithic kernel. Their claim of being THE most secure operating system has become more and more dubious since the introduction of actually usable microkernels. In summary: I don't like their attitude and several essential (for Whonix) security properties are missing.Also see security vulnerability - NTP not authenticated and it doesn't look like they step forward to fix it. The suggestion was to authenticate the connection to the NTP server, which is not possible for Whonix for many reasons. [3]OpenBSD's target audience aren't end users, that's why they don't care to provide signed updates for the masses, see How to check downloaded package on OpenBSD 5.1?.OpenBSD's website isn't reachable over SSL or as a Tor hidden service. How are users supposed to securely view the OpenBSD site and not learn things set up by a man-in-the-middle?If they don't attract the masses, ordinary crackers, hackers and the security research community doesn't get attracted as they do with more popular operating systems. At the same time a targeted attack gets easier, because people who get paid to find exploits can find them more easily.If this sounds a bit harsh on OpenBSD it's because it could be such a great OS but it isn't (mostly more for political and social/""ego"" than technical reasons) which is frustrating.Update 1: There is now Qubes OS and I am missing such innovative security improvements from OpenBSD, which claims to be the most secure operating system.Update 2: OpenBSD according to bststats.org (w) has very few users. 56 at time of writing. I know, that people must undergo a rather complicated manual process to get counted, however compared to 24,168 FreeBSD users, that's not very much. "

I don't even think it supports having a desktop environment fresh after install, pretty sure it just dumped me into a shell and I had to configure the system from that point. I would look more in Qubes personally. OpenBSD is nice though and it will reduce the likelihood that you are hacked versus using most other operating systems. ",""
