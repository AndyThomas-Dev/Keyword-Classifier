Another possibility is using a google voice number thats forwarded to the number of the iphone. Ultimately, its pretty risky to use this phone to do illegal stuff but if its not too illegal I'd go for it otherwise might want to consider getting a more secure untraceable phone.","fnufnu wrote:benzon: The idea of a signal blocking pouch is nice but thing is, if my boy keep the phone in the pouch all day, how do I contact that phone?

Apple is a pain in the ass, even when one uses it for normal purposes. Using Apple for such stuff is not recommended. You'd rather ask the CIA for help.

So keep it under $1000, unless you know the limit is higher, and try to always choose next day shipping if you can.","freshvybz wrote:so it's best to card like two buy get that delivered. than retry?"

"Evolution Forums","GetBTC","6221","2014-03-31T12:58:04","PP/VCC to BTC method! [HOT] [REVIEWED]","Guides Vendors","EDIT: I want to point out this is NOT a newbie guide. You will already have to be experienced in PP, getting funds into accounts and being able to send on. Also it is not suitable to go direct from hacked accounts to using my method, you will want middlemen accounts.  The reason I don't provide any method to get funds in to PP accounts? There is already loads of great methods for sale on EVO, I suggest you find one of those and but that instead. Or of course you could use a PP funds transfer service, again there are quite a few on here. (but through a middleman account). I will provide any afterservice you need t use my method, but sorry I can't help you with getting PP funds to begin with. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi everyone, I have a great method to share with you guys, how to get your PP or VCC funds into nice and safe BTC! This is my own method which I kinda stumbled upon more than anything and have been using to change loads of my PP funds into BTC. I have not seen anything else similar to it, and it is completely original material. So why am I sharing? Well the normal worry is that the method gets burned but if you use the tips I provide then that should not be a worry. In fact it dawned on me that the more people who use this method properly, then actually the better and more successful for everyone it will be! Am I nuts? I don't think so. If you decide to buy the guide then you will learn more and I am sure be pleasantly surprised. So what does it do? Its a cool little way to change your PP (or VCC funds) into BTC. Its really quite simple and if you have got to the stage of getting some funds in either of these then you will be able to do this no problem. Its normally quick and easy. So I can use this to cash out CC's? No, not directly. You need to get those funds into a safe PP account. Also don't use the funds transfer services on here to transfer directly. Of course if you have already received funds using one of those services then this is ideal for you. No more worrying about going to the ATM with your Polish IBAN card and trying to hide your face from the cameras. With a little extra step you will also be able to cash out any VCC's you have, so if you are using those Polish ones this is how to get BTC from them. This really is a great way to cash out funds SAFELY. You can start straight away and start changing money with no effort, but I do include advice on doing a few extra bits which will reduce the effective % you pay to change your funds and also allow you to change much larger amounts. I don't know how long I will sell this for, so GET BUYING NOW! http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/9610

[HOT] [REVIEWED]","Guides Vendors","Well, without going into too much detail, the method involves a procedure of PP>X>BTC, where X is his selling point.  To be able do a PP transfer is a must with this method, as it ensures longetivity, and so, it may be less appealing to the newbiest of newbs, but, with this said, it can provide you with a large stable income. I've only tried a small amount of $70, and received Item X within 20 or so minutes, but I'm sure if I searched further, I'm sure I could have gotten more out of my money. In terms of originality, I'd say he's the first to write such a guide concerning X, but the idea has been around for quite some time. The guide is well written and key ideas are explained, but don't expect it to hold your hand throughout the whole process.  Overall, I think the method hits the nail on the head with the price, but as with most guides, requries effort and time. Good luck with sales",""

I've found an alternative website, this will distribute the stress between the websites and will not effect the first 5 buyers. Due to the nature of the companies being carded, the only way this method can be saturated is through financial bankruptcy. By using different sites it prevents that from happening, as long as I can distribute the stress on the companies appropriately, it'll be fine. This method will not be burned fast, the only way it will is if the buyers release it and leak it. By listing the method at such a high price it will prevent the buyers from doing so as it will only burn a hole in their pocket.  Thanks,Gold.

If you are such a mastercarder (for a long time), tell me about the other places you have been before this one month on EVOLUTION, you was the ''elite carder'' from day one here, where did you come from? And on you saying i am a ghostaccount of someone else, I have been a vouched member on TCF for 10x the time you are even KNOWN in this community.  Does everyone remembered that method ALL the noobs did on tcf, that CC/paypal to virwox with like 100 usd profit, very strange that a ELITE/MASTER carder does not understand this method:   (link: http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=298) Another interesting quote:   (link:http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=385) You guys remember the other method ALL the noobs were doing? That paypal-polish anon IBAN. Apparently our own elite carder is trying to do the same for the first time, since he posts more than 10 times about it, I am not going to quote all of those, but check his posts and you will find it. Check fast before he deletes those posts like he did with a couple others. I have screenshotted all the quotes though just in case he deletes them. Also strange that you posted:  (link: http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=350) You are contradicting yourself in ways I never knew lol. Such a master carder. This one cracks me up completely, an elite carder with no experience with (one of) the biggest CC-companies!?!?!?!?:  (link:http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=436)   And LOL at you trying to scam people with a PONZI-scheme/HYIP on a fucking fraud forum.

You could improve on the writing, and give more information (I actually bought it expecting to get info about easy sites to card without cvv, only got one and it may get patched if they catch up people are abusing this), as well as explain it to total noobs instead of believing everyone knows about ""carding terms"". But yeah, I can see this working, and I'll post my success if any. For now, I dont think the price I paid is worth the guide, but we'll see. EDIT: Actually I just check the only two sites he tells you about, and BOTH are not eligible for online delivery because their cards have no pins lol So basically I paid 60$ for a ""go to this site and card"" guide. Well done, me. OP, do you have any other sites that actually work? Too bad I released money already.

Full name2. Date of Birth3. Phone number4. Email (Not necessary)5. Full Address6. Address/tenancy information7. Card issuer, type and level8. Mother's maiden name You will need to put in some time searching the web in order to collect the info but it's all out there and all you need to know is the right places to look. I'll give you those places as well as the best ways to get all the info the pro's give you, and more! You will need to buy subscriptions to these websites but let's be honest, if you're looking for fullz, you'll be carding all of this info, so you'll just need some simple cvv's you can use. Fullz can be used for so much evil; from more informed carding, to Payday or Peer-to-Peer loans, to Account Take Over, to full on identity fraud, with fullz you wield an immense amount of power in your hands.And with a little help/experience/info that you know (and I'll be doing some awesome writeups over the next couple weeks) you'll be ordering Rolex's and 60"" TV's and pulling wads of Â£500 from the ATM without having to fight tooth and nail for a fullz vendor's limited stock. What you need:Working, basic CC info: - Card number, CVV, expiry date, Name. You will need at least one to make the fullz from, and then it'll be worth having some more to buy the subscriptions necessary on these sites without having your real info linked to it.Security: - VM (Virtual Machine) > VPN > SOCKS > CLEAN BROWSER. For a noob friendly and in depth method to creating a perfect security setup check out the guide on my profile. I will help with whatever is related to the guide, but until my other guides on properly using this fullz info are released, I'm not going to help you with how to use them. At the moment it's Â£15 a guide. Any problems hit me up on here, ICQ or TCF. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/21752

For example, if you had their name and found out where they work on somewhere like LinkedIn, you can find their work number, call it off a burner phone and then: - Pretend to be a friend whose found the perfect present for them but you want it to be a surprise and can't remember their birthday.- Say you live in their old house and have some of their mail and need a forwarding address.- Are a friend and need their personal phone number. Those are some pretty uncreative examples, but you find pretty much everything about someone from a tiny piece of info, and my guide will show you the best websites to use and the best ways to get the kind of fullz info you expect from vendors like Kalashnikov.",""

Unless I'm being stupid, surely the only way you could do that would be to have a Ratbot on the victim's computer/phone? You can define fullz as whatever you like, but my method will show you how to get enough information to do an ATO, or at least fool the verification people.You're right on the mark about phishing though, if you're otherwise clueless it's the best way to go. Thanks man, first person to offer so why not? I'll be listening to philmitchell as well and going for a (no offense) more renowned/famed UK carder as well but it'd be cool to get your opinion as well. No, not at all, 99% of the info you can find in the sites I give you. But, the simple fact is that some people, especially older people, just don't have a lot of their information online. You can find most of it in the ways I describe, but worst comes to worst, just straight-up calling/emailing their work or home phone will be the last option.If you're experienced it can be easier to get info this way, but some people are clever enough to keep their details to themselves, and some marks have gotten wary if my call didn't sound genuine, and cancelled their cards just in case. Because of that, I leave phishing as a last resort.","BabyBlue wrote:can it even be considered fullz without vbv|msc password/ways to reset it? I don't think soedit: You want to make your own fullz?

The guide will effectively show you how to gather info such as MMN, DOB, and other details that turn your CC's into fullz, or for those confident enough pass verification when calling the bank. It was funny as I called to change some details on my account IRL just the other week and i wrote down all the security questions they asked me so that I could verify myself.  Had somebody else been impersonating me and they had read this guide, they would have had 0 problem passing all the verification checks, which says it all really.  It works. In terms of content, it's clearly written and straight to the point with information that WILL make a difference.  I don't think the vendor mentions this in the guide, but the sites listed can also be used to check a CC for validity which is an added bonus. At Â£15 you cant go wrong, and it's must for any new carders, particularly as there is a shortage of UK fullz currently.  More experienced UK heads might be familiar with a few of the methods but there's some gems in there for sure.",""

Lets talk lawyers","Security & Anonymity","Ive spent a lot of time learning and reading about OPSEC and correct anonymity protocol, but what I haven't seen much of is conversation about what kind of Lawyer and/or the qualities of said counsel should we be looking for if there is ever a time any of us ever come to a situation where the shit has officially hit the fan. Considering we are all here, this should be something we have all thought about. I may be a newbie to the online world, but crime is not new to me so I know enough to get me started,  but this post is not about what I know, I want the community to speak on this stuff so we can all learn together. Ive taken in a TON of information from you fine mates, and i hope this post will be a way for this n00b to give something back.  A lot of these posts i read are from newbies that very obviously do not have much experience with LE or courts or really any crime other than a little recreational drugs. But we all know how this rabbit hole works.  You might start off buying a G of weed because your regular guy got busted, a few weeks later, you've got CFs, Dumps, or whatever else trouble you can find here. Before you have realized what's happening, you're already over your head.   I'll start it off, and maybe some of the more experienced chaps around here can add some more.    If you are going to make crime a part of your life, have a plan for an attorney.  Never, I repeat NEVER, get stuck with a public defender.  Have someone on retainer.

"Evolution Forums","MartyMcHigh","50445","2015-02-20T09:34:01","Re: BETTER CALL SAUL!!!  Lets talk lawyers","Security & Anonymity","This thread is bang on. Always have a good lawyer on retainer. Do research about your lawyer before going with one. How to research for one: look up all the cases similar to yours (if youre into carding, try and find a lawyer who defended fraud). Make a list of lawyers that had their cases thrown out of court, innocent conviction, or ones that got their clients a reduced sentence (without having to cooperate/snitch). Spend a few weekends interviewing every lawyer. First let them know you have money, then just chit chat with them. Have them tell you stories about cases. Get them to sell you on why they should be your lawyer. Pick the best one, pre-pay the guy and visit him once in awhile.  This gets expensive after awhile. Lawyers tend to love money a lot, and they expect it out of you even just for a chit chat. If they think about you, thats billable time.  So unless you have the money or you're making more than enough from your illicit activities to support a family, you should go with the preventative approach: keeping your fucking mouth shut. When you are arrested, do not fucking say a word. Don't even say ""I dont know what that is!"" just calmly say you don't want to incriminate yourself by accident so the only person you want to say anything to is a lawyer. You should do this either way, public defender or retainer. Every lawyer you talk to will tell you 95% of all cases could've been thrown out or watered down if the indicted had only kept their mouth shut from talking to the police. And that's good advice whether you're factually innocent or guilty. There's been innocent people accidentally jailed for seemingly helping an investigation out. All preventable by not saying anything.",""

Lets talk lawyers","Security & Anonymity","Marty McHigh is exactly right when he says lawyers will tell you 95% of convictions come from the words of the defendant. that was what my first lawyer told me back in the 60's and he got Raymond Patricia off a murder rap in '67. he also got the only acquittal in that famous Brinks robbery that Robert Falk played in the movie. this guy was the real deal. he was a public defender in Boston before he went private. part of the process of selecting a lawyer depends on the judicial system where you are located. in Mass they have Superior Courts where felony cases are tried. the Superior Court judges rotate around the state. one tactic that this lawyer used was to keep continuing a case until he got a favorable judge. of course you have to consider as well that this is Boston so in 90% of the cases a payoff is possible. in addition to not talking he gave me 2 other pieces of advice - (2)only ctiminals work at night - you can get away with anything at 9:00 AM - all the cops are drinking coffee and eating donuts. this was particularly true in my case as we were drug dealers - so don't do deals at night. (3) if you get arrested there is always a record of it somewhere - even if you are acquitted and have the record expunged.  over the years i have made the careers of many lawyers, not from my cases but from but from my referrals to them. one trick that lawyers hardly ever use that has saved my ass twice, is to hire a court reporter for the low court hearing, usually called a probable cause hearing to see if there is enough evidence to send the case to the grand jury and also to trial (it almost always goes in favor of the state) but the hearing is the first time th cop tells his side of the story and he hasn't usually had time to be coached by the prosecutor, because he doesn't know the facts either. so he will often testify truly and many times he made legal mistakes during the arrest. also it may be many months before the case goes to trial and the cop may change his story from what's in that original transcript (he doesn't have a copy of it) so he gets caught in a lie and his whole testimony is rendered useless. in my cases, in the first one i had $8,000 and 30 ounces of pot. at prelim the lawyer asked the cop if i had any explanation for the cash. the cop testified that i said part of it was mine and the rest i had borrowed from my mother to buy a car. in the high court the lawyer asked him the same question and the cop said i had no explanation for it. the lawyer pounced on him so hard that the judge granted my motion to strike and i was acquitted without even having to present evidence. the second case was a DUI in 84 - i was broke nut i got $350 to pay the court reporter and acted as my own lawyer. i knew i would be convicted, so i asked that cop every question the judge would let me. well i got some money together and hired a lawyer for the trial court and in the transcript the cop had said when he pulled pulled up to the scene i was already in handcuffs by the car. so the lawyer pointed out that if that was the case then the cop didn't see me drive the car - which of course is a necessary element of a DUI case - they have to prove you were driving. so the case got tossed. having a court reporter also keeps that low court judge honest (cuts down on the snide remarks, etc) because he knows that his rulings will probably be subject to review and may even make it into a law book somewhere. as a normal rule, unless it's a million dollar case a lawyer won't order a reporter. that's because they are egotistical and think their skill is enough, the client doesn't have the money, or finally if he order a reporter every time it would probably piss the judge off. but insist on - the lawyer will be glad you did later. you have to understand lawyers are a weird breed - they stick together - and other lawyers are good when they suck. besides the lawyer you need to look at the court system - is it corrupt. if so a bribe does the trick. be advised that most of the money gets passed around in the low court - with the prosecutor and/or the judge. but don't take a public defender unless you have to. some of them are excellent lawyers - it's just that their caseload is so large they don't have time to investigate each case, so they turn into Monty Hall and 'Let's Make a Deal'.",""

You can't talk your way outta anything & you can't explain your side - you only make your attorneys job harder. When the alphabet boys called me b4 I was under a federal indictment in the past I said simply ""I will not be meeting with you or answering any questions. Please contact my retained attorney Mr. Attorney at xxx-xx-xxxx, enjoy your day"" to their asses. I second you on always get a court reporter @ popadoppalus - & if you feel confident go to trial. i have never plead to a case either. I've even had federal charges dropped. If every1 would stop pleading the system would literally collapse. All attorneys know this though - particularly prosecutors. It cost alot of money to go to trial - & alot of times we do not understand the intricate details of how this all works. When choosing an attorney I advise every1 to always feel a lawyer out & no that they will do their job which is to DEFEND TO THE END. The lawyer I've used & have on retainer is Bruce Harvey - he has been held in contempt for not rolling on a client & been under grand jury scrutiny. I get a warm & fuzzy feeling when I speak with him about issues & I can be honest with him because he needs to know if I did the shyt & no one can prove it, if I did it & there is proof or I have no idea what those idiots r talking about so that he can bluff the AUSA or not. I only choose litigators when choosing an attorney whether trial is imminent or not - I say that because every attorney is not a litigator or viable opponent to the prosecution. For example, Federal Defenders Meet'em & Plead'em. My motto & alot of other folks is: If you can't do the time don't do the crime. Surely you know the consequences if caught up.",""

It may be painful but facing up to the charges and possible punishments is the first step in delivering you through the ordeal. Attorneys are there for precisely this reason. They have specific qualifications (and you should be encouraged to ask for their credentials before engaging their services) and experience in various fields. Enquire as to this experience and areas of expertise so that your attorney has a track record that suggests they can help you. For example, if you are accused of breaking a state law, hire a state attorney rather than a federal one.Although, arguably, just as important as a history of work in your type of case is how you personally feel about them. The result is what matters, but trust is essential in such personal matters. Your livelihood and reputation are on the line. A great criminal defense attorney will respect this, encouraging a two-way street of trust and openness. This entails you being frank and giving them every chance to get you on the right side of the courtâs decision. Your attorney should be a brilliant communicator, not just in court but also with you and your family.Make sure your criminal defense attorney belongs to the County and State Bar Associations. More qualified attorneys may also belong to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers or the ABAâs Criminal Justice Section. Discover what school they went to and how highly their qualification is respected in the field. Some attorneys have taught at law school, which requires high discipline and work, so can often be a bonus.Some major cities or states have criminal defense lawyer associations. These can be an excellent starting point to choose your attorney. Cost could well be high, so work out up front what method of payment works best for your situation. Meet your lawyer and then find out who, in addition to them, will be working your case. What happens if the attorney gets sick or becomes suddenly unavailable?Your attorney will be looking to identify the key issues of the case, issue motions to support you and defend your rights at every stage. They will be negotiating and seeking every little piece of information to give them leverage for you.When making the important decision of which criminal defense attorney will represent you or your loved one, ask them about a similar case that they have handled in the past. Even if the verdict wasnât what you want to hear, did they do their best possible for their client. Do they have validated testimonials from satisfied clients that were in just the same situation you are now? Thatâs what matters most."

Bigmeesh's 1st cashout with one of the gateways you will learn about was $1500 and that was as easy as 123 his 1st week andmost importantly his 1st attempt and he made a nice amount, which was just a small potential of what you can make just with ONE of these gold mines.  3 gateways with full instructions of setup, carding and cashing out plus tips and tricks for eachAll plugins and addons for the gatewaysMy own method of obtaining ""Bank Drops"" cardless fast and no drop required for quick lower cashouts Like i have already mentioned Bigmeesh made $1500 on his 1st cashout in the 1st week of use, which is a low amount but a good startwith these gateways you can make up to 5k on your 1st cashout.  Yes i have limited the sales of package... only a limited copies of V1 will be sold and only to members i feel eligible, this will be a private sale with full escrow of course .  This will no longer be a ""guide"" this will be live tutoring from myself via ICQ or Jabber (OTR) Site and Hosting Setup/Design TutoringGateway Setup TutoringGateway Carding TutoringObtaining Cardless Bank Drop Tutoring The 1st week will generate a ROI from my tutoring and also materials required, if you run multiple sites at the same time you can make ROI+Profit in the 1st week.

This is someone who i even gave a vault market invitation to try out their cards. Sterling has no listings anymore so it's now a matter of finding what works for you from other vendors. @ First, i can 'prolly' bet that your grammar is way inferior to mine, as well as your educational standards. First class troll. @badger3, you can be sure that upon the first successful confirmation here on evo, it won't be going for any less than 5btc upfront.

Do that for that reason3. Then do this4. Then do that5. Lastly this6. ???7 Profit However, price tag is 25 BTC - this is concerning because I think that if you significantly reduced the price you would sell this.

I took a copy, looked at the content, how it was written and theory behind it. It looked good. I never said I tested, I never said it worked.

This guide had content and wasn't structured in this way and that's what I complimented, that is all. No guide is worth 25BTC, 10BTC or even 5BTC. The reason being any guide that could earn you that in a few days, you wouldn't be selling it. Fact.  OP was a good sales man pure and simple. I may have a chat with other members of staff regarding ""pricey guides"" and suggest some sort of verification be but in place.","weightedb wrote:Well guys I think we can chalk this one up as a valuable lesson.  Just because a Mod, Admin, or reputable person says it looks good in theory, doesn't speak for actually doing it and if it is worth the cost.  Although I understand that's all SF could really say at the time and that there is no blame to him, I think from now on we should be looking for vouched reviews of actual personal success with the methods being sold.  Atleast that's what I will be looking for before I drop money on higher priced guides."

I think many people here read just what they wanted to read, and not that he actually didn't test it.  Nonetheless we should learn from that because what happened can't be reversed.  I advise the admins to create a standard for testing cash out methods to avoid misunderstandings and other problems. (E.g. like yasuo did with different criteria and stars like 4 out of 5, sth. like this)I think on the bottom line it should always stand explicitly if the person has cashed out or not.

Here is a freebie of getting btc through reddit. Now I never tested this, so I cannot vouch for it. However, it's free so feel free to give it a shot  Enjoy! First, get a card, make an account on reddit, make an account on DogeVault, and make an account on Cryptsy (https://www.cryptsy.com/). Next, visit /r/dogemarket and find someone selling dogecoins through either Skrill (for credit cards) or PayPal (if you're using a PayPal account). Contact them through the PM system and let them know that you're interested in buying. Pay them whatever they ask, the important part is just that you get them to agree to sell you the coins. (Many people on /r/dogemarket are cautious about selling to brand new accounts due, in part, to scams like this.) Have the person send the coins to your DogeVault account's recieving address. Then use the send function on DogeVault's site to send the coins to your Crypsty Dogecoin address. Place a Doge->BTC sell order. Then simply withdraw the bitcoins you just bought with the dogecoins. Launder them as you see fit and either spend them as bitcoins or cash them out however you like. (I recommend LocalBitcoins for cashing out coins.)",""

They teach a very good method and I highly recommend it as someone who, prior to the tutoring, has not really had much success with cashing out CVVs. I got the level 2 tutoring which includes the information taught in level 1 and the cash out guide, with the added bonus of learning how to get up to $3000 per account. A great deal considering it only cost $100 more than level 1. alphawolf89 walked me through their method while holding my hand the entire way, figuratively of course . They never left me behind in the dust or got mad at me for asking noobish questions. They gave me the necessary accounts required for their method and also gave me their supplier's information. They taught me step by step how to set up the accounts, cash out the cards, and finally cash out the accounts themselves.  The most amazing thing about alphawolf89, though, was their professionalism. I burned 2 accounts during the tutoring with bad cards (they were from an auto shop ) and they just laughed it off and gave me new ones to try.  Overall the best experience I've had with a vendor and a service that I highly recommend.  PS. Get some real cards before starting because that can be the most time intensive part. I recommend Heinrich for cards since his are the cheapest with the highest limits (and the only ones that were actually valid/worked.)",""

I'm looking at you, Alpha.  To cut to the chase: this is absolutely one of the most worth-while purchases you can make on Evo, or any market for that matter. Alpha spares no expense with this tutoring, and will stick with you to make sure you're successful. It's been weeks since I took his session, and we still talk regularly and answers any questions I manage to throw at him. He's just an overall good guy, and still maintains a high level of professionalism. Now I can't speak for everyone, but I've personally had a huge amount of success with this. Thus far (over the span of a little over two weeks) I've managed to make approximately 4-5k in cash-in-hand, and have around another 2k in items that I can sell. Additionally, I actually managed to SE my way into acquiring a Rolex, that has a value thats even more than what I've made so far; if I were to sell that, it'd put my earning from this tutoring around 15k USD. Keep in mind that this is in the span of two or so weeks. Now obviously everyone has different capabilities when it comes to SE, so a Rolex may not be in the cards for everyone, but there's absolutely no doubt that anyone who takes this course will see a high level of success regardless. I can ramble all day about how extraordinary this tutoring is, but the simple fact of the matter is this: If you're looking to make thousands of percent ROI, this is the one, no-bullshit service you should purchase.  tl;drTake the tutoring  I'd be willing to answer any questions anyone has for me if you need some more first-hand examples of how well this works, so hit me up if you do. Take the opportunity that Alpha is offering here, and go make some real money.",""

They teach a very good method and I highly recommend it as someone who, prior to the tutoring, has not really had much success with cashing out CVVs. I got the level 2 tutoring which includes the information taught in level 1 and the cash out guide, with the added bonus of learning how to get up to $3000 per account. A great deal considering it only cost $100 more than level 1.alphawolf89 walked me through their method while holding my hand the entire way, figuratively of course . They never left me behind in the dust or got mad at me for asking noobish questions. They gave me the necessary accounts required for their method and also gave me their supplier's information. They taught me step by step how to set up the accounts, cash out the cards, and finally cash out the accounts themselves. The most amazing thing about alphawolf89, though, was their professionalism. I burned 2 accounts during the tutoring with bad cards (they were from an auto shop ) and they just laughed it off and gave me new ones to try. Overall the best experience I've had with a vendor and a service that I highly recommend.PS. Get some real cards before starting because that can be the most time intensive part. I recommend Heinrich for cards since his are the cheapest with the highest limits (and the only ones that were actually valid/worked.)"

I am seling a private method that can help your multiply any ammount of bitcoin to a much higher number. We're talking turning $50 into $500 into $5000.  The method is completely unsaturated, completely safe, guaranteed profit. So do I need phone numbers, emails, personal data for this? Absolutely not! The method only requires a bitcoin address with some bitcoin on it. You can start from any ammount you want, $1, $10, $50, etc. The possibilites are endless. This method can realise you financial independence if done right. Currently selling only 2 methods for a ridiculously price of 0.5 BTC!!!!!! I'm selling the method so cheap because I like helping people and I want you to try my method! I can guarantee that you will positively vouch for my method!

"Evolution Forums","Yasuo","30005","2014-10-29T01:00:09","[ULTIMATE] Paypal Guide v4.5 // STATUS: Available // [1/10]","Guides Vendors","GUIDE INFORMATION:Most of the basic information you need to know regarding Paypal is included in this version. It also has v3.0 and my SE guide to help you make your money back. Remember, this guide doesn't generate you money. It's still all up to you on how hard you work on it. The methods will be saturated, however, you can use them as 'guidelines' so you can be creative and find more methods on your own. The best methods are the ones that no one knows about. The sale is publicly open for everyone. However, only 50 will be eligible for future updates. MARKETPLACE LISTING:http://kjj2txjneira6koo.onion/listing/21242If you do not use the same contingency link as I do, please copy ""/listing/21242""(without quotes) and paste it at the end of your marketplace link. PRICE:FIRST 10 - $650SECOND 10 - $750REMAINING 30- $850To all 50 buyers, I will make sure you get your money back. I will make you understand how the system works so you can do them yourselves afterwards. SUPPORT: OzzyzIf you have any questions/inquiries regarding the guide, please contact Ozyzz and he will answer your questions. Please refrain from asking unnecessary or irrelevant questions. Thank you. He's pretty eligible for the support position because he's fairly good with Paypal and his bank accounts would work well for your cashout. UPDATE:Updates will be available once every 50 spots are filled. Next version will be v5.0. So stay tuned.

I've been a member of this forum only for a short period of time. I've also had a break from carding for almost 1 year. Frankly I haven't even started back up again.. Just exploring what's new and what's old.. I came to this forum for a few weeks ago and came to realize what a great and social forum this is, I was absolutely sold lol.. Back in 2012 when PayPal's security measures was not so strict it was way more easier to transfer funds from 1 Account to another without having to see the today-common error message.. I did A LOT of trial & error on my own until my friend joined up.. We managed to card a lot of money and bought us some in-game gold through different sites, which we then sold and got our-self some nice (back in the days) LR (Liberty Reserve) money, we made a few K's but we also stopped when we were on top. Now you might wonder why I tell you all this, is just to share you my previous experience even though I am new here I am not a newbie.. I wish to get back into the game but this time save me some time and money without having to do all the trial & error again..

At the moment, I can only send to my accounts because of the gateways that I enabled them to which is not available for everyone unless you actually apply for it in Paypal.

Once you purchase, you will receive a code from me. You need to save that code. As soon as the 50 copies are sold, I will start working on the new design for v4.7 + v5.0. To be able to purchase those updates, you will have to provide me your code. I currently have v7.3a. v4.7 covers the new aspect for the modern way of sending transfers. v5.0 covers the revolutionary 1-4-16-1 method which guarantees you to make $10,000/day. I will also provide the financial schedule that was designed in Excel so you would understand when, where, and how to cashout easily. Once I'm done selling v7.3a to the public, I will introduce you people to a very very very easy payment processor that works like Paypal(have accounts, bank accounts, etc). This has been working very nice for me lately. I'm new to it. It's a rather new processor but it's easy to bypass. The payment gateway is non-avs like Paypal but it's not strict at all. These payment processor is one of the top in the list in terms of eCurrency Trading [payment processor - BTC].

I read about a bunch of methods online. Look up carding or credit card fraud.  Pretty sure its straight forward. I'll write you up a guide right now to save you some money. Physical Method 1: Skimming (not the best because they will eventually find a pattern, people carding at a certain store) You could skim the cards and wait a good 90 days, because most records are only kept for that period of time.  A. Buy credit card scanner and writerB. Find job at MceeDeesC. Ask to work at the drive throughD. Scan cards as people give them to youE. Quit job and find job at Wendys. F. Repeat C, D, E, and finally F Method 2: Attach skimmer to gas pump or ATM A. Buy credit card scanner and writerB. Buy a small motion activated camC. Find a gas pump or ATM in a public place but not so public. D. Attach the device so it scans cards while you sleep, eat and shit. E. Place cam near device so it can record PINs F. Wait a couple days and go pick it up Method 3: Phishing A. Buy prepaid burner phoneB. Find phone bookC. Call everyone in the phone book and ask them to donate or purchase somethingD. Log information as they provide it to you  Digital Method 1: Fake website A. Buy domain and create a fake business websiteB. Pay to advertise your fake ass websiteC. Make sure you sell crazy awesome shit cheapD. Log all their information and save it to a file or email it to yourselfE. Make sure you send them a confirmation emailF. Send them an email and say you're out of stock due to cheap prices Method 2: Use computer skills",""

Two good responses! If you're a regular buyer, and somehow get on the cops radar, you're gonna be fucked whether you pick up this package or not. The ""come pick it up"" post card is entirely common. You already spun the wheel when the vendor wrote your address on the package.  Go pick it up. Remember, the only thing that truly protects us is the anonymity of volume. The cops are lucky if they can clue in to 0.001% of packages shiped. If you happen to fall into that unlikely percentage -- sorry, you're screwed -- it's the chance we all take. Right now, I've got a priority mail package that's been ""in-transit"" for 7 days. You think I'm not worried? But, what am I gonna do? If the feds picked it up and opened it, they know where it was going. Ain't shit I can do about it now.

If people were getting busted regularly for having contraband delivered it would be all over the news. The postal staff don't give a shit - rarely ask for ID if you have the slip - they just want your package delivered. Signing for something doesn't mean you are admitting anything - particularly if the package is not in your name. I've signed for misdelivered packages all the time. Its usually neighbors or previous occupants (although may be they were drugs packages hah!). Worse case scenario is the package has split (they'd be really unlikely to open domestic mail on purpose) and you never receive your package (more likely) or you get a visit from police to 'discuss' your delivery. Even if you did they can't prove the package was yours and you never received the package so what's the crime? Really they'd have to stake you out let you get the contraband and then catch you with it but given the small quantities its not worth it. So they'll either not bother and destroy it or perhaps visit you to scare you off doing it again (would probably work for me hah). I mean even if Evo/vendors got busted and you'd been dumb about your security and they got your address that would only given them reasonable grounds to search your property but they probably wouldn't bother with you but even if they did they'd only prosecute you if they found contraband (there's no such crime as conspiracy to BUY drugs). All the money time and resources is spent on the suppliers and even IRL the police will only go for consumers where its an easy win, i.e. if you're in the wrong place and the wrong time.",""

They check to see if its a valid address that its being sent to, who is the person and sometimes the inspectors start getting suspicious and pop box's. Depending on which provider is used. Don't take this as 100% valid information as this is just what I heard from someone else. If anyone that has worked a job at a post office, please verify. In my eyes it looks bad to leave a package there, not go pick it up and have other packages that contain drugs in route. Just a personal thing.","Funkypurpletits wrote:hdmi wrote:.

You can really scam a wanna be criminal a whole lot of money  Depends how good you can advertise. Best advice for some darknet scammers is creating a onion site that displays electronics as products and ""sell them"", but one thing I won't do is show how to scam on this market or others because that really would get annoying, and to much time. Everyone who has msg me about how to make money on this market or similar. Please know that I can not hold your hand. You have to provide a service or do some co-op. ""Carding"" Just go card Bestbuy.com! (Use one CC or debit to buy one small item like an USB 16gb or 32gb) Send it to your drop, then turn around and re-sell that item that you have carded on Ebay!

"Evolution Forums","Gold","2130","2014-02-10T21:34:12","CLOSED","Guides Vendors","Hello Evolution, After my 800USD highly controversial yet highly successful private method, I've decided to encore with both a service and method which I've been prototyping and adapting for months now. I'm in hope that I'll be able to dominate the transfer market and provide a high quality and lasting service. I've spent tons of time perfecting my offerings and becoming familiar with the behavior of the websites involved, these are adaptations of my personal ventures which worked perfectly. Current Rate: 30% Amounts$45 BTC = $200 PayPal$90 BTC = $300 PayPal$150 BTC = $500 PayPal$300 BTC = $1,000 PayPal Why my transfers are high quality1. I use credit card BINS with no online banking, charge back will only occur when they read their monthly statement2. I use fake invoicing and a variety of security precautions to create the illusion of authentic payments3. Unlike other vendors, I am aware of how PayPal behaves to an extreme extent. For example, I've seen other vendors send 2 payments to total the amount, this not only sets off alarms but adds additional liabilities 4. My funds are washed through a third party payment processor, creating a somewhat transparent trail4. I'm online all day, every day What is a transfer service? - A transfer service is the converting of BTC to PayPal funds at an extremely discounted rate. Put simply, you will pay me 30% of the amount you require transferred, I'll then transfer that amount to the desired PayPal where you can cash out using either your personal methods or mine.  What if a charge back occurs? - Using my method, the funds only have to last 2 days until they're untouchable. If you receive a charge back within 3 days I'll send you another transfer of the same value, free of charge. What if PayPal limits or blocks my funds? - With small amounts such as $300, you'll have no trouble cashing out without obstruction when using my method. For higher amounts, I recommend using aged accounts that can be purchased from marketplace vendors. I will only take responsibility for chargebacks, not locked accounts, that's an issue with your account creation/security. Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/2290 Please Note: This transfer service is built to work with my cash out method, it is expandable to the extent of Â£1k revenue a week, I cannot vouch for any other methods. That being said, if your method works with other transfer services, it'll work with mine. I personally use this method to clear 1K profits a week with 3 days of light work. It is designed to work in collaboration with my transfer service and has a high success rate. I personally love this method because it uses a processor which clears millions of payments daily, meaning us fraudsters can easily blend in and make a small fortune.  Contents-Preparing-Gaining the money-Security-Cashing out-Laundering-Sustainability The method requires a strict weekly timetable. You will be transferring up to $900 a day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, then you'll cash out on Sunday and start the process again. The method is easily expandable if you can handle the work load.  Price: 100USD Guaranteed make your money back or receive a refund. Listing: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/2296

(they are probably still there) if you run VM on RAM drive should be no traces. i am personally against encrypting the complete hard drive. in my opinion it only shows that you have something to hide. 128GB USB sticks are cheap and common now - you can run 10 VMs and still have plenty for storage. let your wife of kids or siblings or whoever play all they want to on Facebook, etc. it will just look like a normal pc. keep your USB stick well hidden (easy to do they are so small). you can make them readonly - so no malware can be injected - run everything in RAM - do your check sums before and after. i started working on analyzing this DBAN option, but haven't gotten past the point where it is supposed to supply orange level security according to DOD standards which was same standard for NTFS that lasted about a week. if it takes  3 hours to image a disc - how can DBAN wipe it out in seconds - especially since it has to boot which takes at least 30 seconds. if your box is 100% encrypted it looks like you have something to hide. Moreover, courts have forced defendants to provide access under threat of jail for contempt. if you are in jail then encryption doesn't help you. i think the fake password ruse is gone as well. i just prefer plain vanilla boxes. my wife gets on facebook, my grandaughter watches netflix, my daughter reads her emails. i have several projects i am working on now including being able to connect to internet with spoofed ip. it's like security guru bruce she----whateverhisnameis said - if the NSA wants in your box - then they are in. all the proxies and vpns and rdps do no good in the world if someone is looking over your shoulder.","Cypher wrote:But about what you said about the RAM.

People that steal other peoples work for profit. Not guide sellers. I myself wrote a successful guide on here and made quite a lot on it. You're not selling your own guides, so don't big yourself up. You're selling a guide you stole. End of story.  And people that give it the ""I make this much money I own this and that"" bollocks rarely make shit. You wouldn't be selling fucking bitcoin keys if you made any sort of money. I'm pretty sure you posted the other day ""I made my first grand from using this guide"". Now you're a baller.

I would not recommend this for some for the older members here as you may have seen this guide before.Ufortunately contrary to the title this is not a ""pretty new method"" although it may still work (been a while since I tried)~Andigatel"

I would even say that to get any money at all you'll need to be very lucky and spend hours at your computer, and even then you can end up with nothing.He kinda made it sound easier, better and much more effective than it actually is.He described it as a non-saturable method at the beggining (not true), easy to start (but to buy some of the necessary shit to get it done you will need a visa, and it might be a prob for some), and lately he claims that some ppl made it after 20 tries, other after 50 and some only  made any money after hustling like 300 users. So not so pretty as he paints it. I have given it a try for some time, and haven't managed to get a single cent.Apparently there were not many ppl that successfully made it, cause nobody posted anything.Not saying it isn't possible, just saying it is pretty harder than he says and you will need a lot of time invested and a looooooooot of luck.",""

The guide is in its original format from the original author from where I last saw it but that does not deter from the fact that this is some good info that would not only work on localbitcoins but on a few bitcoin trading sites that rely on external payment solutions. Essentially what this guide is a framework for noobs to think outside the box and attempt to pull of a scam that could see them generate some coin to buy some cc's or whatever they please. I would not recommend this for some for the older members here as you may have seen this guide before.

This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, even though you do get rich quick from carding. It's science, critical thinking, and investment. And it's put together and explained well so that new people can learn carding. With my guide, somebody new could learn this stuff really fast and start carding and earn 10k/week easy in their first week.  This is especially great for people who have tried carding and just can't get the hang of it.

Total cost is $295 for a 3 hour session via jabber or ICQ. 3 spots are available each week. I think it's best to have a 2 hour consultation, then we follow up for an hour once things are in motion. It's ultimately up to you. The sessions will focus around real world examples of JungleMoney. You'll get a copy of the updated guide and I will show you how/where to get everything else. We'll cover the following -- - Creating PayPal accounts- Creating your cash out route(s)- Your Operation- Asset Protection $295 http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/84516 Nearly everything we'll use is available on Evolution. I have a preferred list of vendors that I work with on a regular basis but I will include some bonuses with our session so we can get moving as as quickly as possible. Expect to spend around $1,850 for each bank drop. No, it can't be ""cheaper"". If you have access to other drops, go for it. But the total cost of our operation is around $2,350, not including my fee, that will get plastic in your hands and enough resources to make something worthwhile. - You will need an Amazon Web Services account -- http://aws.amazon.com/- Bank drops are EU only. Not Polish.- You'll need a burner phone with the Google Voice application. You should have a general understanding of networking technologies such as VPN, RDP, SOCKS5.

Thanks as always.  Let me know if ya'll have questions.

First, OP sent me the second edited copy with the suggestions I've made.  Setting Up the Scam:Yeah, web designers and people with a more tech side on their skills, will have more advantage on setting up the scam. Although if you don't have the web design experience, there's a lot of 5 minute How To youtube videos for it, and you'll be gaining skills for future things. You'll need to card a webhosting to get the main tools for the setup. The OP missed to point out for the noobs, that you can buy the tools with bitcoin too if you don't get to card the webhosting site. Applying the Scam:Ok, the flesh of the guide is here, if you never scammed people and want to try it, looking for returns from $100-$1500 maybe more depending on victim, this is a good method that worths the $29 that costs. It even will point you to a cool browser trick that you'll find using it in other aspects of scam life. CONCLUSIONSThe idea seems easy to apply and to replicate, so with one setup, you should be doing several attempts a day. I would like that OP could tell us past experiences with this scam.Yeah, like rellyromero, I don't see where can I apply this method for starting a transfer service, as you won't have paypal funds. You're scamming for merchandise being shipped without paying.

I have made at least 20k using only ""the LB scam"" and ""the grand paypal scam"" and yeah yeah, everyone can say they made this and that. so you could decide to take my word 4 it, if not! i cant say i blame you, i probably wouldn't believe me either. But the thing is, this is like ANY other regular day-job. to make money you have to invest some work to get payed. But whats really grate about the methods is that you can do it all in the own comfort of your home, only using 3-4 hours a day 3-4 days a week.  so if you got NO ambitions, no drive or no common sense, please dont buy my products. @Yasou yeah i can se where you are coming from. But the thing is i dont respond good to threats nor do i appreciate illiterate scum bitching about a method that ""wont work"" when im sitting here almost as we speak on LBC ""buying btc"" with a tweaked paypal method(also explaned how to do in the the grand paypal hustle)  and the total worthless pedophile Purgate i even sent a bonus before he started lashing out with his retard behavior, but he just wanted a freebee and was bitching on the forum, never made a dispute dough. but appreciate that you want to learn daddy how to fuck bro  hehe just kidding. thanx mate and im looking foreword to try out your review service

He photoshopped some PMs with some broken-worded threats, something about the pedo scene, and has been talking about it ever since. I have no idea what half of what he says means, I can only assume he is projecting. The fact he knows so much about the pedo scene is worrisome. I do pity their affliction as you have said, however any acting out of fantasies is inarguably highly damaging to the other party involved, ergo offenders must serve the gravest sentence the law of the land permits. The defense of pedophilia is an offense to our children and future generations of our kind.

Or if its even just about braking it down to the most simple 3-step method on how to get fucking paid. That is what i will do!.  so why am i doing this? is this a trick to sell in new shit or even try to squeeze more money out of you guys. WRONG AND WRONG My soul purpose with selling guides in here is that they actually work, and that i have experienced them myself, successfully of-course. So what im gonna do is -set up a list of all my "" The grand paypal hustle"" customers-help every one of you to collect some serious cash-cross of every name if the customer i successfully helped, until i have helped at least 9/10(theres always some lazy crack addict or some retarded purgate that never in a million years could be successful in ANYTHING they fucking do. so that's why i make it 9/10)  The list of the customers buying one of the most profitable guides on here: elmachico777  âjim456789 âââputinwork62 âââDoubled69 âââDnm_toto âDarcy ââârgrath âââRGHLMNQ âââVelvern âââjackbarron âââDhaerow âââmigoss ââânyarlathotech âââMariano88 âââfawkes âââDaVinci âââpea_king2 ââ The ones that bought this in a custom listing, or that i havent added(couple of you know you are not on this list 4 obvious reasons)can send me a pm and i will add you among the others. the names will remain RED until they have at leeeeast ROI. After helping YOU get your money, i would really appreciate some feedback in this listing :D  When i have successfully reached my goal of 9/10 customers with huge profit using my method i will add another 20 copy`s at the same ridicules low price of 30$. When i sold out that batch i will set up a list of customers, and do the hole quality-control thing all over. Just to make sure my guides is NOT just guides, they are pure methods of getting payed  (anyone want there name taken down, or any other questions or what not just pm me, if you dont respond on my message, i will try again. if i get no respons i will take your name down and give the opportunity to someone that deserves it)    Like i said, i got capacity to take on 10 more customers because of the ones i excluded from this opportunity so if you haven't had a looksie yet, then make sure you do :D ----->>>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The method is still being done with a awesome success rate, so i will be adding 10 new copies and update you guys daily on the status of the hustle :D------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is your âstepBYstepâ guide on how to make your wallet pregnant, and stay that way 4 a loooot longer then 9 months :D.

If you say you only sell 10 copies and 5 are only left, it's implying a point that you only have a limited time left to be able to obtain this wonderful product. However, only stupid people fall for this. Real vouches, real stories, and real outcomes are concrete evidences. If you have read highasakite's post, after he sells the last 5 copy, he will sell this again. So basically, this limited copies left thing is utter marketing bullshit. The real hustles are not for sale. The real hustles are not even talked about publicly until they are exposed. Check out www.krebsonsecurity.com. Did you people even hear about Boletos? Those fucking brazilian hustlers who never sold a single eBook in their lives are now millionaires. That's a real hustle. Another good example are the IBAN cards. Before these cards were for sale, a lot of people were making a fortune in Paypal using these cards. And look what happened now, almost all mBanks/IBAN BINs are now blacklisted.

Try the instructions on this page: http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/99 Did you not research this device prior to purchasing it? Hardware usually does not come with Linux drivers, and it is up to you to ensure that the device will work before you buy it. The Huawei page includes some drivers only available as source code -- in order to get this device to work, you may have to compile the drivers yourself. Are you up to that?  If the device doesn't work, you may actually be better off. Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead using such a device to access the Darknet.  Fantino

I done the PP>BTC method and it worked and I had my code within a few hours, I have not tired the CC>BTC method but will give it a go when ThinkingForward sends over my cards and will update here so you guys know   As Nancy said it is only a $100 limit but I guess you can buy multiple times so it's not much effort at all.  The only downfall to this is it most probably will be burnt quickly so if I was you I personally wouldn't have released it as you would have been able to get more out of it but regardless thanks for the vouch copy. HashishUK Edit: Had cards from ThinkingForward And non of them are passing the $10 bitcoin card, attempted 3 cards which I was comfortable with the socks5 as the other 2 we're out of range for VIP72.

He's also facing six months in prison for refusing to hand over the encryption keys to police during the course of an investigation. Wilson first found himself on the wrong side of the long arm of the law in October of 2012. At the time, he was suspected of emailing threats to the vice chancellor of Newcastle University, where he was working towards a master's degree, in which he promised to shoot members of the school's staff. The messages were able to be traced to servers that were connected to Wilson, but the allegations could never be substantiated and the charges were eventually dropped. But not before police confiscated several pieces of computer equipment from his home. Wilson's legal troubles continued. Although charges were dropped in the Newcastle case, he became a suspect in a second set of threats made against the Northumbria police. In particular, he was suspected of calling and warning of an impending cyber attack, of attempting to break into the Serious Organised Crime Agency's website and of encouraging people to deface a Facebook memorial page set up for a pair of officers shot in Manchester. As part of the investigation, police wanted to look at encrypted data stored on Wilson's computer. But the password he gave them didn't work. In fact, he provided investigators with 50 passwords, none of which turned out to be correct. So police turned to the courts, which compelled him to provide the correct key to decrypt the data in the interest of national security. Since Wilson refused to comply, he was sentenced to six months in prison under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, or RIPA, the UK's wiretapping law. Of course, it would seem a stretch that such threats would fall under the guise of terrorism and national security, which the particular provisions of RIPA are meant to investigate.",""

"Evolution Forums","popadoppalus","16243","2014-07-10T14:46:21","Re: LE tries to force release of encryption key","Security & Anonymity","well in US they have had cases where they lock people up for failing to give up passwords, or combinations to safes, etc. i have read forensic bulletins where they know that there are fake partitions and they have tools that can show them the size of of the media, etc. so they can tell when something exists that they are not able to access. that's why i recommend saving everything sensitive on small removale media - USB stick or SD. the raspberry pi actually uses an SD chip for the OS and storage and there are instructions all over the place on how to configure one to be a TOR server. but if they are in your house they probably already have cause without even accessing your data. the best thing is to use removable media and stash it where it can't be found. do those people that swallow SD (micro i hope) chips retrieve them when they come out. i have been working on computers for years, i probably have 10 working systems running, hundreds of hard drives both used and new and thousands of CD/DVD with data stored on them - maybe 30 SD chips and probably 100 USB sticks.

So maybe the password is not in clear text in RAM, but I guess that the encryption key is  and this allows Passware to perform the decryption.      PM_SQ    Senior Member          http://gse-compliance.blogspot.com/2009/12/quick-and-nasty-overview-of-finding.html  <<<<this shows that LE is well aware of the dual passwords in TrueCRYPT>>>>>><<<<go to this URL to see screen shots>>>>>>        ednesday, 23 December 2009Quick and Nasty overview of finding TrueCrypt volumes Quick and Nasty overview of finding TrueCrypt volumes Registry analysis should be conducted on the system for the HDD Image. This can help  determine if the images have the following characteristics that allow for an analysis of the  partitions that can be utilised to determine the existence of a hidden partition:     RAM Slack Fragments exist on the main drive images.    Registry calls to other drives exist.    Correct Defragmentation processes have not been followed to the specifications required  by TrueCrypt.    System artefacts for the TrueCrypt Drives â such as ones mapped as âPâ, âQâ, and âZâ . Tests of the Entropy of both a bitwise and bytewise stream need to be conducted and mapped,  where Entropy is the relative randomness of a given data unit. When a hidden volume is mounted, the operating system and third-party applications may write  to non-hidden volumes information about the data stored in the hidden volume (e.g.  filenames). An analysis of the pagefile on the image may uncover artefacts of a TrueCrypt  volume. TrueCrypt can be configured to use two (2) separate passwords. The first will open  an encrypted but obvious volume. The second is used for a hidden volume that is designed to  remain undetected if the first password becomes known to a third party. Opening the TrueCrypt partition further allows for the analysis of the partition (if you get  an outer password). This can provide evidence that can demonstrate a hidden partition has  been created within the outer partition: Â· System artefacts and registry entries may point to this drive. The volume serial numbers  are unique in the system registry. Â· System artefacts for the TrueCrypt Drives mapped registry may be recovered. System Registry, logs and other artefacts can be been found that demonstrate the existence  of other TrueCrypt partitions/drives in addition to those which have been admitted in most  instances. Â· Each TrueCrypt partition leaves a unique serial number in the registry of the system it is  mounted on. The âfingerprintsâ associated with the decrypted drives (those for which a  password has been supplied) do not match all the uncovered fingerprints when a hidden drive  exists.       http://digitalforensicstips.com/2014/05/some-basic-options-when-dealing-with-truecrypt-aka-f inally-a-forensics-post/          Locating TrueCrypt: One of the things that makes locating TrueCrypt files difficult is their lack of a standard  file signature that one would normally use to locate all of a particular file format. There  is a free tool called âTCHuntâ that will scan a drive or directory and look for files that  may be TrueCrypt containers. TCHunt looks for miles that meet specific size requirements  (file size divisible by 512 and at least a minimum size), doesnât have the file header of a  known common type and appears to contain a higher than average randomness of data which is a  key indicator that the contents may be encrypted.             or everything that TCHunt does itâs also amazingly quick. I ran it against a 750GB Hard  drive which had over 500GB of data and the complete scan took around three minutes. The tool  correctly identified all four TrueCrypt containers on the drive.Cracking TrueCrypt: Using Memory: Ideally you have a memory dump which was acquired while the TrueCrypt container was mounted.  In lieu of that the hiberfil.sys may have been written while the container was mounted.  TrueCrypt no longer stores itâs password in memory but it does store encryption keys in  memory while the container is mounted so the password doesnât need to be re-entered every  time a file is accessed. These keys can be located using tools like bulk extractor and are  the key to unlocking the container. Michael Hale Ligh wrote a great blog post on Volatility Labs earlier this year discussing  identifying and acquiring these keys. In the post he references a 2011 blog post by Michael  Weissbacher  where he outlines patching TrueCrypt to allow an examiner to use acquired AES  keys to mount a TrueCrypt container without knowing the password. There are commercial tools  such as passware and elcomsoft which will also allow an examiner to access a TrueCrypt  container using keys acquired from a memory dump. Without Memory: If no useable memory dump is available and you still want to access a locked TrueCrypt  container youâre hoping for quite a few things. â¢ The user used a short passwordâ¢ The user stuck to the default settings (RIPEMD-160 and AES) when creating the TrueCrypt  containerâ¢ You have access to a system with a powerful graphics card Modern graphics cards (GPUs) can crack passwords at a MUCH faster rate than a computer  processor (CPU) can. I recently upgraded to an ATI 7950 3GB model ($230 at Newegg) and Iâm  able to crack passwords on a TrueCrypt container created with default settings at a rate of  77,000 guesses per second. That sounds like a lot and itâs great for wordlists (I can go  through the entire 14,000,000 word rockyou list in under three minutes) but when you start  crunching the numbers on a brute forcing attempt youâll quickly become discouraged. If standard wordlists donât crack the password there could be multiple causes. The user  could have changed the default settings when creating the container or could have used a  password not in your word lists. You could try generating custom wordlists or using your  wordlists with different encryption options. I threw one of the TrueCrypt containers TCHunt found at oclHashcat to try to crack the  password. oclHashcat has multiple TrueCrypt encryption options but I tried the default  RipeMD160 and AES option first.=======================================================================    that post has screenshots in it as well.    i have a really scary pdf that has tons of pix in it all about cracking truecrypt          end me an email address or website where i can upload PDFs and i post it     tales-from-the-crypt-truecrypt-analysis.pdf",""

If you're really looking to make some cash then this is definitely for you. This is for exploiting 2 different Online casinos with 2 different methods. You will need to have UK based SOCKS proxies to make this work and there are resources inside of the guide for this. You may need a small amount of extra money to obtain these.

Your review is inaccurate and I feel you didn't even test it out. You invest 5 and you get 15 in return and the withdrawal gets processed usually within 1 hour. Also shows that you can do a 49% risk bet to double your money right away (roulette) which is completely optional. The gambling with roulette part to double your money is completely optional. Also the issue with the IP changing, I give you a solution in which you are able to sign up with 3 accounts per 1 IP address. I give you a resource in which you can obtain a lot of proxies for a very inexpensive price. He only read it but didn't apply it. The profit return is 10 in net profit... You don't get the same amount back. Please apply it and you will see with enough accounts that you will make a lot of profit if you're persistent with this. It's about exploiting the bonus by which you are credited immediately by playing 1 round of roulette by choosing black AND red which your only chances to lose are literally 1% and I have done a lot of these trades to get the bonuses and I haven't lost a single one. I've been doing this for a few days and have been able to make the money advertised with this. I wouldn't sell something that doesn't work, bro. Please implement and interpret it correctly. The gambling bit is completely optional.

It's the only way to claim the bonus and withdraw it. Also, you can flat out buy SOCKS proxies with vip72 that don't always change. You can also use any kind of open UK proxies that you find on the internet because this casino network doesn't openly scan for people using proxies.

"Evolution Forums","FoxTom","19399","2014-08-07T22:13:06","Re: ---------","Guides Vendors","OK, I first must say, the price for this guide is well balanced and I would recommend to Cardidavid to sell only limited copies of it.Those always interested in PayPal must know that cardie basically brings a new paypal guide every month or two. The guy has good experience in this fraud field. I'm in the process of doing the transfer to myself today and hopefully I will get a good transfer! THE REVIEWSometimes, in fraud life, to get good money, you need 1. to be on time and 2. to have good method. I'm saying this 'cause I'm sure this method will stop working in some weeks. So if you have right now $100 doing nothing on your wallet, expecting a good guide, buy this guide RIGHT NOW and don't wait 'till ""oh, another method I got late and is now burned"". You will need:$100 for the guideApprox $20 or $30 to buy some accounts on slipp and get the hands on some good fullz (no with cvv, only fullz ID).Is better if you have an aged business paypal account but you can make some ATO from slilpp accounts too, or even upgrade a Premier to Business with just some scans. You also need a good cashout method for paypal. I prefer to buy some good stuff to my drops, but if you have debit cards, is much better. Cardie also give some tips on how to get and use a debit card that is easily obtainable in the USA in a matter of days.If I were you, I would do this 5x times today, and tomorrow and past tomorrow with different accounts. The method is very easy and fast. You just need a PC and the right tools that are not hard to get on Evo.

"Evolution Forums","arcana","19399","2014-08-08T04:15:39","Re: ---------","Guides Vendors","Review : Fat Paypal Transfer with no Chargeback-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First of all, thanks to cardie for giving me the vouch copy. I'm not affiliated to cardie in any way, nor have I received any money / favor to write this review. That being said, this is going to be an honest review from my side.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WritingThe quality of a guide is discerned by the style how it's written, and also, how readable is it. In this very guide, cardie uses the good ol' Calibri font, which is definitely readable and soothing to the eyes. The guide is error free. The guide uses simple spoken English, so there's no high level vocab or stuff like that. Even the non-English speakers can fully understand it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MethodI have to agree, this is indeed a new and original method. Without disclosing anything, this method is pretty damn easy to accomplish, you just need to have a good set of tools as described in this guide. This method revolves around one website, which has pretty damn low security, and will get saturated once this guide finds its way to more readers. Now, regarding the simplicity of the method, it's pretty damn easy. I can assure you of this. You just need to have the right set of prerequisites, and you can have $3000 or more sitting in your PayPal account, in just under 10 minutes. No, I'm not drunk. 10 minutes. I've tested it myself. This guide, along with Yasuo's, will give you the maximum positive results. Regarding the saturation of this method. You can be damn sure newbies and the advanced carders will burn this method as soon as they get their hands (uh.. eyes?) on it. That's why I recommend cardie to increase the price from the original $100. But, it's the OP's decision on the price. Nothing I can do about that.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion cardie, who stands as a very respected member in the TCF community, has put together a fantastic method. This method is accompanied by his own experiences, and the guide provides tips if you get stuck with something. Although this method will get saturated soon, I highly recommend you buy this guide.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ratings Writing : âââââMethod :  For newbies : âââââFor advanced carders : âââââ Final rating : âââââ (Must buy)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------arcana.

The guide is kept brief and to the point and moreover it will work and is completely free. You have nothing to lose by doing this method and it can produce alot of potential drops just you may not be able to use the same one twice.  This method does require you to be in person but I reckon the risk is very low that anything can come back to bite you in the ass. For the easy to read layout and straightforward format I will give this method 7/10.  The idea is good and this can be used for people having a tough time getting drops for envelopes but not much more. The base of the method could inspire the reader to come up with other ways to use the barebones of the method in several different circumstances. I recommend this for people receiving confirmation letters, bank statements, credit cards, pins and other sensitive financial info that can be used to obtain credit.",""

Guide is small and written straight to the point , there is small mistakes which i corrected before writing this feedback.

This guide/method/tricks allows you to bypass it. Its pretty simple but it requires some work also , registrations and waiting. I think 600 euro a day is kinda too high aimed for this method for freshly made accounts  , but if you wanna earn like 1000 euro in a week , this method is definatly for you.Thing what anoys me is setting everything up.

Firstly I should comment about the way it was written. It came as a .txt file, which I am not a big fan of, as I prefer a professional PDF format, however I must not judge a book by its cover; that was certainly the case here. The guide is to the point, and although its short, it cover all necessary steps, and I did not encounter a step in process which was not as it was suppose to be in the guide.I personally do not play poker, I have a theoretical understanding but no experience, however this did not matter. The guide does not actually go into detail on how to play, just enough to actually preform the method. I personally have preformed a Poker/Gambling site cash-out before, and this method is something I have not done before. Is this guide for you? Well its not a simple guide, you do need to put some work into it, and not anything physical, but getting some of the requirements, which if you card you likely already have. However, a real estimate for this, could be $1000 a week if implemented right. I do vouch for this guide, and Nobodyy's services in general."

Firstly I should comment about the way it was written. It came as a .txt file, which I am not a big fan of, as I prefer a professional PDF format, however I must not judge a book by its cover; that was certainly the case here. The guide is to the point, and although its short, it cover all necessary steps, and I did not encounter a step in process which was not as it was suppose to be in the guide. I personally do not play poker, I have a theoretical understanding but no experience, however this did not matter. The guide does not actually go into detail on how to play, just enough to actually preform the method. I personally have preformed a Poker/Gambling site cash-out before, and this method is something I have not done before.  Is this guide for you?

The method described in here utilizes a way of sourcing data which is cheap and effective. It avoids the need to spend money on fulls or data sold by vendors which is of course a benefit but at the same time consuming. I guess it would be down to personal preference, however the benefit of using 'Walkers' method is that you can customize the data in which you reap - Location, Value of Mark etc. The guide is straight forward and simple to understand, the same with ordering from the mentioned sites in my experience You order low risk items = good results You order high risk items = bad results I guess another benefit of using 'Walkers' method to obtain data for accounts is his method on how to order high value items and avoid the security flags that anyone who has worked with these sites, will know about.

Getting to the writing, it's just one paragraph, with poor grammar and no punctuation, but, it's still readable and gives you a basic idea what the method is, and what you need to do. As for the method, it's a pretty easy one. Not revealing much, but you would have to spoof the caller ID of the CH. And you can card some BTC pretty easily. The verification is easy, and would not take much of your time. One thing I can assure you is that no scans would be required. All in all, this guide is not an original method, but the method works.

Matthew Verran Jones, who works for Data Paradigm Inc. in Dallas, has been charged with illegally distributing a controlled substance on Silk Road as well as outside the website. Federal authorities shut down Silk Road last year and charged its 29-year-old founder with building a drug empire that had an estimated $1.2 billion in sales. But before Silk Road was brought down, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Orlando bought painkillers, sedatives and other drugs from multiple sellers on the website. According to a recently unsealed criminal complaint filed in Orlando, Jones, 44, opened a Silk Road account in April 2013 and used the alias ""CALIGIRL."" Since then, CALIGIRL made 685 sales. The profile was among the top 5 percent of all Silk Road vendors, the complaint said. DEA agents said they made two undercover buys from CALIGIRL's Silk Road account and six other undercover purchases from CALIGIRL outside the website using an encrypted program, the complaint said. Authorities have bought or seized more than 1,300 oxycodone and hydrocodone pills from Jones, authorities said. Agents also learned Jones frequently traveled to Colombia, where he bought the oxycodone he later sold online. Jones was arrested Thursday in Broward County, where he remained jailed Friday. The case is the latest local DEA investigation into Silk Road. Last fall, Orlando federal prosecutors filed charges against Delaware physician Olivia Bolles, alleging she sold hundreds of prescription drugs illegally on Silk Road and shipped them to Central Florida. Agents found more than 600 sales between Bolles' ""MDPro"" account and Silk Road users, records filed in her case said. EVERYONE should read the affidavit filed by the task force agent.  Clearnet*  http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/May/20140530_Jones_Complaint.pdf Gives you good insight into the capabilities of LE right now. Shows how stupid Jones was with his opsec.

So that gives him the right to claim ownership and selling rights. A lot of it is old and saturated as well. And even though the cost is not that high, I'd argue still not value for money. If this is his selling method, then I doubt his support as well. He doesn't believe in vouches lol. No wonder he only recommends it to noobs, who will probably still buy anyway.

If you want to even get more secure just add the ""gpgâhidden-recipient"" command and you won't even be able to tell who the recipient of the message was. Well if they are able to get as far in as seeing who the buyer and seller are that information is irrelevant because it wouldn't take a genius to figure out who the message was from and to. As long as the buyer and seller have their secret keys secured I don't see how they will get any useful information assuming all personal and sensitive information is encrypted. I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem like that big of a deal as far as the dark net users go. Maybe if I was the owner of the site I might be a little more worried, but I'm not.

This method will saturate relatively quickly so the less people get it the better for all of us. This method is one of the simplest on the market, extremely noob friendly and has a potential of up to 2 BTC a day. Now this one of the best methods you can get at the moment if you don't like to bother with to many details and like simple, easy guides. Why buy this? -High profit potential (up to 2 BTC a day!)-Only CC and verified PayPal necessary-Simple to do-If you have CC and verified PP ready you will make your money back TODAY! No more waiting for several days or weeks till the first profits come in! No more having to get fullz! No more passport and utility bill scans! No more burner phones and number spoofing!   Now both guides available for 600$ or for 350$ each. Sorry for this rapid price increase but wait for Yasuo's detailed review and you'll see its worth it. Considering the potential this is still extremely cheap. I will only sell 10 copies to prevent too fast saturation so get it while you can and make your money back today!",""

"Evolution Forums","cratzvendor","43454","2015-01-16T03:07:51","VOUCHED - Cash Out ANY Bank Account & Make Killing w/ ACH Transfers","Guides Vendors","This guide is currently priced at $500. HOWEVER, the price will be increasing on the following schedule: On Sunday January 18th, 2015 - or in 48 hours, the price of this guide will increase to $1,000. On Tuesday January 20th, 2015 the price of this guide will increase to $1,500. On Thursday January 22nd, 2015 the price of this guide will increase to $2,000.On Saturday January 24th, 2015 the price of this guide will increase to $3,000.On Monday January 26th, 2015 the price of this guide will increase to $4,000. On Wednesday January 28th, 2015 the price of this guide will increase to $5,000.  On Friday January 30th, 2015, this guide will no longer be sold - unless I hit 30 sales before this point.  This method will teach you exactly how to make as much money as you want by cashing out bank accounts. This method has been vouched by BigMeesh, JabbaJabba, Bongos, Jim, and MountainHigh9. Their reviews are here: Update: I've gotten over 43 PM's from people asking for a discount/deal from my $500 asking price.  Some have even threatened me to lower my price or else. I am publicly announcing that I will not lower my price. I will be increasing the price based on the above schedule. This method is currently making me money. Not only that, this method  HAS already made a well respected member of this forum several thousands of dollars in the last week. The reviews are below. Take the time to read them, then decide on whether or not you'd like to team up with me.   Here's What You'll Get - You'll get 15 pages of step by step instructions that will show you how I have made over $40,000 in the last 3 weeks. - You'll get hand holding from me from start to finish until you make your first $2,500 cash out.  Why Am I Selling This - Firstly, I'm in this to make money. If you buy, I'll make money. - Secondly, I want to help those who want help. If you need to make money and you're not sure about how, get this guide and we'll do it together.  Why Are You Only Selling 30 Copies? There are two reasons for this: 1) I do not want this method to get burned out. 30 guides will keep the number of people who know about this method to a minimum.2) I don't want to be stretched too thin. By working with 30 people, I can help everyone cashout without burning myself out. Does This Method Work Only In The USA? Since I live in the USA, that's the only place I've tried it. However, I can guarantee that Method #3 will work even if you're in another country.   A Little About Me I'm a loving father and a caring husband. Since my first child was born, I've been unable to adequately care for my family. No matter how many jobs I've tried to work, no matter how many hours I worked, no matter what I did, I was never able to make ends meet.  We were always late on our rent. Our phone service was always being disconnected. Our utilities were always past due and being disconnected because we didn't have the money to pay the minimum amount due.  When we went to the gas station, we could never fill the gas tank all the way. So we put in $5 - $10 at a time because that was all we could afford. Life fucking sucked. How in the world can I call myself a man if I can't even provide for my own family? I was a disgrace... If there is anyone who has been through one of these things â I know you can relate.  It was an article on Yahoo that introduced me to this world. It was desperation that brought me to this world. It was a simple desire of wanting to be a provider â that drove me into this life. When I got here, I was dumbfounded by all the opportunities. Seriously! Where else can you buy credit card with pins? (I should note that when my first order didn't come â I found out that everything wasn't as it seemed).  After more digging around, I found this great community. Although there are a lot of good people here, there are many more trying to âpull one overâ on as many people as they can. I've been scammed by people who I thought were legitimate sellers. I've wasted precious money on guides that simply didn't work. Almost $2,000 borrowed dollars later, I was in the same position I was when I started.  I even sent emails to Vendors asking them to buy their guides at a discount. Talk about desperate. No wonder they didn't reply.  This is when I decided to not buy anything else until I knew for sure what the hell I was doing. I decided to focus on one thing and one thing only â bank accounts. I needed to learn any and everything I could about them. Since I bank at WF, I called them up and started asking questions about my account security. What if this happened? What if that happened? What makes you the best in this case?  I spent dozens of hours with a pen and paper writing out diagrams of different ways I can legally send someone money from my bank account. During these times, I slept maybe 3 hours per night. But I was determined to figure it out. I was determined to crack a code that I would be able to utilize for my benefit over and over again. Then it hit me... I figured out 5 strategies I could use that would possibly work. I tried all 5 methods with small amounts of money and 3 of them worked - $1,500 in profit made. I tried the 3 previous ones that worked, again with small amounts - $1,950 in profit made. My hard work paid off and the rest, as they say - is history.  Some of you may not believe anything I'm saying. To be honest? I don't care. Some of you can relate with what I'm saying and know I'm telling the truth. Have faith and let's do this together.  Who Is This For? -This guide is for those who are tired of struggling with methods that either don't work or make little amounts of money.  -If you're in charge of providing for your family, and that's you're reason for being on the dark web â then this guide is for you.  -If you only want to do this temporarily to make a certain amount of money before going âlegitâ, then this guide is for you.  Conclusion It's easy to forget that we're all actual people. We are all human beings. With all the anonymity going on, it's easy to just recognize each other as a screen name. However, all of us have a story. All of us are here for a reason. All of us are driven by something â whether big or small. This âsomethingâ makes us unique individuals.  If you are tired of the bullshit and you are ready to make money at last - get this guide. We'll work together until you cash out your first account and make your first $2,500.  If you've got everything under control and aren't interested in diversifying your income â then don't buy this guide.  My plan at this moment is to make $100,000. After I make this, I'll be able to move forward and fund my legitimate businesses. My family will also be debt free. Selling this guide will put me another step closer to that goal.  Good luck with your future - hopefully we get to work together. http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/78324 UPDATE: MH9 was able to use my methods 5 times in a row and cash out ALL 5 TIMES! That shows you that THIS METHOD WORKS. I've been getting a lot of questions about whether I'll work on a percentage basis with people. Here is the answer to that question - Yes. BUT, I will only work on a percentage if the amount in the checking account is over $30,000. Based on some feedback, I'm willing to put money into escrow so that everyone is protected throughout. The percentage will be 70/30 with 70 percent going to me. I'm sorry, but this percentage is non negotiable. You'd make money while I went out and took 100% of all the risk cashing out.

While the first two methods may not be brand new to some of the more experienced fraudsters on here, there are quite a few minute details that seal the deal for success that I've yet to see anywhere. These first to are incredibly simple and require at most 8 hours of work, which is more than acceptable for a 2k+ cashout.As for the third method: this is something pretty ingenious if I'm forward. There is quite a bit more work than the first two methods, and it also takes a bit longer to pull off, but the cashouts could easily be tenfold the other methods. As with the first two methods, this third, more intense method is explained in great detail that I'm sure nearly anyone with a decent level of intelligence could follow. Is it difficult? No. Does it take some time? Yes. However ALL methods can be pulled off for a clean cashout in a week or less.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new avenue with bank cashouts who doesn't mind some legwork. You won't be disappointed.;jabbajabba wrote:I had the privilege of receiving this guide to review. I will probably give another review when I test them out especially the first two methods which are not as difficult in terms of setting up as the the third one. The first two methods are sort of laughably easy. I almost didn't believe it. You are looking at 2-3k in 2-3 days wait time and a few hours actually working for it. Seasoned fraudsters might know about this method but I guess they aren't speaking about it because it's too good of a method to sell or giveaway. Maybe cratz shouldn't either.The third cash out method can definitely work, it has a better payday than the first two methods. I know of a method that is simpler in its approach and can have the same results of 10k+ in one day of cashing out after setup time. All methods require you to get from behind the comp screen and do a little to moderate SE and legwork. Not for those who are frightened by cameras, take opsec lightly, or afraid of risk. This looks strictly US based, it might be possible the first two methods can be tailored to outside countries."

Are you as me very hungry? Do you want to stop wasting money on useless guides that promises you alot but gives you nada? Well let me help you here: Buy this fucking guide before the price as well before it get sold out, im 100% sure it either will get sold quick after couple of reviews.  Im very very happy man atm. Cant sleep after have read it, cant believe its so easy to do. But again yes i believe its that easy for cratz has written every step you need and as i can see it (Be aware im newbie and this is first time im doing this as well reading it) its should hold as long as there is WU office or other money transfer. The only thing i think (Again as newbie) their can do is asking more questions but that should not be a problem if you follow this guide. The guide its self is very easy to understand and i think every body can do it.I will try it out in couple of days and will turn back.

I generally do not like spending a lot of time on Jabber. However, I'm hoping to set up some sort of system so I can help anyone who needs it.  Nico111 - check your PM.",""

So Far, I have $40k across 10 accounts for myself. I know I've talked to some of you about this already. If you would like to get in on it, get your WF accounts together with the necessary information. When I'm ready, you will send it to me and I'll cash it out for you. I'll keep a small percentage and will send the rest back to you in a way we both agree on.  If you'd like to participate, just work on getting your accounts together. I'm going live with this next cashout by next Monday.",""

Guard nodes exist for a reason. The more difficult it is for a node to get guard status, the less chance there is of an evil actor controlling both an entry point and an exit. I guess if one is really worried, then just set a strict exit policy (ie to a well established one exit node) - but again, this has been recommended against. (Edited - additional thought  )

Wifite will automatically set your wireless card or wireless usb adapter into monitor mode, scan the air for all channelks and list them. it will show you what encryption they all use and if they have WPS enabled (which Reaver attacks). You then then type in what ones you want to automatically hack, or you can select 'ALL', it will start and go through all known cracking methods automatically, to packet injection for WEP, disassociation and recapturing WPA/2 handshakes (to be cracked later with another program), to WPS PIN bruteforcing (it actually uses a Reaver Transparently in the backround). So it is a cool tool for a lazy man with some time up his sleeve, you can set it going for a few hours for all wifi networks and come back to some results. Fern wifi cracker is also one of these 'one stop shop' type of applications, however it is GUI based and I find really clunky and often does not work, so either stick to hacking networks manually, or use wifite. To the OP, you are shit out of luck trying to use Windows. Unless you buy special wireless cards and software for windows which can cost hundreds or thousands which support packet injection, then you can't hack. You need to install a virtual machine like Virtualbox, and install Kali Linux inside of it (it has all the tools built in). You can then just buy most USB adapters these days, Netgears always seem to work and are cheap (just do some research before you buy one to ensure it supports packet injection, because sometimes you won't realise why a hack is not working when it should) To the guy who said Reaver is shit, no its not. Reaver is good. I wish it was finer tuned but it is a great attack. WPS is the best method to hack a wireless network at the moment in my opinion. It can take anywhere from 1 - 14 hours but you are guaranteed to crack it if it is supported. Unlike where you capture WPA2 handshake, and use rainbow tables and big dictionaries which just don't work, because vendors are increasingly shipping WAPS with longer and longer random strings for pass-phrases which unless youve got a GPU cluster and terrabytes of rainbow tables you aren't going to crack.

The program wifite is a Python script and you can run it on any Linux machine, and its wifite that automates all of this. Kali is a distro for penetration testing or hacking, its an updated version of Backtrack. So I recommend it because there are also other wifi cracking tools installed, and they ensure all the drivers will work out of the box. And again, Reaver is FAR from shit... it is the best way to crack wireless networks these days. If you need to crack something fast, it is not for you. But if you are in an area with quite a few networks (at your work place, your neighbors) and WPS is enabled on any of the networks, you are in. ((if you do use WPS attacks, sometimes they dont work, its not Reaver's fault, it's because those devices aren't vulnerable to bruteforcing))",""

First of all, i can only assume this method is going good and strong ?. i can assume i can make a good profit of this ?. What are the required ''equipments'' i would need to buy to do this successfully, obviously a vpn, some proxies and random pizza's from here i assume, would i also need a burner phone and burner sim ?.

"Evolution Forums","yummy5656","10126","2014-05-15T11:34:45","[Vouched] Yummy's CC to BTC Method [Temporary Closed]","Guides Vendors","Hello friends, For a while, i was working on a simple method which allows to buy bitcoin with CC. Finally i finished my tryings, have enough experiences on my method  and write this guide. Actually it's not a ""method"". it's only a website from which you can easily buy bitcoin and litecoin with CC's. it's simple even for newbies.  - What is the progress?  1- You will go to my source.2- Pay with your CC.3- You will redirect to main page and fill a simple form. (your wallet address, e-mail, name etc.)4- They will e-mail to you and you confirm your amount and payment. (re e-mail to them)5- They will send your bitcoin within same day.6- That's all TL:DR. ------  - Which security settings need for this?  Basic security is enough. VPN / Socks / Ccleaner after/before each transaction / timezone settings etc.  ------  - How much can i earn per CC?  i never tried for huge amounts. i've 2 reason for this. One of them is surely avoiding website's flags and method's health. For first transactions making a $500 order is weird. Don't be greedy and don't do this. And the second reason is, they wrote in their privacy policy > ""we may ask id verification scans, phone calls etc. for big transactions.  i always try amounts $50-$100 range and all of them was success. ------------------------------------- PROS OF MY METHOD: [+] My source does not want to any registration progress before payment. You can go and pay without register. Most of BTC exchange sites want tons of document while registering or purchasing.[+] They sent bitcoin within SAME DAY. Even within hours if you catch them on working hours.[+] They didn't want any verification document or phone call for liitle amounts from me.[+] Their payment processor is weak i think. i tried with an NON-AVS amex and even it worked for me. They accept Visa/Mastercard/Amex/discover and prepaid card.[+] Website's owners not proffessional and really want to help their customers. So, their support system is good.[+] i usually online on evo forums and market within day. i can give full support to my customers. ------------------- CONS: [-] This is not exactly con but i must to say. Website's language isn't english 100%. And owners can e-mail you with a different language. But the good thing is, i know that language and could give a full support if they ask you something or any other situation. ------------------ I wrote a very detailed guide (5 pages of *pdf) with some pictures and examples for you all. So, a newbie and experienced carders could learn everything from mu guide. Even so, you can ask me anything. i try to help as possible as i do. -------------------------- Price is 0.25 BTC and the quota is 3 for now. Best regards, yummy5656.

It's simply too easy to be wooed by potential positives. Unfortunately with any guide or method you should be in the habit of finding flaw, or incorrect information. Once this has been completed you should move on to a full beginning to end trial, and expect positive ( and completed ) results. Multiple trials is obviously best to show a win/lose ratio if necessary. Vouching for a method you have not actually completed ( despite where the fault lies - which is no excuse ) is very unpro. Let's skip the buddy buddy stuff guys, and stick to brass tacks, please. These are just a very few basic things that should be undertaken for reviews, and even moreso vouches. I would expect you to receive a much higher level of paying customers as well OP.  Edit: Not trying to attack you moka, and I don't doubt yummy's method, but your vouch/review ( while pretty ) is fairly meaningless hype without a completed successful trial, bro. You know better =P

Actually, i think i don't need anyone's vouch for my sales at this moment. And this is same for moka. He has lots of successful sales and don't need anybody's vouch. But i still give a copy to my 2 friend because people always cares more ""other's opinion"" A vouch means , an experienced member of this forum comes and write that, - yes! that method is not copy paste or other old shit- yes, it's the same as advertised. no trimmings, no sales tactic. You missed that no one like me don't want to fuck his reputation for a few hundred bucks! And you also missed that, i NEVER sale any method or service which i didn't try before. And no one like moka don't want to hurt his reputation for a fucking single review! Please don't forget this on future postings. i tried this several times and make a profit about $650 and increasing. i write incredible easy guide for this and even so giving full support for communication with source. So, that's all what i want to say. Method's success not only about vendors. it's also about buyer's ability. For example imagine if you marketing the most beatiful, most profitable, most easy, most excellent paypal method and some idiot bought it from you and tried with tor browser and write ""yeah don't work man"" You can't do anything about this type of guys. That's why we give free copies to experienced members. So, don't try to teach me ""what must be the vouch strategy"" or don't talk with allusions like ""vouchers must wait since success blah blah."" i'm not stupid as open a sale with 0.5 btc price which i didn't give a try before on this community.

I'm sorry you felt the need to come out swinging defending absolutely nothing as you say. Reviewing a product without fully testing it means absolutely nothing. Once again I'm not damning your method or calling it, I'm speaking plainly. If you fail to see this then I feel for you, it's nothing more than delusion. I see a lot of things moka works on, and do not question his ability or character one bit. Not sure where you pulled that from. Nothing I've said is untrue. As for registration dates and post counts, I can understand how someone like yourself would put a lot of faith in these. It only shows you haven't been around the fraud world for very long my guy. I change usernames every couple months on every community, and don't concern myself with posting unless it serves a purpose on some level or someone is engaging me in conversation. Registration dates and post counts are usually things brought up by people who hide behind them. If you know what you're doing in your own field(s) the truth will be told pretty quickly in a conversation. It's why I never have issue on new accounts/low posts etc. I come correct, and don't speak on things I lack an understanding of  Best of luck on sales, don't wanna turn this into spam fest   Edit: Ok maybe I post some random shit on occassion, anyway you get my point, haha.

I just didn't like your some allusions and words. That's why i reply to your post with a bit angry mode. Anyway, i don't agree some of your claims and agree some.  ""Reviewing a product without fully testing it means absolutely nothing"" Again, i don't agree with this in generally. Not only for my this sale. Read again my paypal example on my last post. An another example for a amazon refunding guide. Let's think some guy write a detailed guide about amazon refunds and some noob buoght it. But he did a excitable talk with amazon support, they suspect from thay guy and don't make a refund or replacement. it does not seems that the amazon method was not working. it's just buyer's incompetence. So, ""Reviewing a product without fully testing it DOES NOT means absolutely nothing"" as you said. A review points to others that, - method's legitimate.- method's orginality.- What vendor advertise and what's there in his guide? - is the guide same as advertised or not. That points are important. People had an idea because of this reviews.---------------------- some vendors like trimmings in their guides. They say ""that's easy for everyone"" but after bought we see, it is not easy for everyone. or they advertise, ""just go to ATM and have a fun with your profit"" but people when go to atm, they learn that it needed some of other pins or docs etc. so it's not my business way.------------------------i advertise a source which allows you buy BTC or LTC directly with cc's. i know it's really hard to find this kind of site's nowadays. and i advertised payment processor is weak and there is no need extra documents, scans for verifying for liitle amounts per cc. Moka's reviews shows to people that i really selling a guide exactly same as i advertised. You just missed that. Of course we will see the results. Maybe that kind of methods can saturate quickly but the main point is i never try to sell any shit, with some sales tactics or different than i promised.  Changing your nicknames in several monts is your own way and this is my own.-------------- i just agree with you, post counts is not very important factor for learning vendor's quality or for trusting them. You're right. But even so, a combination of post count, post content and feedbacks gives a bit idea to people for that vendor. And yes, new vendors could has great services and we can't judge them for their registration dates or posts. Thanks for your wishes. Oh, writing about polemics is really boring for me because of my english.------------------i just want to answer your focused points. Have a nice day.

The support from the site and the seller of this guide is amazing. Once you purchase this guide the OP will help you translate what ever email is sent to you. I would of received my coins yesterday but there was a problem with my email address. I got my coins just a second ago. I bought $90 worth and after they took out their percentage I ended up with $78. And now I will try again tomorrow for a higher amount. Coins would have been delivered earlier but because of maintenance work it took a while. Bitcoins delivered on a Sunday??? yes that's right. No scans no verification, only communicate through email .  The only con in this is the language is not English, but as I said the OP gives full support in translating it.  This site is incredibly low in security and have good customer care. Low amounts is good. I personally would like to try a high amount with scans and see how it works out. 4/5 Overall rating I vouch for this method.  ~Meesh",""

I'm glad to business with you. Bigmeesh was my first customer for this method and also i think he was the first person who tried my method except me. So, i have earn some new experiences while we talking with Bigmeesh for this process. Today i will make some additions/edits on my guide for making it more easy. And we'll ready to go for monday. First of all, i must to repeat, my source website's owners really amateur with bitcoin work and webmastering. It provides lots of advantages for us.If they were a huge company or professional people, as you can guess, they would not be selling bitcoins for CC without any verification process IMHO, they only want to spread their service for more people. That's why they have amazing support and very helpful. Their commission rate is good. Even so, good for compared to bigger sites like btc-e or some greedy exchange sites. As i said before,  - My source is extremely easy to card. - The only thing you have to do is  * Create a fake e-mail * find a good balanced CC, * use right socks, timezone* make your payment and * fill a simple form. (i will asist how to fill it) That's all. - After that, i will asist you rest of the process. They will e-mail to you something for verify your payment in another language. You will copy-paste that e-mail and i will write an answer instead of you.  - You will copy-paste my email and sent them on working days (oh they're working even on sunday ) and they will sent your bitcoin directly to your wallet. i think it's very easy for everyone. Your only responsibility is to find a CC and make a simple payment. I only can't support about this. There are tons of sources in deep-web and evolution market for finding good CC's. Most cards could work with this. Because their security is weak. Also, our strategy is simple too. For the first purchase, we will not exceed $70-80. After than, if your card is good and have some balance, you can try higher amounts.  And the goal is, you can repeat each step with another names and cards. You can make huge profit before this saturated. If a have a good ID scans for that area, i can try huge amounts per card. Oh meanwhile, i really miss ISP. Now, business time friends. You must hurry up. First come first serve! Soon i am starting to make some small changes and additions on my guide. And it will be ready and more easy for this week!

It's the nature of credit cards. When the chargeback rates more than usual orders, they probably add new security measures. But i can pass their some security measures  i regularly check the source, do not worry. That's why my sale quantity is limited. Now, this is still working like a charm. And please focus that, my support is more important than my *guide for this method.  Communicate with site owners, choose the right/common words while e-mailing is important. i still giving full support to my customers. Moka thank you again friend. Glad to see your comment. i can give support to my customers about, - phone number format for that site- addresses- name surname info- zip code etc. Even, i will look for some burner sim cards for them. if i success, you can purchase for more amounts and i can call them instead of you. The only problem is, i talked with them a few times and i'm in suspicious about my voice. Help me moka  any software or way for voice change is apcepted. So, that's all. As you see, i do everything for making this easy method > more easy for you. Your only responsibility is finding a CC. i can redirect my customers for the rest of the progress.",""

"Evolution Forums","yummy5656","10126","2014-05-22T06:25:16","Re: [Vouched] Yummy's CC to BTC Method [Temporary Closed]","Guides Vendors","i think you guys trying CC's too much and so aggressive  Payeer is not additional security measure. it's only a payment gateway for purchasing your orders. This may brings to us some advantages and disadvantages. First of all, payeer accept many of payments methods for depositing an account which including - Directly Visa / Mastercard payments- Western Union- Wire transfers- Liqpay- Checks etc.  Go there for a quick checkout > https://payeer.com/en/add/ And there are lots of website which allows to exchange/convert your other funds to one of them. For example we can find an exchange site for converting paypal to X OR we can adding to money to our Western Union account if we can have a FULLZ with right BINS. Now, possibilities are more for payments. And i think you have no limitation with some special COUNTRIES/areas for payments. But now, our CON is these payeers guys are not amateur people like my source site's guys and they may ask for some other documents for verify payments. Especially , payments which made via DIRECTLY VISA/MASTERCARD. Notice please, you still can made your payments via other ways that payeer accepted! In the other hand, my source guys still unaware of the security. They still don't ask for any registration process or documents. Their only wish is, customers made payments and communicate with them and they will send BTC's. Even so, if they ask for phone call, i'm working hard to find burner sim cards and making phone calls instead of you. This is not hard for me. Even, i can do this at this moment too. But i must find more sim cards for next week. i e-mailed them and they say,  ""we are still trying to find best payment system for purchases and avoiding TAXES for both, you and us"" So, i'm sure that they will change again this on next week or later. They still think, ""only problem is tax rates"" They don't wonder about fake purchases or their security. In this time, i will make a research about passing payeer system easily and notify you again. i think, WU/w fullz should be the best solution for us. Or some fake checks or wire transfers and bank accounts. can't guess now, i need a few days for checking this. Also i'll make trying with my cards ans some ID's for payeer.---------------TL:DRNow,- We still have a source and their owners still don't care about security and don't ask for registration/ scanned documents / phone calls before purchasing bitcoin/litecoin. They still make tryings with their new site and change their interface / groundwork. So, even at this moment while i writing this post they may change their system again. - The only thing we have to do is make our payments via payeer for NOW.- Payeer has lots of ways for depositing funds and we must find the easiest way for this.- After the orders placed, i can made phone calls or provide some additional documents for wining trust with my site (for huge orders). So, you still only responsible for making payments. Rest of the progress is mine work.- Now, you have no limitation for finding CC's from special locations or acting like a people from special area. Payeer is global shit. i can asist you how to talk and communicate with my guys if you use a name for payment from worldwide! Will updated on next week when i complete my tryings and workings and conversating with the source site owners. Regards.

Of course i'm researching google and other my sources for funding with OKPAY. Their security measures and privacy policy seems good but not to impossible to bypass with burners and fullz. Regards.

Exactly said this  Now,  - You just need an amazon account and some funds in it. - i think, at this moment any refund services may be useful for both you and me. i'll also know a few amazon e-gift card voucher. in each cases it'll be more easy compared to payeer / okpay.  And i so tired of editing/updating my guide when they changed payment option. Website's interface same and so easy but i still have to change my guide each time when they update payment processor.i'm tired this. After this, i will sent my guide as text on my Evolution vendor panel and surely still will give FULLY support to all customers. i can provide you some phone calls (instead of you) and could give any other tricks for better success rate. They sent your coins via 2 hours on working hours.  For lastly, because of bitcoin price is up, my new price is 0.4 btc Sales going on! Quota is 3 for now.

As i guess, they want to bigger on international market. Now, [+] Added ""pay with PAYPAL"" option.* You can pay with paypal as directly sent your money to an account and could be give your BTC within 3 hours on working hours/days. [+] Pay with CC option is more easy now. You just need good cards for depositing your account on an international source.[+] Ukash / Cashu Option.* Any of code works. I can give some good sources/exchange websites which i still using for converting your other virtual items to ukash/cashu.----------------------------Today, price is still 0.4 BTC. Tomorrow, i'll increase it again 0.5 btc.-------------------------- Honestly, i don't want any kind of saturation specially about PAYPAL.So, - Newbies, who don't know anything about ""strong"" middleman accounts or don't know about transfering/cleaning his money from hacked to his middleman etc. DON'T BUY THIS. I will send my way, as an text message for my each customer via EVO MARKET, and make them step-by-step instructions. I want to business experienced people only after this time for this method. I don't sell it via a *pdf file. Because my support and instructions are important. If anyone buy and use fucking slilpp account for this, they may remove ""PAYPAL"" from their payment options because of possible DISPUTES. I don't want to this. That's why price is 0.5 again. Maybe worth more but 0.5 is fair i think. ------------------------ - I still can give fully support. My support includes , - Communicute with my source (even phone callings if necessary)- Providing some FULLZ (Personal info and scans only) if necessary- Tips and tricks about converting dirty funds.- Tips for bypassing Paypal auto-security system.- Talking about any kind of other your questions---------------------------- [+] BUYERS RESPONSIBILITY  - FÄ±nd good CC's.- FÄ±nd stealth Paypal's.- Find any way about making some ukash/cashu. i still can help about these but i can't do anything if you use a hacked paypal which last login date is yesterday for example. ---------------------------- I can only vouch Moka, and Yasuo for good NON-VBV CC's at this time. If it comes to talk about ""vendors"" on here, i've learn from my experiences that  ""Support and continuity"" more important than selling ""item/guide's quality""So, that's the 2 vendors i can vouch. ------------------ TL:DR * My guys still continue their work.* Now, they want to be international BTC provider. So, it's excellent for us. They sometimes sell for AGC sometimes Paypal, sometimes OKPAY but they're not saturated.* Price will be 0.5 BTC for this week. I explained why above.* Newbies (about paypal and using CC's) get away. I explained why above too.* My full support is going on.* I will send this not as a *pdf guide.

Just changed their payment options from another one to another. It's good for all of us. They're still insistent for selling BTC with several types of payments.-------------------For example, in last week they've added directly PAYPAL payments to their paypal account and i can hit up $850. But NOW, i see that, they remove directly paypal option. It may because of my old customers / or others WRONG tryings with weak middleman paypal accounts (because of disputes) or PAYPAL's policy about bitcoin selling.As you know paypal don't allow any kind of crypto money selling like BTC/LTC etc.-------------------- Overall, i must honestly share some of my experiences as PROS/CONS about this. PROS > [+] It seems they will never saturate. They're still selling BTC nevertheless lots of fraud attempt and chargeback.[+] My source is really quick for sending your BTC. They usually sent it 30 minutes- 2 hours delay on working days/hours.[+] Their communication is still great and very fast. When you e-mail them something in their language they quickly replied on working hours. I think they're more safe than fucking Virwox. They never scam your money with excuses like ""suspect of fraud"" or they never banned you from sales without any excuse.[+] I've talked them with phone several times with my burners. So i've good SE skills with them. And i can help all of my customers if they need SE. This is so important for making easy your job! CONS > [+] They change their payment types after some fraud attempts and it may be bad for some of my customers. For example about 1 months ago, they decide to sell BTC with AMAZON GIFT CARDS and remove it after 2 weeks. 2 of my old customers could pick-up some money with AGC's and then they suprised for this. For example, i can hit up easy $850 within 3 days with PAYPAL and now, i'm sad because of paypal removed  But i can't guess anything. Maybe they again will add directly paypal option to their another paypal account. I can't say anything at this moment. [+] Website owner's language is not ENGLISH. But just NOTIFY, i can give fully support for communicate with them if you need SE or talking or translating website's phrases. [+] They're amateur on webmastering and while they changing their website's interface/payment options, they may offline about 3-4 hours for maintenance. It's not a really con it's usual thing but i must to say this anyway. ------------------------------ Overall, i earned about $6k on 2 months and still going on. It's a long-life source as i said before. Now, they're accepting  * CC payments (via an international 3rd party website)* Moneygram* PerfectMoney* Cashu* Webmoney* Okpay* Egopay* LTC--------------CC payment source familiar for me and they also accept paypal (you need fake ID's)-------------- You can deposit and pay for BTC, whatever you want. You can use it for fraud or converting your virtual moneys.---------------- Because of ""directly paypal"" option removed at this moment, price again dropped to 0.4 btc /QUOTA > 2 and sales going on. You can ask questions via PM on Evo market. I'll give good support and step-by-step instructions to my all customers as always. I wish good weekend for all. Regards.

(GUIDE)","Guides Vendors","I'm back on Evo and I'm going to quit selling my previous guides regarding carding and hacking, but I'm going to focus on what I do IRL: internet marketing. I'll be selling guides which are tested, verified and improved by me and time by time I'll be going to write my own guides.  With this guide, you'll be able to make at least $100 a day with a little effort on Twitter. NO FURTHER INVESTMENT IS NEEDED! This is a very detailed and in depth guide with links to necessary tools, pictures and one full example. As mentioned, this guide is very easy and noobfriendly. It's been tested by me and I can guarantee it works, I also help my clients the first day with getting started if needed. The cost of this guide is $25, but you will get that back within a day or two depending on your effort!! PRICE NOW $25!!!  Because this is 100% marketing and using your brains, this method has no saturation or whatever and it can guarantee you an income for a long time if you do it right. There are NO LIMITS! The only requirements are some brains, email account and paypal account to receive the funds, and within 5min you will be earning dollars!                                                                                  http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion/listing/20319

Lol you send it to a member who is brand new with 20 posts. I'm a firm believer in registration dates and post count meaning jack shit. Some people kill accounts and start new ones regularly for their opsec, some people don't post a lot but know their shit. When it comes to something like this though, nobody is going to take that vouch seriously bro lol. Edit: Hit up Yasuo and see if he wouldn't mind reviewing it. Even though you havent been here long I'm sure you know how far his review goes. Also unlike your ""friend"" there, Yasuo doesn't review things he hasn't actually tried/tested which your friend seems to freely admit he has not.

Do them through a third party site (like travelocity, Obtiz) or a travel agency. Make sure you have a good fake id and enjoy the flight  p.s: Only buy one-way tickets and not round-trip. Also, card it about a day before the flight.",""

You created your account just to tarnish the image of a fellow vendor because you probably don't make any sales. I am here because a paying customer brought this to my attention, if not I have no time for a lowlife like you.  Be aware that I've been vending on the entire darknet before you even knew what Silk Road 1.0 is. I vended on 1.0, BMR (before you registered your BMR account), on Pandora and now on EVO.  I have nothing against you, but you're making a big mistake thinking that tarnishing my image will get you more sales. Microsoft and Apple co-exist, Walmart and Target co-exist; but you having a small brain does not know that business is all about competition.  From the way you bitch, moan & sound you're either African, Middle Eastern or totally uneducated and I don't blame you for your arrogance. Get you act together! If you think you offer something better...go for your customers. You said I ""card tickets"" and put peoples life in danger, and then claim you use different ""methods"". Don't you think your customers deserve to know more about the ""methods"" you claim you use??? ""Methods"" my ass...lol...How many airlines do you own? lol... How low can you go for peanuts? The darknet seems like your major source of income? You asked the admins to remove my listings, it's like telling the admins that 'x' vendor cuts his cocaine with salt (which is dangerous) and you don't cuts yours at all...can you prove you don't cut yours?  You also claim you are a reputable vendor (like you said), reputable vendors don't complain about competition and does not ask admins to remove competing listings. Instead, they use their time to search for ways to better their services and make more money.  Where is your ""livinglarge"" account on Evolution? Banned, disabled! Sound familiar! The darknet is all about elite, the moment you start realizing that and caring more about customer service instead of bitching about your competitors, you'll start putting more money in your pocket.  Watch out for a new market, where your ""livinglarge"" account will be banned as soon as it is created. Get off the darknet! You're not needed here, unless under a different name, which I assume you'll create to enable you reply to this thread. Good day livinglarge!

Someone said to keep an open mind in this market and to not discriminate on anything that could be offered.  First of all, even though we are a black market, we should STILL have boundaries. There is a fine line that separates what's ethical, not ethical and down right WRONG.  For instance, Selling drugs - This is a gray area, but I don't think it's unethical (My opinion)Stealing from others (Carding, Identity Fraud ETC) - This is definitely unethical, but no one gets physically hurt, abused or killed - So fuck it. Now, Child Porn, Hitman, Death and Gore Videos ETC are just down right WRONG and should DEFINITELY be banned. It's one thing to be open mind, and another to be blind to the fact that there are some things that should definitely be forbidden.

First of all he is offering services no different than any other vendor here or any other forums.  Proof:So if your service doesn't involve credit card fraud then why are you having several orders that are showing as refunded? simple answer to this is because it was canceled and everyone who knows this game will tell you this. If your method didn't involve credit card fraud then you would have 100% success on bookings correct?  ""30/05/14: Full on flight bookings for now, hotels are still available."" Of course you are full on flights because that is what cancels the most and anyone who works with flights can confirm this. Even my hotel bookings are 100% but my flights remain at around 95%.  Yes you can book 4 months in advance as I can too which makes you no different from any other travel vendor. All the travel vendors know the fact and confirm that once you check in to the hotel it can never get canceled. ""Q: Does your services include credit card fraud?A: No, I do not use methods that could put anyone in danger. Credit card methods died several years ago, I can book 4 months in advance. A booking made with a credit card would only last a few hours.""  LOLLLLLLL absolute fucking bullshit because i do this all the time and i have no problems booking upto 1 month in advance, so there you have it. ""A: 45% of the retail price on flights (i.e trip cost: $1000 - My price: $450) and 35% of the retail price on hotel (i.e trip cost: $1000 - My price: $350) "" Well this ones obvious for anyone who works with flights and hotels. Of course you will charge 45% for flights because it is more difficult and gets canceled often compared to hotels which is much easier to do. ANY BIG/EXPERIENCED TRAVEL VENDOR CAN CONFIRM THIS this livinglarge user will obviously try to do anything to defend himself to keep his prices at 45% for flights and 35% for hotels. fuck i would do the same exact thing if i could but im not a liar.

I've bought 2 guides on cashing out pp and carding and none of them mention anything about changing your OS or setting up Whonix or even doing everything from public wifi, or anything that focuses on your security, is it that everyone has their own methods or some people just don't care about security that much?

You will only get an unbiased review from me. Doesn't mean that a free copy was provided, I will sugarcoat his guide. Nope. At least not in my reviews.METHOD = âââââAlright. Since there are 2 guides that were provided for me, I will give them a rating on the average of the 2 guides.#1- New site old method. Fast turnaround of funds. I really like the idea of the site used in this one. It's seriously vulnerable for fraud attempts. This method can be used on a consistent day-to-day basis. Small investments = medium returns. Can be used every single day without any problem, ofcourse, until they can catch up with their security.#2- This method was actually sold by a different vendor before. However, StrattonOakmont, yet again, gave a site that is really vulnerable for fraud. As stated in the guide, 90% of the time, you will be successful. The site is newbie-friendly. However, even if the site is bad, you should still practice your carding setup well. VPN - SOCKS5 of CH.ORIGINALITY = âââââ°4/5. Just because I base it on personal experience. I guarantee you'll get your money back the same day. The resources are widely available, the guide teaches you everything you have to know to earn money.USAGE = âââââ°REALLY REALLY easy. However, I still had to rate it on the average of both of the guides. Both of the guides will still depend on the CH. Early chargeback = early failure. So try to use BINs with 1940-1950 DOBs.OVERALL = âââââ°I gave the vendor an estimate on how I would FAIRLY price it, I gave him $1400 since the ROI can be just 1 day. I suggest working with a team to earn more. A saturation is likely. Again, the method is not saturate-able, it's just the niche. A good way to expand is just do Google searches depending on the niche, make sure they are not run by the same company, and success is inevitable.PROS[â] Newbie-friendly.[â] Detailed guide.[â] The guide alone will answer most of your questions.[â] With more research, you can stop your dayjob, setup a team to make more money.[â] OVERLY UNDER-PRICED!CONS[â] Must have good resources to secure a better success.[â] Might be saturated if sold to many, or at worse, leaked.I DO NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE GUIDE/METHOD I REVIEWED. HOWEVER, I CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS IF I WANT TO.;moka wrote:I agree.  I was given a vouch copy yesterday and it's a very solid guide.  The price alone is worth the PP -> BTC method."

This is the list of things I find from his service:1. The first time I sent him an email, he responds in minutes. And every other emails were replied just as quick.2. I had no BTC at first, so he extended the deadline for his offer. Not only that, he kept it at the special price.3. I never used this market before, so I didn't know how to pay him, but he gave me a step-by-step guide to uploading funds etc.4. And when I found out that the rate has moved so much that my fund is insufficient to cover the price, he gave me an additional discount. What can I say? The service is excellent. StrattonOakmont, you have a very satisfied customer. Will definitely look forward to see another offer from you. Two thumbs up!!",""

"Evolution Forums","dddima","42212","2015-01-10T09:46:28","Re: RDP awarness","Security & Anonymity","This depends which kind of hacked RDP you have. If you have RDP on some company server, they ussaly uses windows domain. That means these RDP's act like a ""terminals"". So if you login to it, you will kick someone out, if they login they kick you out. Again that means the only one person can use this RDP at the time. So if you do something they not see anything because they need to login first. But when they login, they will see your tasks running The other kind of RDP is when you have it on regular pc. Not windows domain. In this case when you login,user will not be kicked out, and he will see what you are doing live.But remmember in all cases there is always logs in windows, so be sure to clear them.  If this is RDP on windows domain server - no.If this is RDP on regular/single user pc - yes. This is very hard question, many people was asking me when i was selling rdps. Depends Depends how smart, not lazy admin/user is.Depends what you are doing on rdp. If you start cracking hashes, and you will eat all cpu admin notices that, and thats over. If you leave Advenced Mass Mailer running on admin or on active user account, when they login - busted.Don't use active users or admin accounts.

Get different identities for each PO box, you'll need a decent quality fake drivers license. In addition to this you need a utility bill, you can buy one on the evo marketplace. Edit each one to match the details for each fake identity. When you register for the PO box be careful to not be recognized signing up for two different boxes under different names, you are fucked if this happens. Make sure anyone who helps you only sees one identity, you'll most likely need to find multiple offices to pull off anymore than 2. Generally if you can locally run, non commercialized mail operations you have less risk of consequences. Pay in cash or prepaid giftcard, really doesnt matter. Paying with $400 in cash shouldn't arouse any suspicion if that is the price for the PO box, however you can use a prepaid if you are feeling nervous. Keep you comings and goings as minimal as possible for each PO box, try and coordinate shipping times so you get everything at once and can grab it all in one sweep. NEVER keep all your identities on you, that is a recipe for disaster. Keep in mind you'll most likely be providing forged documents to a federal employee, which is a whole nother charge. Good luck man, hope this helps.",""

I have seen places that will take just an ID to rent a mailbox, others need a little more. key is some may just visually verify your ID and not require scans of it. they also will sign for any pack from any carrier like DHL, FedEx, UPS.

There are countless ways to cashout, and I give you access to some, using your resources (CCs or PPs) in combination with your knowledge of carding. I give you a few sites where you can cashout quickly, but again, doing so, will make it have a life span that is short, and so, I'll tell you how to search such cashout sites.  Again, the actual guide to cashout the CCs has a short lifespan, so I'd buy this ASAP to avoid saturation and benefit from it. Price is 0.25 BTC unless stated.

That doesn't say nothing about this method. If you trust me, you can trust Altair "

Remember, TextSecure doesn't archive/store old text message prior installing TextSecure on your phone. Lock your phone with password (like 10+ char) and do not give it to LE. If they ask for your password, say nothing or ""I don't remember.."". 3) Encrypt your phone and repeat what I just told you via #2.  Another concern: you should encrypt your external storage: some Android phones have this option.  LE is shit out of luck. GET A LAWYER!

Do that each night gear is never in the premises of were the warrant is issued have nothing to do with downstairs and tell no rats and thats a good way. Best way employ someone and deal in kilos and not shot smalls #bing And they do fuk your house up even give you a smack but now most high end raids i no been involved in a few long story they were head cameras like when they come and extract you from a cell in the block in the uk id say usa also.

"Evolution Forums","studiouspanda","41729","2015-01-17T06:21:36","Re: House raided by UK police - experiences?","Security & Anonymity","BEST IDEA in this whole thread. In Barry Cooper's ""Never Get Raided Again"" he tells you to rub weed all over everything. As a supplement to that idea, you could get an extra potent strain of marijuana, or melt some wax, lots of it, and mix that with a small amount of paint, or put on a board/frame/furniture/painting etc. and put that far away from where you keep your real stash. Think of it as a Bug Zapper for drug dogs...  Very strong... Drug dogs at the border can smell drugs in sealed containers that are in steel compartments inside of car gas tanks, as well as inside of wheel axles and other metal stuff. Every material is porous, so they can smell through everything. However, what does change based on the material, is how porous, and therefore how long it takes for the odor to seep out. If you seal your drugs inside of a MBB, and are extremely careful to avoid contamination, it wont be detectable at all by a dog for a few days at least. This means you need to avoid touching drugs then touching outside of the bag, and also touching inside the bag above the spot that gets sealed (lip of the bag). Best way to avoid contaminating the lip is to roll up the bag before you put your drugs in it. Also means using a very controlled setup for packaging, down to having one clean room for putting the drugs in the bag, and another room for bleach washing the outside of the bag and double sealing. Someone probably snitched on you. That, or they found everything they needed very quickly in that room. Only way they'd know where to look is if someone told them. The UK police rarely abuse their powers (compared to american cops), so that means that if they have a pretty good idea you're up to something they can raid you and there's not much you can do to prevent it other than not showing up on their radar ever. In the US, they have to pay for damages, but they can take all of your property. Forfeiture laws are so fucking fucked up. Some guy in NORML got his house raided because he was growing weed. They fucked everything up good and proper, and found that he was growing weed, so the same day of the raid, they brought multiple semi-sized moving trucks and took all his property under kingpin laws that were meant to disrupt major trafficking organizations financially. Eventually, he got all criminal charges dropped, and he did absolutely nothing wrong, because everything was grown legally under medicinal marijuana laws, and conservatively at that. He could have 6 plants per person, but he had maximum 3 per person who was part of the collective, and the total was very meager compared to even small scale grow operations. He was legally allowed to fight the forfeiture to try and get his hundreds of thousands of dollars in property back. However, since this would delay the auctioning of his property, he was required to pay for storage of all of his stuff while he fought it. Given that they took multiple container-sized loads of property, storage costs were outrageous. Additionally, law enforcement has an enormous list of things they can do to delay the legal process. By the time he could fight it, he would've paid for more than the value of his stuff, with no guarantee he'd get it back. Police gave 0 fucks about the criminal charges, they just wanted to take his shit. It's basically legal armed robbery.","OneTwoThreeFour wrote:I heard about someone who mixed small quantities of lots of drugs (speed, coke, weed, etc.) into tins of paints.Then he painted his full house which meant there were traces of drugs in every room.

I don't remember depth, but their sense of smell is amazing. No number could do it justice. They can smell your neighbor walking by from the airflow coming from a worn gasket on your front door. The police will look until they find something to justify their raid. Otherwise, they look like chumps. So, you can bet that if it's not there, or hidden elsewhere, they probably will leave a dent -- and good luck suing the cops for property damage, sounds like a bad idea written all over it, assuming you could afford the attorney.

You put the cd or dvd into your computer, youbootit up, and you follow the instructions in order to install the operating system. Virtual machineswork similarly. Before we can use a virtual machine, we have to install an operating system on it.However, we are *NOT* going to use Windows! We are going to use Linux. Do not be afraid if youhaveno experience using Linux. I assure you that this will prove to be painless. We actually need twodifferent linux operating systems in order to have a secure system.

My bad. A DNS leak with go to your ISP DNS servers instead of your VPN DNS or other anonymity DNS server. Obviously depending on what you're doing this will result in your ISP being able to track your internet movements, web sites visited,etc... So if your computers are still configured to use default DNS servers issued by your ISP instead of the intended ones this will result in a DNS leak. Your ISP will know what DNS queries you made and that it was you who made them. Which case and point can lead things back to you via methods discussed.   Apologies for the confusion.  In a nutshell just know it can leak your true IP. If you take anything away from this thread take that.","peter_lustig_12 wrote:How is the merchant supposed to see my real IP when there is a DNS leak?

"Evolution Forums","foxskull","6951","2014-04-11T23:08:23","Re: What if there is a DNS Leak","Security & Anonymity","When an application is leaking DNS its trying to resolve the domain name outside what the user intended. So lets use TOR as an example. i go to shadymarketplace.onion. TOR has no need for DNS because it resolves its own request in a different way. However if it was misconfigured at the same time my computer would reach out to a few DNS servers that my ISP dictated the responsibility of resolving domain names to.  Naturally, they would get a request to resolve the domain name ""What is the IP address to shadymarketplace.onion"". They wouldnt know, so they wouldnt respond, but they would likely keep on asking the tier below it for the resolution and the request just dies. However technically speaking they would get a request to resolve that domain name, and that might be suspicious. They couldnt see what ur saying or what ur doing because all the information is encrypted, but they could see what sties you visit. Coupled with timing attacks youre alias can become know. if im missing anything lmk.

You can't use a live Whonix USB setup as far as I know, as you need both the gateway and workstation. Also running Whonix from USB isn't going to solve your memory problems, as the USB OS is simply using your computer's RAM. But honestly 2GB should be sufficient for running Whonix.

Of course more RAM never hurts and will make things go much smoother. I'm not even sure what kind of laptop would only ship with 2GB RAM now.","Android wrote:frapedaki12 wrote:16gb RAM???

There are a lot of information available on the forums. Though Evolution forum is good, I would recommend TCF Wiki and Forum. All you need is patience not BTC to learn something.  No money comes easily. Try to understand how different methods work like carding, Dumps, Paypal, etc. See what problems the users  have come across and how can they be solved. If you give your amount of time, you can find all the info for free. But, of course some Guides are personally developed and sold. See the vendors reputation. Do not buy when a vendor says ""Hey, I am blah...blah from TCF and I am a vouched member there"". Because this has become a common phrase that everyone uses now. Most of them are not from TCF. and HAPPY LEARNING.",""

"Evolution Forums","Yasuo","5230","2014-06-25T11:33:53","Re: ----------","Guides Vendors","@Night, what leaked guide? @baxinho, it works worldwide. Apparently, there's a new way to cashout instant in EU now. [Higher chance with UK Paypals]. I'm currently 1/3 with it. Deposit the funds, received it within 25-30 minutes. If this doesn't get burned or if I think this will not be saturated, this will be added to the update. New stuff for US as well. I also found another way for Paypal to BTC. It's basically Paypal - deposit to site - withdraw as BTC. It's not Virwox and doesn't have any verification with Virwox. The current limit is $2k in BTC per week. You'll lose 10% as a fee on using their site. It's actually the perfect Paypal laundering site, however you need a Facebook account which makes it really weird. Also still in testing mode.

I'm doing 10 of these. So if all 10 are successful, that's an easy $38,000. However, need to be cautious and still stay under the radar.I have discovered 5 more cashout methods today.

When people leak your guide and resell it for 1/5 of the original price? Aren't you going to do things to make their lives harder?I'm not going to say what I exactly did, but the way things are done shouldn't be as easy as before.The new method is easy and it won't saturate unless a HUGE site closes down.

Some guys steal my websites whole articles and even *css . 4-5 years ago, i was fighting with them but i'm tired now. At the end, i believe when we on internet, everything could be leak as you pointed.You can just do more hard it for leakers. For example, you can divide your guide 10 parts as *jpg format (with a watermark) and upload them 10 different sources.Or you can create password protected wordpress pages and upload your guide parts etc. i really cant know absolutely solution as i said. Believe me, i tried every possible solution from adding some codes to *htaccess to control visitors one-by-one. it's not possible for now. You can only delay duration. if it come to mind any other good solution, i'll update post. Good luck with your sales.I'm playing League of Legends and used a tool called Bot of Legends.Somehow, something popped on my mind regarding HWID. This may be suspicious to other people as getting their burner/personal computer information would be really sensitive. But I was planning to put the guide in a HWID-oriented system. Where I have to register their HWID first and then only the registered HWIDs can access it.But still, this is too much hassle and people can probably decrypt it and all. I guess, on the opening sales of v4.5, I will exclusively sell it to trusted members before making it public."

So fucking greedy and disrespectful.Would you kindly confirm that 4.5v is available and if it is could you post a link to when I can buy it or maybe PM ?  Also from what I understood, you would need to invest  200-400$ of your own money to start moving stolen money around ? I literary have no one I could trust or involve in this and I was planning to do all of this ""business"" on my own at coffee shop.  Can I still do this on my own ? 5000$ per week max is more than enough for me right now. Thank you for your time and answers. P.S Ahh and thank you all for such a wonderful organized place...well much more organized than other places This forum is a great place to start.

First of all, huge kudos for the great support mrwaterhands! Explained perfectly what was included in the guide beforehand on ICQ in detail. And responded even to the noob questions i asked him. Bought the guide while talking with him, he sent the guide instantly after making the order. Now to the guide : It's not a one way guide. With this i mean he writes up different methods to do it (harder and easier ones) It's fairly easy to read, and provides links to different websites where to get the stuff you need. And even after providing the links he gives tips on how to use it optimally. So overall, if you're completely new to this i suggest you to get this guide. For more experienced people you could buy this guide as refference, and to check if there's any improvements to be made using this. Not to mention he always answers you on ICQ this is the perfect vendor! Forgot to say, this is not just about cashing out your paypal, but also on how to fund these!",""

"Evolution Forums","BillBryson","12542","2014-06-15T10:18:55","Re: Delete","Guides Vendors","Hi folks, I received my guide yesterday -- credit to mrwaterhands for having a super quick turnaround time. I paid and had the guide within the hour.  As a complete noob to PP transfers, the guide is exceptionally helpful. It covers everything that you need to know in great detail, and links are also included on where you can acquire the things you need for a successful transfer.  You can either ask a hundred questions on here and get a number of varying replies, or you can buy mrwaterhands' guide - which explains everything you could wish to know. The information within will give you a solid foundation on which to build your knowledge.  10/10",""
